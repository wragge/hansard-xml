<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak against that motion. I believe that the Senate should insist on this amendment. I moved this amendment to hold the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to his word. He announced that this would be a trial program for 10,000 young unemployed Australians. The bill that we were presented with allows the principle of work for the dole to be extended to all or most unemployed Australians at a time of any future government's choice. I do not believe that is appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I extended the sunset clause time frame because the minister argued that 18 months was not enough time for them to do a proper 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> evaluation. A proper evaluation is important, but I do not mean a departmental evaluation where ministers choose to tell us what they think assists their case; I mean a parliamentary evaluation. We are now denied that opportunity because the Labor Party is prepared to allow this government, for reasons which it now has on the public record, firstly, to implement the scheme as is and, secondly, to deny the parliament further scrutiny of this&mdash;and it is in some respects, in its design, a little controversial&mdash;system of requiring, of compelling, young unemployed Australians to work for the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The least we can do is insist on this amendment. Are you going to tell me that this government, with its appalling record on job creation, is going to go to a double dissolution on the wider issue of whether there should be a two&hyphen;year evaluation time frame for this scheme? Of course, they are not. It is silly for Labor to back down on this one important amendment which actually reflects the Prime Minister's words. It holds the government to a trial which would be evaluated and requires the government to come back to the parliament before they can extend the principle of work for the dole indefinitely at a time when it suits them electorally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what we are doing. That is what we are being asked to do in the chamber today&mdash;to give them the blank cheque as usual. It is not good enough. This is not a costly amendment and it is not an amendment that would hamper the government. It is an amendment that requires appropriate scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While Labor might like to argue about labour market programs and their amendments related to those, the fact is that this is an amendment that they should be willing to insist upon as well because they, too, professed concerns&mdash;and serious concerns&mdash;about the capacity of this legislation to be misapplied in the future. It is very disappointing that Labor will not join other senators in this place in insisting on this important amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a pretty pass we have come to in this place! Last week, there was a defiant expostulation by Labor, the Democrats, the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4934"> Greens and the Independents on the need for a review of this draconian piece of legislation, which vindictively picks out young people in this country who cannot get a job, not because they are unable to work or do not want to but because as a society and, in particular, due to government policy, there are no jobs for them to take. So 10,000 people are going to be picked out of the 810,000 unemployed in this country and told, `If you don't take this job, you're going to have any sustenance, your right to unemployment benefits, taken away from you.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The young people are going to be selected in areas of high unemployment&mdash;regional areas of Australia. It is not going to be for the North Shore; it is not going to be for Kooyong. This is going to be for people in the western suburbs. People in regional Australia are going to be picked out at the combined whim of the government and, a little further down the line&mdash;mark you my words&mdash;private employment agencies, which are there for profit and which are going to want to get long&hyphen;term unemployed people off their books. They will flick them into a compulsory work for the dole scheme and, if they default, they will lose all income. As a result, at the end of the day, there will be a twofold disbenefit coming out of this, if you leave aside the feelings of those people caught in this trap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, we are going to have people without income in this country. We are going to have young, active, energetic and disillusioned young people feeling the fair go has passed them by. In fact, by law they have been cut out of it in a lottery system that is beyond their control, because for other people next door who are also long-term unemployed this does not affect them. These people are selected by processes unknown to them to participate in a forced work program which gives them no skilling and no long-term prospects of a job, but which picks on them in a vindictive way for a little bit of gratuitous punishment to feed the feelings of disgruntled people paying taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a few wowsers and mingy people in our society who feel they have to punish somebody because they do not like paying taxes, even in a country with high unemploy 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment. They pick on some young people who have little ability to fight back and make them work in very often nonproductive and certainly not fulfilling jobs for a period of time as an example to the rest of society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If those young people fall out of the welfare net, they are going take to the streets. We are going to see more locks on doors. We are going to see more people begging in the streets. We are going to see an increase in panhandling, as the Americans call it. We are going to see people unable to enjoy the security that Australia has valued in the past, because we are going to see increasing crime as a result of forced work of this variety being imposed on young people who are not at fault. The fault lies with our society and with governments, but we have not got the nous and the wherewithal to bring in programs which are going to ensure a better spread of work and a better opportunity for all Australians to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Harradine said yesterday or the day before, people have a right to access unemployment benefits when society cannot provide the jobs to go round. But instead of a right here, we have a punishment. It is ethically wrong. It is morally wrong. It is bankrupt. It is vindictive. It is nasty. It stands against this nation's ethos of a fair go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, it is going to displace people out of proper full pay jobs with proper conditions. That is the overseas experience. Let me reiterate that in New York there are some 36,000 people on forced work schemes like this and it is estimated that they have replaced over 20,000 full-time jobs. The people who worked in parks, street cleaning and secretarial jobs on full pay and proper benefits have been replaced by people on forced work schemes who are living on a minimal wage&mdash;the dole wage it will be in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opinion polls might at first reaction have shown that a majority of Australians favour this scheme, but there has been precious little public debate about it. I have seen nothing from those people who are going to be targeted. I have seen no case put by them. They do not even know who they are yet and they are certainly not going to have an opportunity to speak up in their defence as this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4935"> vindictive scheme&mdash;now backed by Labor and the Democrats&mdash;comes into being.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kernot says that that is misleading, but let me say this. Last week, the rot set in here when the Democrats voted against Labor amendments which would have enabled work skilling to be put into this program, which would have insisted that there be a skilling component in these forced work schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a tit for tat, the Labor big boys got together on the weekend and yesterday morning and decided here was their out. The Democrats blocked provisions to ensure that skilling be brought into this program so at least these forced labourers would have some chance of getting a job afterwards. Labor said, `We will drop our opposition to compulsion. We will support these young people being made to work in this vindictive fashion.' While the two parties of social justice bickered with each other, the government got the rails run on this and got through.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday I moved in the committee stage that we report progress while these two parties got together and solved this problem on behalf of the unemployed people who were going to be targeted. As you will remember, Senator Margetts and I went alone to the other side of the chamber and were voted down by Labor, by the Democrats and by the conservative parties voting in unison to bring in this work for the dole scheme. That is where we are at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the Greens versus the rest on this score whereas we all stood on this side last week to amend this legislation so that there would be a skilling program that was not compulsory&mdash;something that was constructive for unemployed people in this country; something that meant this money was going to be put to a productive purpose with young people being fulfilled as a result of it. They had the option to go into this scheme and to get some skilling while they were at it, small as it might be&mdash;a little step towards constructive assistance for those people who have drawn the short straw in this country and who cannot get a job, simply because successive government policies have led to an unemployment rate of over eight per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a pretty low day for the other opposition parties that we have come to this. But what about the great Labor Party, the party of social justice, which went belly&hyphen;up yesterday, caved in to the government and was prepared to use the young people unemployed in this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4936"> country, who cannot stand up for themselves, as fodder in their backdown because they were concerned about the political outcome? What a low day! What a depth for the Labor Party to come to&mdash;this party of social justice, which should be standing for these very people who cannot stand up for themselves. Did they hit rock bottom? Did the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, and his party hit the bottom of the barrel yesterday?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are they going to repeat that today when they cave in even further on a simple amendment from the Democrats, which we backed and which says, `At least have a sunset clause in this. Let us have a review of where it goes further down the line.' But, belly&hyphen;up, the Labor Party says, `No, we can't even stand up for the disadvantaged in this country to the point where we would think about having a review two years down the line.' What a disgrace the Labor Party has become! What hollowness there is to those words of social justice which this once&hyphen;great Labor Party is supposed to stand for. It strikes me that it is more persistent and has far greater vigour in this place when standing for the multinational corporations on issues like the $800 million handout in diesel fuel rebates to the mining corporations than it has for those people who are living on the poverty line in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a disgraceful backdown. It is shocking. You&mdash;through you, Madam Chair&mdash;should be ashamed of yourselves. The Labor Party has hit a new low. It does not deserve to be the opposition, and it has abandoned the very people it should be standing up for in this matter. There is not a political argument that can justify this contempt for the very people you would have us believe that you stand for&mdash;the very people that you have abandoned and the very people that you have welshed on. You have sold out in this infamous little exercise in political retreat, double backflip and abandonment of principle.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME><STATE> (New South Wales&mdash;</STATE><ROLE>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP>(12.48 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate to the Senate that, as the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, indicated in the House of Representatives last night, the opposition will not be opposing the bill in the form that it has been returned from 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the House of Representatives. Hence we will be supporting the government's motion before the chair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the opposition is concerned, we are going to end once and for all the charade that this government has been running for a long time to divert attention from its complete failure to tackle unemployment in Australia. When the government's bill was introduced in the House of Representatives, the Labor Party vigorously pursued a number of amendments, and the government now has to answer for its own rhetoric. We tried to transform this ill&hyphen;considered proposal into a comprehensive quality training and skill based labour market program but, of course, those amendments were defeated by the government's numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Soon after the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced the scheme, which I think was in February, we also acted to refer the bill to a Senate committee for detailed examination and community consultation. Several public hearings of the committee were held, and a substantial minority report was published by opposition senators on the committee, which has clearly put on record our concerns about the flaws in this bill. When the bill reached the Senate, the Labor Party again moved amendments to turn the bill into a proper labour market program with firm guarantees that it would not lead to the displacement of existing paid workers. However, unfortunately, the Australian Democrats and Senator Colston voted with the government to defeat those crucial amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I foreshadowed last week that the Labor Party would move in the Senate to amend the government's work for the dole scheme, that was in the context of submitting our decent training and skills programs, which were also compulsory but, unlike the government scheme, offered real choice and opportunities. We will not let the government divert attention from its failure to create real jobs by running a nasty and divisive campaign to blame the victims of unemployment, and that has been our intention all along.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jobs will be the issue in the next election&mdash;not manipulating community prejudices against those who cannot get jobs, nor the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4937"> side issue of whether some individuals should or should not be compelled into work. The fact is that the 10,000 places in the government's work for the dole scheme, with no training, do not even match the number of real jobs lost under this government in just one week in May this year. We on the Labor side made it clear early in this debate that we would be presenting a clear and better alternative to the work for the dole scheme. We also made it clear that, if the government did not accept this alternative, it would have to wear the consequences of its flawed scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We presented our alternative, but the most essential features of that have been rejected. So, as Mr Beazley said last night, it is the government that has to wear the consequences of its mickey mouse scheme. There cannot be any more smokescreens. We are acting to make sure that the focus, starting from today and running right up until the next election, stays fairly and squarely on the government and on the job crisis that the government has created in this country and that is mounting by the month.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will soon become apparent that the criticisms that we have clearly put on the record, our criticisms of the work for the dole scheme, are valid. We will be rigorously monitoring the operation of this scheme as part of our efforts to expose the government's lack of real solutions to unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people will now be able to see even more clearly that the government does not care about solving unemployment and that the work for the dole scheme is doing nothing to help. This will enable people to vote for an alternative, to vote for the party which will do most to tackle unemployment. Our policy initiatives in the months ahead will make it even clearer that it is Labor, not the Howard government, which is regarded as the most competent party to tackle unemployment in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have indicated, Labor senators will not be opposing the motion before the chair because we want to ensure that the focus of the unemployment debate from now on is on the government's failure to deliver on job security for all Australians, and in order for us to open up the debate on real solutions to unemployment. </PARA>

Suffice to say that I do not want to wax eloquent about those matters because I feel rather sick in the stomach about what happened here yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now in a situation whereby we are being asked by the government not to insist upon the amendment that was adopted by the Senate. That amendment provides for a two&hyphen;year sunset clause. Why did we amend the legislation thus? Because we were dealing with a trial. Surely, in anybody's language, a trial must have a sunset. It must come to an end; otherwise it is not a trial. It must be evaluated; otherwise it is not a trial. In my view, we should reject the government's proposition that we not insist upon our amendment. I think it is reasonable that we should insist upon the amendment. If we do that, then it puts the government on notice that it has got to come back with a very thorough report on the efficacy or otherwise of the trial. I will be voting against the motion which is before the chamber.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we have seen in the last couple of days has been cynical, sleazy politics. The structural unemployment from which Australia is suffering is at what is called an economic up&hyphen;point; we are still at the point of growth. If we should find, for instance, that stock markets crash or that other potential international events occur, then instead of the rate of unemployment being at around nine per cent, it could go to 15 per cent or worse. It is at a high at nine per cent. But here we are, blaming unemployed people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party said the government must answer for its own rhetoric. No&mdash;it is the victims of structural unemployment who will suffer. This unemployment has been created by political and economic decision making. Structural unemployment is not choice unemployment; it is structural unemployment. Commentators would all agree that what we are suffering from is structural unemployment, not unemployment by choice. There is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4938"> always  a small percentage of choice, but that is not what Australia is suffering from at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know, because we have figures and we have reports, that the people who are already finding it most difficult to cope are those people who are most likely to be hived off into these schemes. They are not for everybody. It will be decided. It is not across the board. It will be, and is, discriminatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday Senator Brown offered to remove the excuse between Labor and the Democrats. Senator Kernot said today that they have not met and talked about it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a tiff going by. It might not be a tiff behind closed doors, but perhaps we could call it a tiff in the gallery. Perhaps we could call this the `spin tiff', which is going to fall over and affect thousands of people in Australia&mdash;not necessarily those people who say, `Yes, I would like the government to provide me with meaningful work. I don't want to be sitting around twiddling my thumbs and feeling my life is worthless.' What is the government actually going to provide for those people who really want to do something worth while with their life? What kind of funding does the government provide for those people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If any government were so sure about their own program being sound, so sure that it is not going to target the wrong people, so sure that it will lead to positive outcomes, then how could they refuse to review the program in two years time? No, they do not want to do

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is repeating the debate we had previously. These issues were raised in the debate when the matter was before the chamber earlier this week. I made it perfectly clear then that the principle of the work for the dole scheme is appropriate to be in this legislation, come what may.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that we are implementing a pilot program does not say, `Yea, we will go on to further programs afterwards' or `Nay, we will not.' The pilot program stands on its own. The implementation of the principle in the legislation also stands on its own. It is perfectly appropriate for the government to want to amend the social security legislation to allow for that principle to be enshrined in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We put a lot of requirements on people who are asking for social security income support in various ways throughout the legislation. There has been no requirement about compulsorily working for the dole, but there have been lots of other requirements which have also been compulsory. We are moving now, in a way which is consistent with countries around the world, to require flexible activity testing and a variety of ways that we can activity test people who ask for assistance from the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to prolong this debate any longer. Anybody who is interested in this issue is going to be able to read the whole <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of days of debate. Let it be quite clear, however, for those who do not know, that the question of evaluation has also been thoroughly examined in this place. There will be substantial evaluation by the department in time for the next budget and then in the second phase late next year. That has all been explained to the Senate; I do not want to go 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4940"> into more detail now. It simply only adds to the time delay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in addition, as I think I pointed out to you, Senator Kernot&mdash;it might have been to one of the other opposition parties&mdash;it is very clear that at any time the Senate chooses, they are able to evaluate any program of the federal government. Whether it is in this portfolio or in any other, the numbers in the Senate make it perfectly possible for the Senate to choose at any time to evaluate any program. So I think the grandstanding you have just been going on with does not become you. You have been told all that already.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Me thinketh the honourable senator protesteth too much. I am not going to respond to Senator Kernot, because the issue that is so important here is the plight of the young people who are going to be targeted by this compulsory scheme which has no training component, which does nothing to get them back into the work force, which simply sees them as a punishment vehicle for a pretty debased, vindictive streak that there is amongst a minority of people who think that people out of work should be punished, not given the opportunity to enjoy the advantages, including the fulfilment of life, that come out of work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honestly! The Labor Party are saying that they are going to support the government on this, because the government is going to stand indicted further down the line and they are going to go to the next election tackling the government over a measure which they are now supporting. What sort of twisted logic is that? What sort of hopeless attempt is that to excuse the inexcusable? The Labor Party is now supporting the work for the dole scheme and is ensuring that the government even gets its way on the Democrats' amendment to ensure that there is a review further down the line.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here we have got Senator Herron defending the Labor position. That is where we have got to. It is going to be interesting to see the final vote in this place. What we do know from what has happened this morning is that the Labor Party has given up its right to be called the party of social justice. That has become a much more confined thing in this parliament. I suppose it is one of those key points, one of those watersheds, one of those telling moments in the direction of our society, which is now so broadly affected by economic fundamentalism, which has no room for finer feelings, for ethics that Senator Kernot is concerned about, or for concern for others. Rather, we are prosecuting quarrels amongst ourselves. We ought to be able to do better than that in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, the whole problem arose because the two bigger opposition parties on this side could not get together and come to a mutual agreement to support each other's amendments in this place. Instead of that they fell apart and allowed the government through with a rails run, which is going to trample over the rights and even the aspirations to long-term work of young people, who are simply going to be seen as an expedient whipping group for the more venal and small&hyphen;minded and vindictive aspirations of a few people in our society who, unfortunately, tend to be concentrated in the support base of the parties opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator KERNOT</EMPHASIS> (Queensland&mdash;Leader of the Australian Democrats) (1.11 p.m.) I think there are a couple of disingenuous statements being made. It is disingenuous of Senator Brown to suggest that, when the Labor Party have made up their mind to bail out of an action, representation by the Democrats can change it, can change their mind when they have taken this particular decision, and I think in some respects it has been a damaging decision. When they have made up their mind, no entreaty from me or any other Democrat, I can assure you, Senator Brown, is going to persuade them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know why this decision was made. We are all capable of understanding that. It is disingenuous for you to reflect that the Demo 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4941"> crats could have gone to the Labor Party and saved this bill. Once Labor made up its mind, that was the end of it and we know that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the minister: is it not disingenuous of you, Minister, to argue that a trial is a trial, even if it is unlimited? How can you argue that? You are asking the parliament to give you the unlimited right to do this. What is the point of a trial, except for you to get your own evaluation? How can you argue that it is a trial? Why do you not just say, `We are enshrining the principle and that is that. And on the way we are going to conduct our own evaluation.'? But it is not a trial any more.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicated to the government yesterday that there are four bills in the list&mdash;two of them are about the sale of cars, one is about telecommunications and one is about higher education. The only one that the Greens (WA) would agree to exempt from the cut&hyphen;off motion is the telecommunications bill. The other three do not have our agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no urgency for rushing towards providing a subsidy for private car producers. That is what it is basically. It means that they are exempt and somehow or other there is this false level playing field which means that somehow private fleet owners are treated like government entities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other bill in relation to higher education, in my opinion, is not urgent. It certainly is not urgent to provide measures which end up being punitive in the medium to longer term on education. My understanding is that this could be done in the next session in the normal turn of events. It is not until next year that the government will try to do these horrible things to students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, the only bill upon which you have agreement from the Greens (WA) in relation to urgency, which is what we are being asked to deal with today&mdash;let alone non&hyphen;controversiality, which I guess we will have to deal with again later&mdash;is the telecommunications bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This year's budget was actually far worse than it was generally portrayed. Last year there was the big announcement of the black hole into which government would consign the community sector. There were some nasty taxes on students, the young, the old, migrants and the perennial target of this government&mdash;Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. But it was just the beginning. A lot of the debt reduction was based on announcements that government would sell Telstra, the airports, Commonwealth car fleet and various other mobile and immobile assets&mdash;everything including those things which had been bolted down, I guess. There was a huge attack on workers but that did not increase revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the real poison in the bottom of this chalice was not last year's budget; it was the forward estimates. For example, last year it was estimated that, in the budget year, higher education grants would stay nominally about 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the same, a decline in real terms of about three per cent, but that this year they would be cut by 6.3 per cent in dollar terms, or 9.5 per cent in real terms. In this budget they were actually cut by 5.6 per cent in dollar terms or 10 per cent in real terms. That can be taken as the base data. It was not a budget measure and deserved no real attention. It was not a change because it was announced last year. There was nothing in the budget measure statement that said that $240 million would be lopped from this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Likewise, when the increase in TAFE funding of 2.8 per cent is below inflation, this is not noteworthy. It is according to last year's plan. Actually, it is a cut from last year's forward estimates which indicated TAFE funding would increase by 4.8 per cent. It seems that this government has been learning from the methods of the last government in terms of the way it presents accounts. Next year's forward estimates indicate that there will be an increase of only 0.6 per cent while inflation is expected to be up to 4.5 per cent. Public primary and secondary school funding increased one per cent in dollar terms, a decrease of 3.5 per cent in real terms. Next year is about the same. The year following, 1990&hyphen;2000, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) hedged his bet by suggesting primary education is only set to increase by 0.8 per cent in dollar terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In health, veterans' health and general practice reforms in rural incentives programs all go down in real or dollar terms. The preventative health area, the area that deals with vaccinations, women's health, AIDS, drug strategies, family planning and youth suicide prevention was cut by 11 per cent in dollar terms, 15.6 per cent in real terms. Next year, it will go down another 17 per cent in dollar terms or 22.7 per cent in real terms. It has been cut from $293 million last year to $215 million in 1998-99.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Health support services, the blood banks and so on, get cut by four per cent in this budget. Health research was not hit this year, but have a look at the forward estimates. Next year it is pegged to drop by 14.3 per cent and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4944"> the year after by 14.1 per cent. This is a huge drop but totally consistent with the government's attitude on research generally and on social welfare specifically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big targets in health for this budget were doctors who bulk&hyphen;bill, and those patients who have chronic illnesses such as heart and circulatory disease and those with emotional and mental health problems requiring ongoing medication. The new pharmaceutical scheme is also likely to affect those requiring multiple antibiotics, those with diseases like multiple resistant TB&mdash;the disease of the growing urban poor&mdash;and those hospitalised and therefore exposed to staph aureus and other such infections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The undermining of ordinary Medicare by refusing to increase Medicare fees sets the stage for the abandonment of bulk&hyphen;billing. I would say cynically that this is the intention of government. Health care will become just like education&mdash;free in theory but in actuality a movable feast of free and fee, with the fee component becoming bigger each year. For those who are not actually unemployed or on a pension, gone is the time you could find a doctor who bulk&hyphen;billed. Soon, even those who are card carrying poor will not be able to find such treatment. The outcome will be that the poor simply stop getting treatment with a consequent reduction in health. It will particularly affect the young, those with poor parents and the old who did not expect a pension to have to cover a growing range of medical costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also see the spectre of community sector punishment. I put it as three stages&mdash;the government gets them to shut up, cutback and shut down. That is what I believe. It says, `Stop talking; stop speaking out; and when you have lost the ability to speak out for yourself, then we get rid of you.' That is what is happening and it is happening more and more. My advice is, don't keep quiet; at least go noisily. It will make a difference of only one year, in my opinion, for those community groups who are doing a good job. If they are quiet, it will mean perhaps they will be forgiven for an extra year, but they will go in the end.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is dumb. It is very bad economic and social policy because, in the end, it is the community support groups in self&hyphen;help and preventative areas who end up stopping the crisis spending in education, in social issues and in health. It is the community groups who are extremely good value. Cutting from them is false economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, most of the real erosion of universal social services occurred as forward estimates and so warrants no attention in budget papers. Even if it warrants attention, it gets none. Such major cuts are in the forward estimates for the next two years. The slashing and burning is being done quietly, behind the scenes, so to speak. We all know it is happening, but it is hard to address since there is no legislation for these cuts&mdash;none save these bills, the appropriation bills. Senator Brown and I have some amendments to this legislation, and I will speak to mine presently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year we had the bill that would bust unions, and workplace relations, and was designed to make workers more helpless in negotiation, exchanging collective bargaining for direct negotiations between each worker and management. This year, the government is working on increasing the number of unemployed&mdash;making their situation as grim as possible to ensure that, when workers are negotiating, the only possible option to accepting whatever an employer offers is poverty, a steady reduction of any assets they might retain and a hopeless choice of involuntary servitude or starving on the streets. This is not a training program&mdash;and we have just had this debate&mdash;work for the dole is punishment for unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of the general worsening of the lot of the poor, in real terms we have declining budgets for the aged, disabled veterans, the unemployed and the sick. We also have budgets which decline in both real and dollar terms for veterans, the non&hyphen;veteran disabled, parents, pregnant women, widows, Australian victims of disasters and asylum seekers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a planned major targeting of those on welfare, with the object of increasing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4945"> penalty income by 26.4 per cent. It is not so much that there are rorts; this is a budget&hyphen;driven policy and a lot of it is accomplished when the payments are made. The fact that the government plans to make so much money out of it indicates the payments will  be later, leaving those poor enough to meet government tests waiting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has answers. Not long ago we saw him in a factory boasting of how the production of fighter planes may not replace all the jobs lost in the BHP steel closure but that it would go a long way. Personally, I do not think Australia's future is in the production of weaponry. It is a very inefficient way of using our resources, whether it is subs or fighters or Styer rifles or even trip&hyphen;wire grenades that are not really grenades, although they do tend to blow off people's legs reasonably effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of our amendments is to reduce the level of spending on war toys to last year's level. As an example, the funding for higher education grants, for which the Commonwealth paid $3.906 billion last year and proposes to pay $3.690 billion this year, is to be cut by $216 million. But the budget for defence equipment went from approximately the same base of $3.945 billion to $4.134 billion&mdash;an increase of $198 million, according to budget paper No. 1. I propose to eliminate division 183, defence production. That is a cost saving of $17.8 million. This is money we spend on promoting the sale of arms overseas and other issues involved with that immoral trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly&mdash;and I know that this is a point of disagreement with government&mdash;I believe that there are many things that would do more for the nation than buying or selling war toys. Education is one option. Preventative health is another. Reversing the decrease in the housing budget is yet another. There are hundreds of cuts that look minor, though they are substantial cuts to specific programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My point is simply that it is indicative of government priorities when they are cutting social services in almost every sector because of dire economic news, but they are increasing the budget for war toys. I cannot understand why the most up-to-date capacity to kill 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people is so much more important than providing wellbeing for our friends, our children, our parents, our brothers, and our sisters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also point out that I have, many times, indicated other areas where the government, if it had the will, could reduce expenditure or increase revenue, without damaging the poor. I have suggested that the diesel rebate to mining could be cut, bringing in at least $800 million. The government cries `Jobs'. But it has no worries about cutting in other areas that cost jobs, such as manufacturing, computers or information technology, education, and so on&mdash;and in government service provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government wished to do so, I have indicated several areas in which it could increase revenue through taxing the rich. It could set a level of taxation below which corporate taxes could not be minimised. It could reduce the level of dividend imputation to 50 per cent, since corporations do not pay their full tax. It could eliminate a lot of the rorts around negative gearing. We also suggested a way by eliminating deductions for salary sacrifice through superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it wanted to, government could easily do a huge amount for the environment by putting a carbon tax on energy. This could raise up to $7 billion per year&mdash;enough to substantially convert coal-fired power to wind and solar; enough to develop sophisticated systems for ensuring that most of the country's freight be transported by rail or sea; enough to substantially support energy efficiency, and to make a good start on restructuring cities. This is not, and it need not be, a painful thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A restructured urban environment and transport system would allow better and cheaper access to transport, while increasing equity and amenity&mdash;and employment. Life could be better, and we would not need to import oil, as we do now. We then would be relatively immune to many resource price shocks that we are likely to see. We would also probably develop competitive industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could do a lot. But this government suffers from a failure of imagination and vision. Most of all, it suffers from a failure of empathy, sympathy and compassion.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4946">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not at this point put forward any specific transfers for my amendment, except for the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. My amendment removes the excuse for some of the pettiest, mean&hyphen;spirited cuts that this government in this budget has  introduced. This government clearly is working in every way it can to unravel the fabric of the community and return us to some sort of competitive economic jungle. This will quickly become a real urban jungle with physical predators, if the evidence from the rest of the world has any parallels here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, it is interesting that one of the organisations it wishes to cut is the human rights watchdog. Twenty per cent of the budget is gone this year. Our amendment would restore that. It is not a lot, nor is it the only thing we need to maintain. But it is an indicative item. It is a focus item. It is the organisation most at risk from the ideology of this government, which seems hell&hyphen;bent on making sure that minorities and those most vulnerable get it in the neck. If enough insecurity has been created for everyone primarily to be concerned with their own skin and those most vulnerable are sacrificed, who will care? That is what scapegoat politics stems from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government goes one better. It tries to paint the vulnerable as non-humans, rorters, sly thieves or dole bludgers. They paint Aboriginal communities as having advantages over non-Aboriginal communities. They paint migrants as those who come to this country, wanting to live off the cream of our work. They paint students as those who make trouble and want handouts, instead of working for what they get. Does this all sound familiar? There are `young ingrate teenagers, who have nothing better to do than sit around and get drunk'; `old people, who are a burden on an ageing society'; `women, gays and the disabled, who think being victims gives them special rights'. No wonder the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) finds fertile ground where this government has spread its compost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The human rights commission is one of those organisations which will be decimated, according to forward estimates. In budget paper No. 1, protection of human rights 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> declines from $19.3 million last year to $17.8 million this year; in appropriations we see that it is actually a bigger decline. But in the budget papers we see that the decline is set to markedly increase, down to only $11.8 million. In other words, the funding for HREOC is about to be cut by nearly 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that this is disgraceful, and so I put this as an indicative amendment. It is not a lot. Obviously I will be speaking briefly to this amendment when it comes up in the committee stage of the bill. But I do commend our concerns to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly today because I am aware of time constraints in this particular debate. I just want to canvass a few things. In particular, the budget itself was a nothing budget. It did nothing for the unemployed, it did nothing for families, it did nothing for the elderly&mdash;and, of course, it did nothing for small business. All we have as a result, now, of two budgets from this current government is a flat economy, suffering retail sales and people in a certain amount of despair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People are scared to spend for fear of loss of jobs, and this leads to great insecurity in their lives. Jobs are the main issue and they hardly rate a mention in the budget brought down by the government. People want to have real jobs, not pretend jobs. They want security, and this government is not providing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to focus for a few minutes on what I consider to be the biggest blunder of the budget: the savings incentive scheme. This offered nothing to battlers who live from hand to mouth. It destroyed the concept of security in retirement by cutting a swathe through superannuation. There is no doubt that it has provided a barrier to super reaching 15 per cent, as it would have done under a Labor government. However, the 15 per cent barrier needed to be reached so that it would make certain a relevant and meaningful retirement package for those people when they reach retirement age. This is the very least that this budget has done for those people. Now those people will find themselves with their superannuation stuck at a high of nine per cent&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4947">clearly a level which is not sufficient for them to fund their retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing that came out of the savings incentive scheme was the ability for the opting out for those people who earn less than $450 per month between the award superannuation and the SG amount. This does  not do one thing for the retirement savings of those people. If anything, it substantially diminishes their savings. In the future, it could diminish their savings by up to six per cent&mdash;that is, the difference between award super being three per cent and the SG amount being nine per cent. These two initiatives of the government in the budget, which fell completely flat on its face, did nothing for the battlers that they so much pretended to represent on the occasion of their election. The government's saving program was a total insult to low income workers. It does nothing to improve their life or their lifestyle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having made those few brief remarks, I want to turn briefly to the Senate estimates committee report of June 1997. In that particular report there was an addendum by Senator Cook and me. It raises concerns about the estimates process. During the estimates process, our particular estimates committee, the addendum report states, was delayed from commencing from 9 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. on 10 June because no minister was available. I understand that ministers are busy from time to time, but if the process is to operate and to operate properly for all parties, if there is a commitment that the estimates will start at 9 a.m. on a certain day, we need a minister to be available. If we do not have a minister available, it certainly delays the process and it makes the whole functioning and operation of that estimates committee fairly difficult indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On two occasions during that particular set of estimates we failed to have the minister present. The minister left for some commitments unknown to me as to what they exactly were. Again, that left us in a real dilemma. It made the process of the estimates difficult indeed. There was no minister present to comment on matters of policy. What we were 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> able to traverse with the public servants were matters of fact in the budget estimates and the PBS, and that is quite right. But we needed a minister there to be able to traverse issues of policy. That was not made available to us, because on those two occasions the minister was absent. That was from about 9 o'clock at night, and the rest of us had to spend time in the estimates until 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock on those two occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, it is important that the government realise that, if this process is to work, they must have a minister there. Otherwise we could end up going down the road of the committee of the whole. As I understand it, that is not the desired process to be followed for the estimates process. I think the government need to get their act together and to ensure that, when estimates are on, we have ministers present so that they can answer questions of policy relating to the PBS.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are several matters I want to discuss in relation to schools and to disability services in this year's appropriation bills. The first relates to the youth allowance or the removal altogether of unemployment benefits for people aged 16 and 17 who are not in school or in other training. Like so many of the government's announcements over the past 12 months, this came, as it were, from the hip without any consideration about the effects of the proposal on our schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know there are more than 34,000 young Australians who are not employed and not in education or training. The Democrats are in favour of young people staying on in school until they have completed year 12 or moved on to other training. We are absolutely in favour of that as an objective. Every indicator of success in later life points to education. We continue to draw attention to the declining retention rates in virtually all states in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the reality is that for most of these young people they have left school because it no longer serves their needs. They do not see any point in staying on. When I went through secondary school, these young people left at year 10 to become mechanics, plumbers, secretaries or clerks. Very often 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4948"> they want to a tech school where the vocational link was very clear. They left school virtually at any age and they went straight into a job. The reality now is that the few jobs that are available to young people, even if they complete year 12, are extremely hard to get. Very often, they do not even use the qualifications that those students have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we all know, there is a much higher proportion of jobs than ever before in the service industry&mdash;casual part-time jobs as waiters, bar attendants and the like. It is very difficult to persuade young people without a decent job at the end of their 12 years of effort in school that it will be worthwhile. The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) points out that schools no longer appear to meet the needs of 75 per cent of their students who will not end up in university. This budget was the opportunity to do something about that, but it does not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government expects that it can force 34,000 students who have already chosen to leave school into training and back to school. Even if half that number return to school it would have an enormous impact on schools. In New South Wales alone the education department estimates that this measure would cost $59 million. Add to that the number of 15&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who would have left school but who will now stay in full&hyphen;time education and you have the makings of a very major problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has no answers. She does not even have any evidence that the financial incentive will shift young people back to schools or of the impact on those schools. Was this move discussed with principals, for instance? I do not think so. Her advice this week was that I should go back to schools and tell them to lift their game and start offering real opportunities to the 75 per cent of students who do not want to go to university. That was the advice to me. She said, `Give them real opportunities.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could speak at length here today about the sorts of initiatives that have been started for students for whom the structure and discipline of classrooms of 30 or more students are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> simply unsuitable. Let me start with a secondary college in Gippsland which had an outdoor education program running for students. The school acquired, through a disadvantaged schools grant, canoes, camping and abseiling gear and the like. These students benefited enormously in terms of ability, self-esteem, self-reliance, teamwork, vigorous physical exercise and the like. It sounds very good and it worked very well. The problem is that that school is now so short of funds that it cannot afford to employ an outdoor education teacher. That school is now having to fall back on the more formal subjects in classrooms. The minister for schools refers to these subjects as `core' subjects. Last year we heard a lot about the crowded curriculum in schools. We were told that there were too many unnecessary subjects. According to the minister these needed to be eliminated in our schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The group of students who have no desire to go to university will have to see out their time there. Many of those students have already failed to cope let alone excel in this environment. I ask the Senate to imagine how teachers and principals will cope with such students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going back to the story about the school in Gippsland, that outdoor education equipment which the school once used is now hired out to the local private school. This is indicative of what is going on in so many of our secondary schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More of these people are going to be returned to schools. People who return to education after some time in the work force usually make very good and very highly motivated students. But I ask you to consider how easy it will be for these students to cope and for the schools into which they will go&mdash;we can pretty well assume that they will be government schools&mdash;to cope with students who are there under duress. This budget does not, at least on the surface, cut funds from schools the way it does from other portfolio areas, but we have a system which is already grossly underfunded and which is waiting in fear and trepidation for the full impact of last year's states grants bill to come into effect.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4949">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Next year the enrolment benchmark adjustment will come into play and this is the mechanism which will see the government schools pay and keep on paying for the expansion of private schools. Even if government schools hold their enrolments, in 1998 money will be taken from government school budgets to pay for the additional numbers in private schools. The natural increase in enrolments over the next four years, as we all  know, is expected to be taken up by the private sector. Already we are seeing the emergence of new private schools, and many of them are moving into schools which were vacated by former government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last weekend Victoria's primary and secondary school principals held urgent meetings with the state government  after the release of a report which found that a significant majority of Victoria's 1,700 principals believe that the school system has been poorly managed by government bureaucrats and has failed to deliver improved outcomes for students. It reported increased workloads, scarce resources and plummeting job satisfaction. One principal, Mr Jim Newnan, was reported in the Sunday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Students are now seen in terms of dollars and clients. I used to know all the kids; now I don't know any because I haven't got the time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">His school, the Princes Hill Secondary College in Carlton, had its teaching staff cut by three, from 60 to 57, even though enrolments increased by more than 20 per cent. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe my staff have worked unreasonably hard in order to buffer the students from the effects of staff and budget cuts. The effect isn't on students; it is on staff and it's unfair.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The survey found that most primary and secondary school principals believe that inadequate resources were the cause of the system's inability to manage student problems and had led to big increases in truancy, expulsions and suspensions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the system that this government wants to push to breaking point. This system, according to the minister, has to lift its collective game. The problem for schools in Victoria, and no doubt in other states, is that there have been funding cuts. In Victoria this has meant $300 million over the last four 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years, and 350 schools and 8,000 teachers have been lost. We are told that in this budget there will be no new cuts. I hope that that will be the case, but the real problem is what the government expects of our school system. It is the unreasonable demands that are being made on the system with the miserable funds it receives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real problems will emerge in the future, however. What will the enrolment benchmark adjustment do to our government school system next year? How many parents will be persuaded that the only way they can have their children in well resourced schools is to shift them to the private sector? How many parents have no such choice? How many parents with three or four children even on an average to good income can afford to exercise that choice? This budget does not deliver good news for schools.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the important element of compulsion, we believe it is right that we can require a small number of the participants in work for the dole to enrol. But not Labor.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had these questions asked in the chamber before. We have had them asked extensively in estimates committees. One of the acknowledged problems for child&hyphen;care centres is the poor planning of the previous government whereby child&hyphen;care centres grew willy&hyphen;nilly and in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4956"> competition with each other and whereby they were not viable because of lack of children or because of people's changing circumstances in their communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday Senator O'Brien asked me a question. I gave him an answer based on the information I have from the minister responsible. It is, perhaps, a pity I did not give him more information than I did. Perhaps I could give it to him now, if I have got the time. I referred yesterday to the small amount of information available to the department from the report commissioned to enable the Ravenswood Child Care Centre to be viable. Senator, that report showed there were four possible scenarios for the continued operation of the centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In three of these options it is assumed that the service will cease to receive an operational subsidy. Each of these scenarios&mdash;for example, no longer providing hot meals&mdash;show the service remaining viable. If the provision of meals was to cease&mdash;if families brought their own meals, as they do in  many child&hyphen;care centres&mdash;there would not be a need to increase the fees. It is a great shame that the management has not been prepared to adopt any of the options which they themselves proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party might be interested to know, too, that this child&hyphen;care centre received funding of $77,000&hyphen;odd for capital upgrading in November 1995 from their government. Then it received a management restructuring grant of $57,281 in December 1995. Since we came into government the centre has received additional amounts for fencing and replacement of glass panels to the tune of nearly $5,000. This is a child&hyphen;care centre which is receiving about $90,000 in child&hyphen;care assistance as well as the $23,000 operational subsidy. We are here with money to assist them to restructure. If they are not willing to be viable and efficient, then I am afraid what will happen is that somebody else will look to run the child&hyphen;care centre in their place. That is what is happening in Launceston now. Another organisation is looking to see whether they will take it over. The situation in regard to the other child&hyphen;care centres that you

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Watson for that question, because Labor did indeed leave us with a terrible unemployment legacy&mdash;an unemployment rate over 10 per cent for 33 consecutive months and the creation of a mere 33,500 jobs over almost a six&hyphen;year period. That is a tragedy in anyone's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> terms. As a result we have introduced a comprehensive array of policies which are designed to address this very important issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bringing the budget into surplus, providing a climate for lower interest rates, getting rid of Labor's job destroying unfair dismissal laws, providing a more flexible labour market to increase productivity and competitiveness, rollover relief, provisional tax uplift factor, reducing red tape and providing access to venture capital are all initiatives designed to ensure that small business is able to act as a jobs generator. We are also committed to removing the financial incentives on young people to go on to unemployment benefits and to re&hyphen;invigorate the apprenticeship and traineeship scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also asked whether there are any groups beyond the government's capacity to provide meaningful assistance. Unfortunately, the answer is yes. We know that because of a devastating admission made by Senator Conroy in giving evidence before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. Senator Conroy identified what he described as a mini&hyphen; unemployment crisis. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A lot of people, because they have been particularly a Labor member of parliament, are just incapable of getting a job, particularly in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have looked at what we can do for them. There are some labour market programs. None of them seem to be particularly appropriate. Often you need to have some degree of business acumen. Clearly, you would not qualify under the NIES scheme. There aren't employers who are prepared to take on people who have generally spent a lifetime bagging the private sector and showing no interest at all in the concerns of businesses struggling to make ends meet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also thought of some political education programs to try and explain to them what the capitalist system is all about, how private enterprise can actually create markets and jobs, how choice and incentive are very important aspects. Indeed, the dead hand of Labor governments is something we would very much warn them against. You only have to ask yourself: who would give Kim Carr a job? Most people wouldn't feed him. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4959"> reason they wouldn't feed him is that he has never done anything other than be critical of all the private sector stands for. But if someone like Stephen Loosley can get a job, you would have thought there would be a bit of hope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can only say that we sympathise very much with Senator Conroy's concerns. His solution is yet another retirement village adjustment pay&hyphen;out. What they want is yet another government payment to try and smooth the transition from a trade union sponsored position. What we have got here, as you will notice, Madam President, is a delegates meeting, is it not? Or is it just the organisers having a bit of a chat? It is probably a meeting of the sandpit club, where the only qualifications are that you are not interested in public policy, you simply bury your head in the sand every time anyone comes up with any sensible ideas for actual job creation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I can say is that Senator Conroy and his colleagues have our greatest sympathy. If they really do want to get jobs in the private sector, they will have to make a much better effort to try and understand the problems, to try and ensure that there are opportunities available. They will not be able to go back to the trade union movement because they are already trying to train a new phalanx of seat warmers to come through the system. So clearly they would not want to take this lot back again. I think the future is pretty bleak for most of those opposite&mdash;two-thirds of whom do have that background.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I must say that, even in all the circumstances that we have had to date and the responses of Senator Newman in relation to the issue of child care, I was still somewhat surprised to hear the response given by her yesterday. Despite her denials and despite her attempts to mislead the Senate, I will repeat for the information of senators what Senator Newman said yesterday in response to Senator O'Brien's question, and this is recorded in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have no view on centres being closed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This clearly indicates the indifference and callousness of this government, and in particular Senator Newman, in relation to the effect that their policies have been having on child-care centres and, further, the effect that will have on the children who are being cared for in those centres and the parents that rely  on those child-care centres so they can go to work and carry out their usual other activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has taken a large number of steps since it got into government which have all had a negative effect on child care. Last year in its budget, it cut $500 million from child care and added insult to that injury by again cutting $321 million in the 1997 budget. There may be some people in the coalition who think that is a good thing, but it is certainly not a view that I share and it is not a view that is shared by the vast number of parents in this community. Parents think that having a workable, well set&hyphen;up, high quality child-care sector is a good thing for them and a good thing for their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The steps that this government has taken and the callousness that Senator Newman has betrayed are negative things. Parents will end up with a lower quality child-care sector that has higher costs. That is already starting to come about. A lot of the cuts that were put in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> place in the 1996 budget are, in fact, not yet having an effect. The cuts to child-care assistance will not have effect until 1 July. But already prices have risen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my discussions with child-care centres, because of the cuts to child-care assistance, there will either be a further increase of up to $20 a week or, alternatively, they will have to impose cuts. This will mean that children do not get the same level of service they are getting now; they will get a lower quality level of child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sorts of cuts are they entertaining&mdash;not out of the wish to reduce their quality of service, but because of the necessity as a result of decisions made by this government? They will have to reduce the number of staff, which means that the quality of care and training provided to these kids is compromised, as also is their safety. It means that they may not be able to provide meals during the middle of the day. It means a lower number of resources with things such as toys, and with facilities generally. It may mean that they will not be able to provide the playground equipment that they had planned to provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that it is a little worrying to me that the minister in this government who is in charge of providing child care does not seem to understand how the vast number of community based child-care centres operate. She assumes that there is some overwhelming conflict between members of the management committee and parents at the centre. She fails to understand or appreciate that, with the vast range of community based child-care centres, the members of the management committee are parents at the centre, and that the parents and the management are entirely in accord. That is, that they wish to provide the best quality child care they can while, at the same time, keeping costs at a reasonable level so that parents can actually afford to send their children there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is some of the anecdotal evidence that is coming across already: that parents who previously had children in child care are no longer able to afford to send them there. They are withdrawing them from care or they are

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought I might respond to this particular matter because it is a matter that is in my own state and, although I come from the south of Tasmania, I am interested in child care. In fact, I had much pleasure today in putting out a press release in Tasmania, announcing that the federal government is making money available for an additional 215 child-care places around Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, here we have today Senator O'Brien and Senator Neal attacking Senator Newman and, through her, the Minister for Family Services, Mrs Judy Moylan, about the lack of care that this government is showing with child-care centres. In fact, I think it is fair to say that, in the last year of the Keating government, $1.003 billion was spent on child care; whereas, last year, the first year of the Howard government, our government, we spent $1.102 billion. That is an increase of over $100 million, or 10 per cent, on the amount spent by the previous government. That is a fact, and you cannot get away from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My press release, entitled `Tasmanian child care gets a big boost', states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following organisations will receive additional places&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and this is in Tasmania&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clarence City Council, Hobart City Council, Hobart Police &amp; Citizens Youth Club, Lady Gowrie Tasmania, Lansdowne Crescent Primary School, Lipscombe Child Care Centre&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which is run by a very good friend of mine, Monica Dowd, who plays a leading role in child care in Tasmania; she represents Tasmanian child care on the federal body, and her concerns have been made known to Senator Newman on more than one occasion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">St Michael's Collegiate School, Taroona Primary Parents &amp; Friends Association, Waratah-Wynyard Council, Sacred Heart College and Nixon Street Primary School Parents &amp; Friends Association.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, something like $142,000, plus another $39,000 in a one-off, will be spent in creating 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> new year-round care places. That is the record of this government which has been announced just today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So now Senator O'Brien comes in here and starts to talk about the Ravenswood matter. I saw the TV over the weekend, and I thought, `Gosh, what's going on up here?' It was supposed to be a meeting, I think you said yesterday; it looked to me more like a demonstration. Then I managed to get a copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS>. I had a look at that, and guess what? The federal ALP candidate for Bass, Michelle O'Byrne, had been addressing the rally. So, here we have it. Obviously, what we have here is a politically motivated attempt to try to upset the applecart in Bass. It is quite obvious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, Warwick Smith, is working very hard to ensure that parents in the Ravenswood area continue to have a service. But the fact is&mdash;and you cannot get away from this&mdash;that the decision to recommend the closure of that particular centre was made by the committee of management prior to the submission to the department by financial report without any discussion with the department. So, in other words, they decided themselves that they were in financial difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter has been taken up, as I said, by Warwick Smith, who is having discussions with the Launceston City Mission. I understand that, over the last two weeks, he has initiated and coordinated discussions with organisations around Launceston who are interested in taking over the operation of the Ravenswood Children's Playhouse child&hyphen;care centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand Senator O'Brien's concern; that is his patch. But, as I have said, it is interesting to notice that one of the leading lights pushing the demonstration, the rally of the 100 placard waving residents, is none other than the nominated federal ALP candidate for Bass.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we should get back to the facts. The facts are that, since coming to government, we have increased child-care funding by 10 per cent. Over the next four years, the Howard government will spend $4.8 billion, and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4966"> child care will continue to grow at three per cent real growth in each of the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the fact that we have decreased inflation to such a low level, that is over and above the level of inflation. So it is important to note that this government, since coming to office, has created over 31,000 new child-care places in a full year, at around a cost of $86 million. So there you go: you hear one story, and here is the real story. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The trouble that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) has is that yesterday she expressed herself in a way that can only really have one meaning, unless you accept what the minister says, which is that you need a legal interpretation to get the meaning that was intended. The minister said that she is relying on her legal training to advise us that she did not mean what the words say. What we have to do with this minister's answers apparently is trot them out and get legal advice so we know what they mean.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the words Senator Neal said are what the minister said in that sentence. The minister says, `We can qualify it by what follows,' and she is entitled to argue that. But I think she has to admit that she has got herself into trouble with, at best, a very imprecise answer. Today it got worse. In my  question I referred to industry sources. The minister then said, `There's your problem. You are referring to industry sources.' Without quoting her, she said that they are not reliable, that they have a motive in this so you cannot quote them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Tasmania the industry is mostly comprised of the community sector&mdash;that is, child-care centres that are run by voluntary community citizens in committees of management. These people volunteer their services. They do not get paid. They could be lawyers, accountants or any sort of people in the community. They go along and they make the decisions to run the industry in the main in Tasmania. That is the industry that we are quoting, and the industry has bagged them. These sorts of committees are not prepared to do what the department says, which is to trade 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> until they are insolvent. That is the sort of measure this government is putting to these community sector organisations&mdash;trade on until you are insolvent, and then you will have to close the centre and we will get someone else to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason they are not prepared to do that is that they could well be personally liable for any emerging obligations of that centre, be they employee obligations or otherwise. That is an irresponsible thing that this government is putting to these people. For the minister, in responding to my question, to attack the industry in her state that she should know about&mdash;the industry that Senator Calvert refers to as being one that will expand when the community sector people who run the industry in Tasmania say that centres are going to close&mdash;is incredible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that Mrs Dowd, who Senator Calvert referred to, is a very staunch worker for the industry. She is probably a supporter of his party rather than mine. But I know that she is very critical of this government's position in relation to child care and the cuts to funding and pressures that have been place placed on the child-care industry in Tasmania. Why should the community sector in Tasmania or any child care centre be confident about their future? It is easy to make announcements that somehow there is going to be an expansion in the number of places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Calvert referred to local government centres in his answer. I know that it is extremely likely&mdash;in fact, I am prepared to suggest it is more than likely&mdash;that local government sponsored centres in Tasmania will close. There will be a rationalisation of local government centres run by the Glenorchy council, which is in the south of the state, your area. The Clarence council will look very carefully at the two centres it runs on the eastern shore in Hobart, your area. The question of opening more centres will probably not be one of opening centres or full day care places but after school care places. I suspect that is the sort of announcement that you are talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Long day care places for working parents and for parents with respite care needs are not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4967"> being attended to by this government. They are not being attended to by the funding measures that are coming out of this budget. What we are seeing reflected in the circumstances with the closure of the Ravenswood centre is parents who have a need for child care who are losing it because the committees of management who run them are responsible enough to know that they cannot continue because they cannot charge the sorts of fees that the people who use their centres can afford to pay. Why? Because of your government's policies in relation to funding. That is the problem that they have. Your government has not addressed it. Minister Newman has to take it back to Minister Moylan and do something about it, because you have not done that to date. You have made it worse.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important to read the whole of Senator Newman's answer yesterday rather than the Labor Party's spin that they have put on this. Their attitude is, `Don't let the truth get in the way of our story.' They have failed to say exactly what Senator Newman said. When discussing the Ravenswood Children's Playhouse Child Care Centre in Launceston, she said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I utterly reject the suggestion that I misled the Senate in any shape or form because neither in relation to this child-care centre to which you are referring, Senator&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and she was referring to Senator O'Brien&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">nor in relation to any other has this government targeted centres for closure. We have no view on centres being closed. In fact, to the opposite: we have put money into supporting them to be restructured so they can survive. So get your facts straight. Let me make it clear that I have advice here from the minister which I am now prepared to give you.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In that whole context she was saying that the government had not targeted centres for closure and they had no view about centres being closed&mdash;and she meant centres targeted for closure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the heat of giving answers to questions, sometimes the language does not come out quite perfectly. I want to give an example&mdash;I will not say who it is from, but they will recognise it when they hear it&mdash;of a minister 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> answering a question from Senator Troeth. This minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When opposition members come into this place and want to argue about policies then I will be very much prepared to take up the issue, but we have no campaign at all about policies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the slip of language that sometimes occurs. Do we run around saying that this senator did not have a campaign about policies? No, because that is the way the language runs when you say it rather than when you write it. When you say it, you have to see it in the whole context. Here we have a minister who got up and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When opposition members come into this place and want to argue about policies then I will be very much prepared to take up the issue, but we have no campaign at all about policies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am not going to say who that minister was, but that minister constantly used verbal fruit salad in answers. There was a struggle to get it out, and it sometimes came out not as clearly as it might otherwise have been if the person had written it. That is what the minister did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have Senator O'Brien and Senator Neal with selective attention taking up one sentence, and that is absolutely unfair. I think any person listening to this broadcast today would agree about taking a sentence out of context like that. Then to say that Senator Newman said she had to be a lawyer to interpret it, what she was saying was that as a lawyer you look at the whole thing. I am not a lawyer, but my view is that you look at the whole of what the senator said and then get it into context. What she was saying was that they had not targeted any centres for closure. They had no view about targeting centres. This whole question was based on that premise. I think it was outrageous and totally inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Calvert has outlined what has happened. I have been advised that the centre commissioned a report on its viability&mdash;the department apparently has an extract from that&mdash;which indicated that with some very minor administrative changes the centre would remain viable. Senator O'Brien comes in here and says, `The world is going to fall in; they are going to be liable if it goes to the wall.' 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4968"> They have been advised by their own report that they commissioned that with some very small changes they could be viable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Newman pointed out that that centre has had major works funding of $111,863, capital upgrading of $77,365, major restructuring grants of $57,281, $2,285 for fencing, and $2,000 for the replacement of glass panels, and it currently receives recurrent funding of about $23,500 in operational subsidy and about $90,000 in child&hyphen;care assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report that they got on the basis of what they have and what they have been given is that with some minor changes they could be viable. That is the report commissioned by the management committee itself. The reckless approach to child-care policy that Labor had resulted in an unplanned and poorly distributed child&hyphen;care system. That is being eliminated by this government. We are putting in place a system which makes them viable and workable and which focuses on retargeting benefits to low and middle income families and encourages centres to reassess their charging practices. All centres have been given funding assistance to look at the administrative changes that need to take place to make them viable. They were offered that. They have been told in their own report that they could be viable if they addressed some minor changes to their administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator O'Brien, to come in here and misquote the senator does you no service. Senator Neal, it does you no service at all to quote the minister without quoting her in the entirety. Go back and have a look at some of your own ministers' answers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will be very important for Minister Newman to have a look at what she said today because she actually said that this child&hyphen;care centre was closing because it was part of the previous Labor government's unplanned child&hyphen;care program. You will note, particularly if you were watching at the time that she said that, that she promptly drew in her breath and did not repeat it, because she knows it is absolutely wrong&mdash;just as Senator 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Patterson was skating very close to deliberate falsehood when she said that the Labor government was hopeless with child care because it was not planned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centres we are talking about are all community based centres and every one of them has been planned. They have all been placed in situations where the government's studies have shown a high need for child&hyphen;care places, family assistance and families' need for work. In fact, the private centres were disdainful of any of that information and data. As part of that planning process, in my time as minister I made that data available to the private centres so that they could also put their child&hyphen;care centres where they would most assist them. By and large they did not act on that and I will be very pleased to see how this government intends to require private child-care centres to open in a planned way. If they do not, of course, they will not be eligible for child&hyphen;care assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have here a minister who got it wrong today. She said that the Ravenswood child&hyphen;care centre is not built according to the planned process that the incoming coalition government wants to introduce. The senator is absolutely wrong on that. It was opened according to planning. I do not know the full details of Ravenswood, at least of the last little while, so I hesitate before I make this comment. But I would like to know why that committee of management, which has a fair idea of the people who live around it&mdash;a very poor area as I understand&mdash;thought that asking families to bring their own meals for the children was not something they wanted to proceed with. It might have to do with what that committee of management know about the poverty of the families around that centre. It was not a centre, as I understand it, that was largely devoted to working families, but it was a centre designed in large part to assist parents with occasional care or non&hyphen;work related care. It was also a centre in a poorer socioeconomic area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister Newman says that the government has funds to assist those centres&mdash;yes, $3,000 to assist the management with restructuring. But this is after you have taken at least $23,500, on Senator Patterson's figures, out 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4969"> of that centre: $3,000 in to do nothing except to restructure and $23,000&hyphen;plus out, which was assisting with the recurrent costs of that centre. It seems to me a very bizarre equation if Senator Newman wants to say that that is the way we should think about it&mdash;`You should not look at the cuts. We are, after all, assisting these people.' If you take $23,000 away and give $3,000 back, most people understand what that means. It is a massive cut of the operational subsidy from this centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own state six community based child&hyphen;care centres have now closed. I am advised that in Western Australia it is 10, and they are all community based centres, very often in the lower socioeconomic areas where no private centre would open. It will be interesting to see if private operators will come in and take over these centres or not. There is also supposed to be money to assist families and provide child care in lower socioeconomic areas. I would like to see why that is not forthcoming to some of these centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would you want to shift the committee of management, which knows full well about the community there? Why is it not helping restructure and keep these child&hyphen;care centres open instead of being disdainful or disregarding as they close? Senator Calvert, you should check what child&hyphen;care places you are announcing today. I am sure they are outside school hours care. At least some of them that you announced were attached to schools, so that makes me suspicious that they are outside school hours care places. I welcome those. We welcome all of them. There is more need for child&hyphen;care centres and there is certainly no need to be closing places&mdash;and closing them with the disdain that Senator Newman brought into this place. That is no help at all. As for saying that families are not the regard of the Labor Party&mdash;oh, yes, they are. What are the women and representatives of the coalition who are supposed to speak for families doing when they disregard the needs of thousands of families who need child care? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particularly with regard to some of the points raised by Senator Crowley. We all know that in the ebb and flow of commercial activity, some commercial activity remains on an ongoing basis and some does not. The reasons for the ebb and flow of commercial activity are many and varied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that this particular child&hyphen;care centre, as I understand it, has been given opportunities to change the way in which it operates, and foremost among these is a management restructuring grant which, as I understand it, was for $57,281. That was given to the centre in December 1995. I am sure that the centre employed that money in the best possible way but you would think that, in the 18 months it had been given to restructure its activities, somewhat better use would have been made of the $57,000 to enable it not to close as it has just announced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I gather, from material which has been passed on to me by the minister, that the decision to recommend the closure of the centre was made by the committee of management prior to the submission of the financial report to the department, and was taken without discussion with either the minister's office or the department of the options in that report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason, of course, that the child&hyphen;care centre did not get the disadvantaged area subsidy is that this subsidy is provided to services located in areas where no other child care is available&mdash;in areas such as rural areas. Presumably, there are other child&hyphen;care centres available, and parents in the Ravenswood area will be able to take advantage of those. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government would very much like to encompass the provision of private child&hyphen;care centres and, although there may have been many community based child&hyphen;care centres in this area, in other areas of Tasmania, and indeed in other states, it is important to recognise that the expansion of private sector child care on an equitable footing with community care centres was something that was envisaged by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision of operational subsidies to all community centres represented a significant inequity which saw 70 per cent of families unable to benefit from that subsidy and, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4970"> indeed, parents in some rural and remote areas could not fund child&hyphen;care centres at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already remarked on the totally unplanned nature of the Labor government's child care expansion. This was highlighted in questions that I asked of officers of the department in Senate community affairs committee estimates hearings during our time in opposition. It was very obvious that there was little or no planning policy in place. This meant that we had oversupply in some areas and undersupply in others, which threatened the viability of the entire sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to point out that the closure of centres is nothing new. Under the Labor government in 1995&hyphen;96, 21 centres closed and a further 16 centres had to be propped up through additional government assistance.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Practices Act, a hole that must be filled if small business in this country is to properly flourish in a genuinely fair and competitive economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For two decades, small businesses have been lobbying for legislative protection against unfair trading conduct by companies with undue market power, and for two decades various successive governments have allowed misuse of market power against small business to continue unchecked. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4977"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The situation has now reached crisis point in many industry sectors. That crisis is most acutely evident in the commercial relationships between shopping centre tenants and their landlords. But it is also a major issue in the oil industry in dealings between oil companies and their franchised service station operators, in the multi&hyphen;billion dollar franchising industry generally, in the banking sector and between exclusive suppliers and their customers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to the most recent Yellow Pages index of small business sentiment, competition and big business issues were the fourth biggest concerns of small business behind lack of sales, and almost level pegging with cash flow and consumer confidence. It ranked well ahead of government regulations, rising costs, staffing issues, taxes and bank lending. Small business organisations such as the Council of Small Business Organisations, the Motor Trades Association and the Pharmacy Guild have listed reform of fair trading laws as the biggest concern facing small business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 10,000 strong Australian Retailers Association has described retail tenancy laws, an aspect of fair trading, as `the single most important matter facing speciality retailers and impacting adversely their profitability.' With occupancy costs now often exceeding labour costs for Australian retailers, the association argues that the benefits of freeing up the tenancy market will far exceed the benefits of freeing up the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For many years, the Democrats have strongly supported the call for strengthening the legal protections available to small business against unfair trading practices. In June 1995, the Democrats sought to amend the Trade Practices Act to insert a new section 51AA to ban the use of economic duress in trade and commerce, to allow access to civil as well as criminal damages for breach of the unconscionable conduct provisions and to allow the ACCC to undertake representative actions. Speaking to the amendments, Senator Sid Spindler said the amendments were necessary because small business had not been able to access unconscionable conduct as a remedy because of the way the provisions were then drafted in the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ALP government at the time refused to support the Democrats' amendments, but introduced a somewhat narrower better business conduct bill four months later to deal with the issue. The late introduction of this bill saw it lapse without consideration with the calling of the 1996 election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition has been much slower in coming to terms with the issue, despite their professed support for the small business sector. Its election policy promised to `monitor' the issues, to `review' case studies and reports, to `educate' small business proprietors, to implement self&hyphen;regulatory industry codes of practice and alternative dispute resolution schemes, and to `consider . . . . if appropriate, amendments to the Trade Practices Act to complement the effectiveness of Codes of Practice and education programs'. However, the policy clearly fell 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> short of the expectations of the small business community. To ameliorate concerns of the sector, the coalition also promised to refer the issue to a parliamentary committee to allow all views to be considered. In complying with this commitment, Minister Prosser referred the matter to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. That committee produced its report&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance&mdash;towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS>  last month.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee received 198 submissions from small businesses, governments and industry bodies, and took evidence from 70 individuals and organisations. Half of its submissions were primarily on the vexed issue of retail tenancies. The committee concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After detailed investigation the committee has concluded that concerns about unfair business conduct towards small business are justified, and should be addressed urgently. In an endeavour to find a balance towards fair trading in Australia, the committee has recommended a number of specific measures, including legislation, to induce behavioural change on the part of big business towards smaller business and to provide unfairly treated small businesses with adequate means of redress. These proposals will provide small businesses with a fair deal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill implements the unanimous recommendations of the 10 coalition and five Labor members of the committee. The evidence gathered by the committee presents a compelling case for reform, a case put repeatedly by small business organisations over two decades.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unanimous recommendations are all the more startling because they clearly run counter to the broad approach of the government's policy preference for self&hyphen;regulation. This was summed up by the Minister for Small Business, the Hon. Geoff Prosser, in a speech to the Property Council of Australia on  25 October 1996. Speaking about retail tenants' concerns about current retail tenancy contracts, the minister concluded:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of these complaints are either unfounded or at least one sided. It is the government's view that landlords should be free to exercise their property rights in all but the most exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the speech, the minister also outlined his expectations of the committee's report:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am seeking strategies that are in keeping with the government's commitment to minimum effective regulation. The strategies should take into account our preferences for solutions that do not involve legislation. In other words, they will need to take into account the application of  voluntary codes of conduct and associated industry self&hyphen;regulation strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the government's clear preference for voluntary self&hyphen;regulation, the committee's recommendations are all the more remarkable. The committee concluded that voluntary codes of practice simply are not effective, as the collapse of the Franchising Code Council amply demonstrates. The committee has concluded that there is a place for codes of practice, but that these need to be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4978"> made mandatory by being underpinned by the Trade Practices Act. This is a view that the Democrats have long held.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I said, the bill implements, in full, the recommendations of the committee in relation to legislative changes to the Trade Practices Act. It should be emphasised that, in doing so, it is only the start of the process of achieving fair trading rules. This bill will ensure that industries have a major incentive to develop codes of practice, while giving the ACCC a strong oversight role in approving codes of practice. With small business and the ACCC working hand in hand, these legislative changes are the first important step in establishing, sector by sector, what commercial behaviour is acceptable and unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now outline the details of the bill itself. Item (1) of Schedule 1 inserts a new clause 51AA into the Trade Practices Act. This replaces the current largely ineffective provisions dealing with unconscionable conduct with a new broader provision on unfair conduct. Subsection (1) prohibits a corporation, in trade or commerce, from engaging in conduct that is, in all the circumstances, unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsection (2) lists, without limiting the matters which the court may have regard to, a number of matters the court may have regard in determining whether the conduct is unfair. These matters encompass the relative bargaining power of the parties, the conduct and intentions of the parties, the nature of the contract and the good faith of the parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A particularly important provision is subsection 51(AA)(2)(i) regarding the requirements of any code of practice applying to participants in the area of trade or commerce in which the corporation is involved and which has been approved by the ACCC. It would be expected that industry specific codes of practice would cover issues such as pre&hyphen;contractual and continuous disclosure, contractual terms, the clear obligations of both parties, dispute resolution, any variations in costs and charges and so on, as are relevant for the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some critics of unfair trading laws, particularly large corporations and their representatives, have argued that enacting a new section 51AA will increase contractual uncertainty. The Democrats do not share this view&mdash;a view also rejected by the committee. As codes of practice are developed by the relevant parties, clear standards of what is fair business conduct will be established. Indeed, the process of developing a code of conduct can be as important as the final document itself as it forces an industry to consider what practices are fair and unfair. This will lead to greater certainty of contracting, and will avoid many of the disputes over unclear contractual terms, particularly where terms are open ended and one party is able to exercise dominant market power over another.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subclause (3) provides that a corporation does not engage in unfair conduct by reason only that it institutes legal proceeding or refers a dispute or claim to arbitration. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subclause (4) further limits the clause by stating that the court shall not have regard to circumstances which were not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the alleged contravention, but may have regard to circumstances existing prior to the commencement of the section.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subclauses (5) and (6) make it clear that a court cannot make an order in respect of a contravention of the section unless the parties have first attended a mediation conference. The court will have regard to the good faith of the parties at that mediation conference in assessing costs in relation to the action. These sub&hyphen;clauses fulfil the recommendations of the committee that the provisions should be subject to compulsory arbitration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Item (2) gives the ACCC the power to approve codes of practice, provided it is satisfied that associated corporations in a field of trade or commerce have agreed to be bound by a code of practice for fair dealing, and that organisations representing other interested persons have been consulted. The power in section 51ABA is discretionary&mdash;the ACCC need not approve the code if, for example, the code does not establish fair dealing practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Items (3) and (4) amend section 76 to ensure that civil as well as criminal penalties are available for breaches of section 51AA or of the consumer protection provisions of Division 1 and Division 1A of Part V of the act. These amendments were accepted by the committee on the advice of the ACCC as a means of providing a wider choice of remedies depending on the nature of the breach. Under the proposal, if a person contravened Part IVA or these provisions of Part V, he or she would be liable for a civil penalty. If, however, the conduct was engaged in knowingly, intentionally or recklessly and with an intention to cause significant loss or detriment to another or with knowledge of the likelihood of causing such loss or damage, the person would be liable to a criminal prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Item (5) seeks to make it clear that an action for damages for loss is clearly available in section 82 for breaches of the unconscionable conduct provisions in Part IVA. I am particularly pleased that this provision was picked up by the committee, as it was a matter Senator Spindler drew attention to with his amendments in June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Item (6) amends section 87 to make it clear that the ACCC is able to take representative actions for breaches of the competition provisions of the act&mdash;Part IV&mdash;as well as the unconscionable conduct and unfair trading provisions&mdash;Parts IVA and V. This extension of the ACCC's capacity to take representative actions on behalf of small business is important to ensure that small businesses have an effective means of redress to end unlawful behaviour. This amendment was also sought by Senator Spindler in 1995, and again I am pleased that it has been picked up by the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, this bill widens protections for small business against unfair trading practices in the Trade Practices Act, and also widens the choice of remedies 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4979"> available to the parties and the ACCC for breaches. The bill follows exactly the unanimous recommendations of the fair trading committee report. In doing so, it is hoped the bill will have broad cross&hyphen;party support to address issues the committee correctly identified as needing urgent attention. The protections are absolutely essential for small business to be able to operate in conditions of fair and genuine competition. I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUSTRALIA'S AIR LINKS WITH LATIN AMERICA</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE SENATE FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DEFENCE AND TRADE REFERENCES COMMITTEE.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 30 November 1995, the Senate referred the 1994&hyphen;95 Annual Reports of the Department of Transport and Qantas Airways Limited to the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to review the development of Australia's air links with Latin America.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee received a total of 19 submissions from relevant government departments and agencies, the private sector, and other interested parties. Public hearings were held on 11 and 17 June 1996 in Canberra. Evidence was heard from the Department of Transport and Regional Development, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Tourist Commission, members of the Latin American Heads of Mission in Canberra, Aerolineas Argentinas and Qantas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee's report containing 11 recommendations was presented to the President of the Senate in July 1996. The recommendations encourage the continued development of air links with Latin America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government policy is committed to liberalisation of international aviation, but stops short of pursuing a policy of open skies. The policy of liberalisation has already seen expansive outcomes in the negotiation of Australia's bilateral air services agreements since the government took office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Latin America as a region can present significant future opportunities for increased business activity, tourism and investment. Australia has bilateral air services agreements with both Chile and Argentina and has exchanged draft agreements with Brazil as a basis for further discussions on the establishment of direct air links. To fully explore its potential, appropriately focused strategies across a number of portfolios are needed to remove obstacles to potential growth while recognising the essentially embryonic nature of Australia's relations with the region. Improved air links is but one of a number of factors 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> necessary for growth; indeed, it would be irrational to expect that simply operating additional air services in the absence of commercially sustainable levels of demand is a course which government policy does, or ought, encourage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Air services between Australia and South America continue to be characterised by very low levels of demand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Experience of current demand suggests that sustained direct air services are fragile and unlikely to be able to sustain competitive entry without further growth in passenger and freight levels. The most efficient way to promote and develop this market, certainly through its developmental stage, may be through allowing airlines to develop cooperative commercial arrangements using off&hyphen;shore collection and distribution points.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government supports the development of hubbing operations and has encouraged commercial agreements such as code sharing between Australian and Latin American carriers as an appropriate means of developing these markets and providing potential consumers with a range of services to the South American Continent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Air services arrangements with Argentina and Chile were expanded in 1996 to provide carriers with further opportunities to promote and develop the Australia&mdash;Latin American market. The new arrangements provide airlines, including Aerolineas Argentinas and Lan Chile, with the opportunity to facilitate and develop air links.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The preparation of the government's response to the report has involved consultation with relevant  government departments and agencies and the Australian carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade welcomes the positive outcome of the latest air services negotiations with Argentina and Chile. These new arrangements provide carriers with enhanced opportunities to develop the route, encourage more frequent services as well as underpin the commercial viability of the route. These developments will be a positive factor in broad efforts to further build strong trade, investment and political linkages between Australia and Latin America.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 1</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that the Australian Government recognise that the opportunities for increasing business activity and investment in Latin America are very significant and that every effort should be made to remove obstacles to potential growth. Further, the committee recommends that the government accept the view put forward by a variety of interests that inadequate air links are a major impediment to growth and believes that more frequent services would be a significant means of stimulating further commercial activity between Australia and Latin America.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government supports this recommendation while recognising that in the presence of a liberal regulatory environment the number of air services on the route will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4981"> reflect the commercial decision of airlines based primarily on the level of demand. Growth in the promotion of trade and tourism links should increase the level of demand for commercially viable air services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While growth in trade and tourism links should increase the demand for air services, it is recognised that air services are important to the expansion of trade and investment links and that the availability of more frequent and direct services could generate potentially significant trade, investment and tourism benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revised capacity and commercial opportunities negotiated by this government with Argentina and Chile provide for current and expected future levels of demand for travel between Australia and the Latin American region at the same time as continuing to provide opportunities for as many airlines as possible to enter and operate in the market. The government will not `pick winners' amongst the South American carriers; and Australian carriers have the right to expect that their commercial strategies will get at least as fair an opportunity to succeed as foreign carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The developing nature of the route is reflected in the fact that none of the carriers participating in this market operates direct services in its own right. Aerolineas Argentinas, Lan Chile, Air New Zealand, Ansett, Qantas and carriers operating via the United States (16% of the total traffic) terminate their services at intermediate points and extend their reach to South America or Australia on a joint service basis. As the market strengthens, provision has been made within the current arrangements for carriers to operate direct services in their own right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 2</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that the Australian Government recognise that the potential for tourist visits to Australia from Latin America will only be realised if air services on the route are significantly improved; whereas travel between Latin America and Australia is currently not a sufficiently attractive option.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government recognises that the level of air services is an important factor in the development of international tourism between Latin America and Australia. Since coming into office, the government has negotiated significantly expanded air services arrangements with Argentina and Chile and has commenced air services negotiations with Brazil.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other factors, such as the economic conditions in Latin America, the level of promotion of Australia in the region, the relative price competitiveness of Australia as a tourism destination and historical and cultural ties also play an important role in determining tourism flows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although Australia has limited control over factors such as the economic conditions in source countries and historical and cultural ties, increased tourism promotion by Australia in the region can have a significant positive impact on inbound tourism. It is important, however, that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the limited promotional funds be used in the way that maximises the returns to Australia. This will require, among other things, a close coordination between promotional activity and the level of airline services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government welcomes advice that the Australian Tourist Commission has recently completed its second South American Travel Mission conducted in Brazil, Argentina and Chile. Thirteen Australian companies attended the Mission as well as representatives from the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation (QTTC), Tourism Victoria and the Northern Territory Tourist Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 3</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that the Australian Government recognise that greater frequency of air services would stimulate air freight, which could improve profitability and lead to cheaper passenger fares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While accepting that air freight can make a positive contribution to the profitability of airlines, a correlation between increased air freight activity and improved airline profitability leading to lower air fares with a subsequent increase in passenger demand in this particular market has not been demonstrated and is structurally very unlikely. Around the world, and even in Australia, passengers subsidise freight, rather than freight support passengers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently there is no shortage of freight capacity for exports. Freight load factors year round average in the 70% range with rates available to exporters of perishable products already at extremely low levels. Frequency of airline service can generally only stimulate the carriage of air freight in mature markets when the demand for goods at the buyer's end of the route is greater than the supply of capacity and the yield available from export freight rates are high enough to cover the freight operating costs. These circumstances do not yet exist in the Australia&mdash;Latin America air freight market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 4</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that the Australian Government recognise the potential for Australia to become a regional hub for the increasing Latin America&hyphen;Asia traffic, and the possible significant economic benefits to be gained from establishing itself as such. Everything should be done to facilitate the development of the concept and that the relevant parties should explore the possibilities for developing smooth traffic flows Latin America&hyphen;Australia&hyphen;Asia, either by granting beyond rights to the existing Latin American carriers through code sharing with Australian carriers, or through another means.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is prepared to support the development of hubbing operations in Australia for Latin America&hyphen;Asia traffic once the potential economic benefits of such operations are demonstrated. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4982"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia already operates as a regional hub for traffic between Latin America and South East Asia albeit at very low levels of demand (approximately 3,500 passengers in 1995). The greater flow of passengers will continue to be carried over North Asian routes via the United States to Latin American destinations, given powerful commercial and historical factors supporting US hubs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no impediment to the development of Australia as a hub for Asia&mdash;Latin America traffic. Currently over 30 international airlines operate into Asia from Australia with over 450 services per week. There is an open capacity regime on the trans Tasman route and very liberal arrangements have been developed by New Zealand with a number of South American countries and are complemented by arrangements agreed between Australia and Argentina and Chile. There is no impediment to South American carriers entering into commercial cooperation arrangements on an interline basis via Australia to Asia with any airline of their choice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 5</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that the Australian Government recognise that competition in the market is desirable and an important element in the improvement of quality of service and in the reduction of fares. It also recommends that the government recognise that where an operator has been willing to demonstrate its commitment to a market and to take commercial risks over an extended period, especially where its is offering a service that is in Australia's national interest, it should be encouraged to develop that service further. Increased demand for services will provide opportunities for all carriers willing to commit resources to the market. It is the responsibility of individual carriers to make commercial decisions as to whether, and to what extent, they wish to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports the principles expressed in developing this recommendation. A central element of the government's aviation policy is to actively encourage and promote improvements in competition, quality of service and the reduction of air fares. This is reflected in the negotiating strategies employed in all of our major international markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government acknowledges the Latin American carriers' contribution to the development of this market. The arrangements reached with Chile and Argentina will enable their carriers to expand services significantly on the route.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 6</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that at future negotiations with Argentine and Chilean aviation authorities Aerolineas Argentinas and Lan Chile be granted the right to increase the frequency of their services, as they see the need, up to daily flights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has commenced implementing a strategy consistent with the recommendation. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The negotiations held with Argentina in August 1996 allow Aerolineas Argentinas to operate the equivalent of daily B747 services on a code share basis with an Australian carrier to up to five destination points in Australia. The carrier also has access to the entire Australian domestic network behind these gateways on a code shared basis with an Australian carrier.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangements reached with Chile in April 1996 allow Lan Chile to operate: up to 3 weekly B767 services via New Zealand and Tahiti; fifth freedom rights on the basis of code share arrangements  across the Tasman with an Australian carrier; and an open freight regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Future negotiations will review market trends and possible expansion of entitlements. Under both arrangements airlines are permitted to operate supplementary services during peak demand periods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 7</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that Aerolineas Argentinas be granted fifth freedom rights out of New Zealand, on the condition that it maintains at least three weekly services year round, and that similar fifth freedom rights be extended to Lan Chile.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will consider fifth freedom rights in any market based on an assessment of the additional benefits to Australia through the provision of lower fare levels, higher service quality and other gains.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In developing its strategy for the development of air services between Australia and South America, the government has focused on putting in place regulatory arrangements which ensure the maximum number of airlines possible have the opportunity to be involved in the promotion and development of services on the route. Under arrangements put in place by this government, Latin American carriers can now exercise full trans Tasman traffic rights using code share or other joint service arrangements with Australian carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 8</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that the Australian Government encourage Qantas&hyphen;Lan Chile and Aerolineas Argentinas to negotiate the timings of their services in order to offer a greater range of services to travellers between Australia and Latin America.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is unable to respond to this recommendation as timing of services is a commercial matter for the airlines involved. The government does not see its role as encouraging airlines to develop particular strategies; nor favouring market planning to any greater extent than is required by the bilateral negotiation system itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the government notes that Qantas has improved connections with Lan Chile by doubling its South American linkages and now terminates two B767 services per week at Papeete. Connections eastbound are now three hours and westbound, just one hour. Services are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4983"> operated on Mondays and Fridays from Sydney and Thursdays and Sundays from Santiago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the market develops, Qantas will consider additional services with Lan Chile in order to increase the range of services available to travellers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government also notes that Ansett has an established commercial relationship with Aerolineas Argentinas and is discussing means of improving arrangements to provide better connections for its passengers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 9</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that Latin American carriers be granted the right to market routes within and beyond Australia on the basis of code sharing with Australian carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government does not believe the development of air services between Australia and South America will be assisted by granting Latin American carriers access to our Asian markets at this time. As noted above, these routes are highly competitive already, providing consumers with excellent service levels. The granting of the rights necessary to implement this access, even on a code share basis, would be inconsistent with negotiating strategies already developed and in place with a number of our major trading partners in the Asian region. For Australia the balance of advantage lies with continuing good relations with Asian partners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 10</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that negotiations with aviation authorities of Latin American countries ensure that Australian carriers have equivalent rights to those recommended above, so that Australian carriers can enter the market on an equal basis whenever they wish to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government supports the intent of this recommendation. In negotiations with Latin American countries to date, reciprocal rights have been obtained for Australian carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 11</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that the Australian Tourist Commission continue to develop its presence and its activities in Latin America and that it explore the potential for co&hyphen;operation with Latin American carriers in marketing Australia to Latin American travellers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government accepts this recommendation and notes that the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) will continue to develop its activities in Latin America. The ATC maintains a close working relationship with airlines operating in Latin America, including Qantas, Aerolineas Argentinas and Lan Chile. ATC activities in Latin America will continue to concentrate on Argentina, Brazil and Chile as the majority of visitors to Australia come from these countries.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The documents read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government Response to the 4th Report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Treaties Tabled on 15 &amp; 29 October 1996</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As is the case with all the reports tabled since the committee's formation in June 1996, the fourth reflects thorough and expeditious inquiry into a remarkable range of subjects. The government appreciates the marked improvement the committee's scrutiny has made to the Australian community's awareness of and confidence in the treaty&hyphen;making process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.20</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report supported Australian entry into all of the sixteen treaties in question, and appropriate action is being taken in each case; as of March 1997, six were already in force. The only formal recommendation was 1.20: `The committee recommends that Australia takes action in due course to propose that the Convention on Nuclear Safety be amended to include research reactors.' Australia ratified the Convention on 24 December 1996, and it entered into force for Australia on 24 March 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Along with other countries involved in the negotiation of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, Australia has taken the view that a nuclear safety incident involving a research reactor would be unlikely to have international consequences warranting coverage in the Convention. Nevertheless, the government takes note of the committee's recommendation that Australia propose the amendment of the Convention to include research reactors, and will consider in due course whether any such action is appropriate in the light of our experience with the Convention's operation. In this context, it should be noted that the Contracting Parties have yet to hold their first review meeting, at which proposed amendments could be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4984"> discussed. The first review meeting must take place before 24 April 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report also made some observations on consultation in treaty making that call for government comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> 1.19:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> `we believe it would be useful if, in future, NIAs provided information about the actual responses from the states and territories about the texts of treaties proposed for accession.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> 1.99:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> `The committee is concerned that the Australian rice industry was not consulted during the preparation of the NIA for this Agreement [recognising the International Legal Personality of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)]. Implicit in the reforms to the treaty&hyphen;making process is wide and thorough consultation, during the NIA process if not before, with bodies likely to be affected by treaties. In its supervisory role of the process, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade needs to devote greater attention to consultation with such bodies.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> 3.7&hyphen;10:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> `The committee believes that the revised processes for treaty&hyphen;making are working well, with one exception: consultation with the states and territories. Although no specific action was taken, in both the first and second reports we had concerns about the quantity and quality of some of the consultation which seemed to have taken place with the states and territories in the processes which led to the tabling of treaties and the accompanying National Interest Analyses (NIAs). . . The process of parliamentary scrutiny of treaties was established, in part, to ensure that the views of the states and territories were registered because of their legal responsibilities for some matters about which the Commonwealth Government enters into binding international obligations for Australia. . . Because of these general and specific concerns, the coordinating role of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in consulting with all interested parties on the treaties which come before the committee will receive particular attention in future.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.19</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response, it should first be noted that a summary of the views of the parties consulted on the terms of a treaty, including the states and territories, is now required in the pro forma for a National Interest Analysis (NIA) for presentation to parliament. Since late 1996, the version provided to line Departments and agencies has included under the Consultation heading: `A relatively detailed statement setting out the consultations that have occurred in relation to the treaty action between the Commonwealth and the states and territories and with community and other interested parties. A summary of the views of these parties should also be included.' Another change recommended in the committee's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">First Report,</EMPHASIS>  provision 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in NIAs of contact details for the responsible areas of Departments or agencies, has also been acted on in recent tablings. And prompted by the committee's remarks, especially in the fourth report, the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp; Trade has prepared a simplified table of treaty&hyphen;making steps&mdash;a condensation of relevant sections of the Information Kit (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia and International Treaty Making</EMPHASIS> ) and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Negotiation, Conclusion &amp; Implementation of International Treaties &amp; Arrangements </EMPHASIS> that are already widely distributed&mdash;and is making it available to line officials, with reiterated advice on the importance of consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.7&hyphen;10</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, the committee's concern for the adequacy of consultation with the states and territories is noted by the government. In no case that the government is aware of (since the May 1996 reform of the process) has any area of Commonwealth Government failed to inform the states and territories of significant treaty developments, or resisted cross&hyphen;jurisdictional co&hyphen;operation when the states and territories have sought it. The government would be interested to know of any specific examples the committee may be able to provide in which consultation with the states and territories has been deficient, and especially in which the treaty negotiations have been of sensitivity and importance to the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commonwealth will continue to provide full and early information to the states and territories about treaty negotiations and actions contemplated or underway&mdash;but thereafter relies on the other jurisdictions to identify their own interests and to become involved accordingly. There are already several Commonwealth&hyphen;State institutions that provide forums for discussion of treaties, both general (notably the Standing Committee on Treaties (SCOT) and the Standing Committee of Attorneys&hyphen;General) and subject&hyphen;specific (such as the Intergovernmental Committee for Ecologically Sustainable Development, or the Consultative Forum on Mutual Recognition Agreements on Conformity Assessment). The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) established the Treaties Council to consider international instruments of the greatest concern to the states and territories at Head&hyphen;of&hyphen;Government level. And there is the general principle, spelt out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Principles &amp; Procedures for Commonwealth&hyphen;State Consultation on Treaties </EMPHASIS> agreed on by COAG at its meeting in June 1996, that the states and territories will be fully involved at every stage&mdash;from the negotiating mandate through the negotiating delegations to the domestic implementation&mdash;for all treaties that they identify as being of sensitivity and importance to themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.99</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, as to the underlying philosophy of community consultation and the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp; Trade in giving effect to it: consultation in treaty making was the main theme of the government's reform of the process last year. There is no standard 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4985"> formula for adequate consultation (beyond the invitation to states and territories through the SCOT process); Departments and agencies are advised to think widely and carefully about those interested and affected. Different circumstances apply to different instruments, so deliberate duplication was built into the system. Sections of the community with concerns about a treaty or class of treaties are welcome, for example: to contact the Department for information about the status of the instruments in question and to be pointed to the responsible area of the machinery of government; or to develop dialogue with Government Departments about continuing programs; or to make representations through ministers; or to raise concerns through Members of Parliament; or to enlist the states and territories in taking an interest. The responsible officials in line Departments and agencies must identify the main stakeholders for particular treaties&mdash;but the safety net for consultation is parliamentary tabling and the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. It is not a lapse of the process when proposed treaty actions before the committee attract some submissions or evidence that has not already been incorporated in the government's consideration; this is one reason the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trick or Treaty?</EMPHASIS>  inquiry recommended such a committee's establishment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are several reasons why an NIA might record only limited consultation before a treaty reaches the final and most public forum (that is, parliament): international practice as it relates to the confidentiality of bilateral treaties before signature; the routine nature of the action in question or the fact that the government had not been aware of any particular controversy; a nil response from those invited to contribute; or urgency (not that urgency lessens the eventual requirement for transparency). In the case of the IRRI&hyphen;NIA, the government had taken the view that the regularising of the Institute's international status was not directly of concern to the domestic industry&mdash;though it is now  prepared to accept that it would have been better to seek confirmation from farming and ricegrowing industry bodies before presenting the action to parliament. The Department of Foreign Affairs &amp; Trade ensures a standard format, readily understood prose, and the provision of an appropriate level of detail against all the sub&hyphen;headings of the NIA pro forma. Its invariable advice in discussing treaty finalisation with the responsible officials is to remind them that before the binding step is taken, the whole proposed treaty action will be published and scrutinised by the committee, and that the consultation undertaken must therefore be defensible.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I of course do not know the contents of the reply of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) at this stage, but this is a very important resolution. It relates to the military dictatorship in Nigeria and the continuing oppression of the Ogoni people. Some 20 community leaders are in gaol and face the potential for summary execution. I now do have a copy of the minister's response, which simply reiterates the points made by Senator Parer back in May. I would have expected that we would get more from the Minister for Foreign Affairs on this matter. It has raised a great deal of concern and horror amongst Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can all remember that during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in New Zealand just two years ago, despite world appeals to save the lives of the then eight Ogoni leaders, including Ken Saro-Wiwa&mdash;the great poet, community worker and environmentalist of the Ogoni people&mdash;General Abacha's dictatorship in Nigeria took them out and hanged all eight of them in front of the world, defying the Commonwealth heads of government. My motion simply said, `Time's up, General Abacha. It is time the Commonwealth governments got tough with you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next meeting is coming up in Britain in September. The Australian and British governments should be saying to the Abacha regime, `There is no place for you at our table.' That is not what we have got back from the Minister for Foreign Affairs. He has ducked the call by this Senate for the Australian government to take sterner action. It is a complicated business. It arises out of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> arrival of the Shell oil company in 1958 in Ogoni land and the consequent massive degradation of the homelands of the Ogoni people, with billions of dollars being extracted in profits by that company, but the failure of the return in social welfare and opportunities to the Ogoni people. They have become active because of this. They have rebelled against it in a peaceful manner, but they have been met with repression by the Abacha regime and a totally inadequate response from the Shell oil company, which has been an instigatory factor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No wonder we now see car stickers on many cars around this country saying `Boycott Shell', `Avoid Shell'. There is a great concern by citizens who are aware of this that the Shell oil company is deeply implicated. That being the case, however, there is a dictatorship which has the hide, in recent times, to be pretending to have a finer side to it as it has moved in to restore what it calls democratic principles in Sierra Leone, just along the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That aside, the Ogoni people continue to suffer. There is enormous repression. There is a failure to provide public services. There is continuing environmental degradation. There is great fear by anybody who speaks out. Recently we have had Komene Famaa, the representative of the Ogoni people, brought to Australia by the good offices of the Body Shop, who has spoken at a number of public meetings and shown the harrowing films of the torture, the death, the homeland destruction of the Ogoni people by the oil extraction process. There are over 100 oil wells worked there by Shell and other companies. In particular there is the repression of civil liberties by this nasty and violent and cruel dictatorship of General Abacha.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this country can do is say, `I can't expand on the words that Senator Parer gave to the Senate a month ago.' What about responding to the motion? The Senate has called on the Australian government to put a block on General Abacha's apparatchiks appearing and sullying the conference in Britain in two 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4987"> months time. What about responding to that, Mr Downer? Well, no such thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We get this wimpish response, this one&hyphen;sentence throwaway saying, `Don't ask me; Senator Parer said something in the Senate a month ago, and that will do.' It will not do. It is a pretty disgraceful abrogation of the obligation on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to act like a statesperson, to have a bit of spine and to stand up for the Australian sentiment which, as far as I can gauge, is totally with the Ogoni people in their extreme suffering on the other side of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will not do that we get a cast&hyphen;off response to the Senate like this. If we are going to pass motions here which mean something to the Australian government, then we should expect a more considered, in&hyphen;depth and thoughtful response at least. But we have not got it. No doubt, Minister Downer has not got it&mdash;a little like the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who is currently touring overseas, has not got it. I will guarantee that the plight of the Ogoni people was not brought up while the Prime Minister had afternoon tea yesterday with Baroness Thatcher. It would not suit either of their sensibilities to get into such a topic and determine what they might do about this dastardly lot who are in control&mdash;not  through the ballot box, but through the gun&mdash;in Nigeria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a pretty appalling, pathetic and totally unsatisfactory response that the Senate has been given today. The people of Australia who are concerned about this vile dictatorship in Nigeria will know&mdash;from the failure of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, to give a proper response&mdash;that he does not care adequately about this situation in a Commonwealth country. Apparently, as Mr Downer sits on his hands, he is going to be invited yet again to sit cheek by jowl with these people while at home their thugs are killing and torturing people and depriving people of their civil rights.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the first report which I have tabled concerns the proposed decontamination for disposal of the former Albion Explosives Factory site, Deer Park, Melbourne. This project was referred to the Committee in March 1994, but the Committee was unable to report on it for reasons which I will explain later.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The project examined by the Committee involves a proposed agreement between the Department of Defence and the Victorian Urban Land Authority for the decontamination of the site of the former Albion Explosives Factory at Deer Park. This is part of a series of steps which would also allow the Urban Land Authority to develop the 460 hectare site for housing, industrial, retail and community services, setting land aside for nature conservation purposes, for open space and for habitat protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Urban Land Authority will be responsible for the management of decontamination of the site and its development for sale. The return to the Commonwealth would be a series of payments from the Urban Land Authority, based on the value of the land assessed in an uncontaminated state. Under these arrangements, the net cost to Defence for the remaining remediation works was estimated to be $3.84 million.The Committee has recommended that Defence should enter into the proposed arrangements with the Urban Land Authority. The proposal put to the present Committee is vastly different from the earlier proposal. That proposal, referred to the Committee in 1994, was for the decontamination of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4988"> site with no development. The cost of the earlier proposal was $57 million&mdash;this was in addition to about $15&hyphen;20 million which had been spent on cleaning up sixty per cent of the site before it was referred to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was due to the diligence and persistence of the previous Chairman of the Committee&mdash;the Honourable Member for Throsby, that these savings to the Commonwealth are now possible. Therefore, the present proposal, estimated to cost $3.84 million, is a marked improvement on the earlier proposal and demonstrates the effectiveness and importance of the Public Works Committee as a watchdog on public expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main findings of the Committee's report are that there is a need to decontaminate and remediate the remaining 40 per cent of the Albion Explosives factory site and for total site disposal. Furthermore, any costs to the Commonwealth of decontamination and remediation should be offset against the potential value of the property.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also concluded that the involvement of the Urban Land Authority as the manager of the cleanup and development of the site can be justified on the basis of expertise and a proven track record. It was suggested that the developer of the site should have been tested on the open market. The Committee considers, however, that the decision by Defence to enter into a single source arrangement with the Urban Land Authority, without testing the market, was based on independent advice to Defence from a number of sources.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contaminated soil stored on the site or still in situ will be relocated to specially engineered repositories. Based on expert advice, of the remediation options considered, the on&hyphen;site repositories are feasible technically, offer the greatest flexibility and have cost advantages. Whilst the Commonwealth will retain the long&hyphen;term risk arising from site decontamination, expert advice to the Committee indicated that there will not be any health problems caused by the use of on&hyphen;site repositories.The question of responsibility for monitoring the repositories remains unresolved and the Committee has therefore recommended that this responsibility should be assigned to relevant State authorities at the time of the finalisation of the formal agreement for the remediation, disposal and development of the site by Defence and the Urban Land Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Preliminary Land Use Plan for the entire site has been developed. This plan will need to be further refined into a Local Structure Plan under the Brimbank Planning Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the proposal, the State of Victoria will assume ownership of a large amount of parkland to be managed by the Victoria University of Technology. For this reason, the Committee has recommended that in land transfer negotiations between the Commonwealth and the State of Victoria the significant improvement to public amenity arising from the transfer should be recognised. The Committee has also recommended that any additional costs 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> associated with infrastructure improvements on land designated for public use should not be the responsibility of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A large proportion of an area designated as parkland is the habitat of the endangered Legless Lizard. The Committee was assured that relevant Commonwealth environment protection agencies are satisfied that the process involved in the progressive sale will adequately provide for Commonwealth commitments relating to the protection of endangered species on the site.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Very little of the old explosives factory buildings remain. The Committee has recommended that apart from tree lines and the black powder mill, all existing structures on the site should be demolished as they present a potential health and safety hazard. A management regime will need to be developed for the black powder mill.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second report which I have tabled involves the proposed Sydney Airport: International Terminal&mdash;Olympic upgrading proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal examined by the Committee involves the provision of additional terminal facilities required to meet the expected demand by 2003. In summary, these facilities are:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Witnesses were asked a series of standard questions to elicit their response to the fundamental issue under consideration, namely the future of Sydney Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Faced with the increased demand on the international terminal, that a decision on the second airport has not been made and that construction of any new facilities must be completed by the end of 1999, what choice does the Committee have other than to recommend that the work proceed. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4989"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The so&hyphen;called "do nothing" option is not feasible. To do nothing would result in a decline in the level of service to passengers and compromise the efficient operation of the terminal. In terms of aircraft, the option would result in aircraft possibly waiting for an hour or an hour and a half on taxiways before accessing aircraft parking positions. Inside the Customs hall, passengers could be left waiting for up to two hours for their baggage. Clearly, this is unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against this background, the report concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, that Sydney Airport, as the main gateway to Australia, has an essential role in meeting increasing passenger demand into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, as no decision on the location of a second Sydney airport has yet been made, Sydney Airport remains the only international airport in NSW.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, if the improvements required to cater for increased traffic are not made, the ability of the airport to cope with demand will be seriously impeded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fourthly, the timing of the Olympics and its associated pressures on facilities mean that any improvements will need to commence immediately  in order to avoid construction during the Olympic period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, forecasts provided by the Federal Airports Corporation indicate that ten additional gate positions and associated facilities are required which would satisfy requirements until 2003.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concluded that the success of the project is dependent on continuing and adequate consultations between the Federal Airports Corporation and all affected users. In this context, particular attention should be given to the needs of people with disabilities during the detailed design phases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report notes that a large proportion of the cost of the proposed investment will be offset by increased revenue expected from retail operations. The Committee was assured by the Federal Airports Corporation of the commercial viability of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is one matter about which the report is critical of the Federal Airports Corporation. The proposal had not received the required clearances by relevant Commonwealth environment protection authorities before it was referred to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the issues raised by local government authorities and community groups regarding the impact of further development and the Federal Airports Corporation's responses to them, should have been the subject of environmental impact assessment and subsequent clearance by protection authorities before the public hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Airports Corporation was in the process of preparing a Notice of Intent, which it intended lodging with Environment Australia some time after the hearing. The Committee believes the Federal Airports Corporation proceeded on an erroneous assumption that the timing of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> environmental clearances could await the Committee's consideration of the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was stated by the FAC that issues raised during the Committee's inquiry would be taken into account in the preparation of the impact assessment. The Committee does not see itself as a substitute for an appropriate environmental assessment of any proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This responsibility rests with proponents complying in a timely manner with the provisions of the Act before proposals are referred to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has therefore recommended that any further development of Sydney Airport should have appropriate environmental clearances before being referred to it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend both reports to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">APPROPRIATIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unwritten sub text to this bill is about the failure of this government to come to terms with its national responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A subtext underlined by a government which promised honesty, integrity and accountability but delivered lies, deceit and secrecy&mdash;a government committed to the trickle down effect, determined to implement a far right agenda that directs govern ment resources away from those in need, away from Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A government whose policy direction is in shambles. A government wreaked by internal tension and indecision. A government whose total preoccupation with the powers of the market is rapidly delivering plummeting consumer confidence, declining national standards and escalating unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A government who has totally abandoned the pretext of any commitments that they gave to the Australian public in the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEETYA&mdash;THE BIG LOSER</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to speak specifically on the effects of the budget on the programs administered by DEETYA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we see contained in this Appropriation Bill is a total abandonment of urgency in the Governments effort to tackle the question of unemployment&mdash;particularly youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see a total abandonment of national responsibility for ensuring quality and equity for the whole gamut of educational provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see an abandonment of Commonwealth responsibility for growth funding for schools, TAFE and universities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, we see a continuation of an arrogant and irresponsible attitude towards the education community, an attitude which sees policy replaced by rhetoric and leadership replaced by dishonesty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CUTS IN 1997&mdash;98</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On May 2nd, the Minister said quite categorically that `there would be no bad news for the education sector' in the 1997 budget&mdash;no bad news! 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What have we seen&mdash;further cuts to universities and TAFE and the abandonment of support for a quality, public, national mass education system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have seen:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. A further 4700 undergraduate places abolished through the phasing out of the Higher Education Commonwealth Industry Places Scheme. This reduction, of $67.4 million over 4 years, will weaken universities, particularly regional universities' ability to establish strong industry links and funding sources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. we see a further $72 million cut from vocational education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. A further 1% cut in university funding on top of the $400 million cut announced in the 1996-97 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. The unilateral removal of growth funding for VET</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. we see the phasing out of 4.5 million over 4 years in specific funding to Language Australia&mdash;,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. 38.7 million over 4 years cuts to Abstudy,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. $11.2 million from NBEET's abolition&mdash;of course we are still to see the legislation debated in the Senate and the list goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite widespread community concern and turmoil in the education sector we have seen a budget which not only totally fails to come to grips with the problems but which further exacerbates those problems&mdash;totally contrary to the pre-budget statements of the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government's policies at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels are designed to shrink the public sector and promote the private.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, despite misleading media reports and deceptive statements by the Ministers, these measures will result in a market of `advantage'&mdash;promoting advantage for the privileged few and resulting in disadvantage for the many.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">VOCATIONAL EDUCATION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The deception of the government is no more evident than in VET funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last week I asked Senator Vanstone about the findings of the KPMG consultants report, Costing and Resourcing of New Apprenticeships, Senator Vanstone was unable to respond, she knows, as does the rest of the community, that assertions made by the government about growth in the sector are largely unjustified and unfunded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The KPMG report states that resources must be lifted from the current 20% to as much as 30-40% of the Vocational Education budget to meet what is expected to be projected demand. That means an increase of $400-$500 million needs to be found to fund the Government's New Apprenticeships scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that this report has been canvassed extensively at the recent Senate Estimates and has created an uproar with State Education Ministers in Darwin on Wednesday June 11 and Thursday June 12, the Senator's feigned ignorance of the report is astounding. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4991"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Vanstone knows that the Commonwealth has budgeted no more money for TAFE than that required to pay normal entitlements to trainees and employers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be the states, who have already had their Financial Assistance Grants slashed, who must now be responsible for funding growth in the National Vocational Education System.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A prospect that according to the states is completely untenable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The states rightly point out that they have already lost millions of dollars that were provided by the Keating government's labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well TAFE will lose its virtual monopoly of government funded training to private providers from the start of next year.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And yet Dr Kemp continues to make misleading statements. Promising 100,000 new apprenticeships in 1997/98 when he knows that the Commonwealth is only funding an additional 9000 new apprenticeships on top of the 91,000 apprenticeships in already existing programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Promising an additional 500,000 TAFE places&mdash;places which are to be funded by state governments. State governments that have just suffered an `efficiency gain' cut to their budgets of an additional $70 million over 4 years on top of last years cut of $183 million and the unilateral scrapping of $70 million in growth funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it any wonder that following the recent Ministerial Council in Darwin, State Ministers collectively criticised Dr Kemp's conduct. Accusing him of `smoke and mirrors' tricks with the national media by implying that the Commonwealth was contributing more to TAFE than was actually the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Victorian Minister Phil Honeywood has stated that `The hypocrisy is there for all to see'. . . . .That his colleagues were `aghast' at Kemp's press release and the way he had carried on television.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But this isn't the end of government deception in regard to the lack funding for their Vocational education announcements. . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On June 3rd at the hearing of the Employment, Education and Training Senate Estimates Committee Minister Vanstone, in her defence of Dr Kemp, misinformed the committee about the government's aborted plans to introduce a HECS style system into Vocational Education and Training (VET).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She did it both in her own words, and by her silence about the apparently misleading answers given by Mr Moran, the CEO of ANTA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On this specific issue of HECS fees and in response to my highlighting the section of the KPMG report which stated `In the future, the option of deferred payment through a HECS type scheme might be examined when the market benefit of VET qualifications is widely recognised', Mr Moran responded: 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just a view from the consultant, which simply has not been considered . . . it has not been considered by ANTA and as far as I am aware, it has not been considered by ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minister Vanstone was invited to respond and in her response she gave what is at best a misleading answer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Vanstone: I can tell you that I certainly have not asked for anything to be prepared on it to assist my mind on it, and I can assure you that Dr Kemp has not either. Whether there is someone out there who aspires to having both either or both either or both of our jobs cooking up a scheme to have this raised, I cannot tell you, but I can tell you that I have not asked for it to be considered, and Dr Kemp has not asked for any work on it to be considered, so that is about as conclusive as I can be for you.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even more was to be confirmed about the Commonwealth's supposed total ignorance of any plans for HECS in TAFE.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Moran:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was no consideration of changing fees paid by students, either in its own right or as a means of finding a contribution to the figure to which you refer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But this was far from the truth and it was left to the Victorian Liberal Party Minister for Training to expose this deceit, claiming on June 11 following the Darwin MINCO meeting that there were secret plans to introduce new TAFE fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the words of Phil Honeywood Dr Kemp had committed `a betrayal of trust' over plans to expand the number of tertiary places.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the issue of `consensus', Phil Honeywood assessed the views of state ministers stating that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a complete sense of frustration that Dr Kemp is a centralist who does not acknowledge the part states play in funding training I feel there is a betrayal of trust.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Honeywood stated that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">David Kemp tabled a report that envisaged a HECS fee being introduced for students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Victoria moved successfully, with the support of other states, that a HECS fee for TAFE students not be supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Honeywood clarified the situation further in the Age on Friday 13 June. In a vicious attack of the Commonwealth government's TAFE funding plans, Mr Honeywood claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">..it may lead to the dismantling of the system and the introduction of university-style fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Honeywood said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Victoria did not agree to the conditions under which the Federal Government proposed to continue its normal funding. That's why the resolution says we disagree, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4992"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">he said, describing yesterday's meeting between the states and Dr Kemp as `extremely heated'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Honeywood further called into question Dr Kemp's motives, saying that at a recent meeting of Training Ministers, Dr Kemp had tabled an Australian National Training Authority document that canvassed a `deferred payment mechanism' for TAFEs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Kemp's spokesman replied by saying that, the training authority document was as much the states'  document as it was the Commonwealth's, and said it was Dr Kemp who had said the `deferred payment' clause should be removed because it was inaccurate and he had not such plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Kemp, also tried to weasel out of the situation by claiming that it was he who had personally moved to have reference to the fee plan scrapped from the report&mdash;a report which was written by the government's vocational education adviser&mdash;ANTA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What does Mr Honeywood say about this proposition?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Honeywood said that at the ministers' only meeting in May, where the document was tabled, Dr Kemp had argued the clause should stay. It was after states protested that&mdash;as chairman of the committee&mdash;he proposed the clause be removed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said the federal plan was viewed by the states as a way of forcing them to deliver up to 40 per cent more TAFE places (there are now 1.2 million nationally) with no extra funds from the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we have here is not only a prima facie case that the Commonwealth's Vocational Education Program is in disarray, that Dr Kemp plays fast and lose with the truth, but that Senator Vanstone and Mr Moran, the CEO of ANTA apparently misled Senate Estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He apparently misled Senate Estimates on an issue as basic as the Commonwealth's ability to fund their plans for the VET sector and their proposal to introduce a deferred payment scheme for TAFE.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a very serious issue which requires the Minister to respond promptly to the request from the Senate Employment, Education and Training Committee for an explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SCHOOLS EDUCATION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is in the area of schools education where the ideological bent of this government is most evident. Where the market approach is encouraged and equity is outlawed as a socialist concept.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the principle of universal free public education is abandoned and our public schools left to die the death of a thousand cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we see in the schools area are policies designed to fundamentally undermine the traditional long standing commitment of all governments to a quality education for all students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In schools, as in VET, we have seen DEETYA officials and the state governments expose the hypocrisy of the government. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Kemp proclaimed on May 13th that there would be a `$152 million boost for schools'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The truth is that this figure comprises around $108 million automatically built-in for inflation, $41 million for increases in enrolment, and a further $25 million to fulfil a promise of the previous government to needier schools. Net result? A real cut in schools funding! And how was this word trickery explained by departmental officials at the recent round of Budget estimates? It was described as `the best presentational gloss on the normal operating of government.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is in the area of funding support for government schools that Dr Kemp's rhetoric has been most exposed. State Education Ministers, Liberal, National and Labor have publicly supported Labor's consistent stance that the Enrolment Benchmark Adjustment will be a disaster for public school systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even the Minister's own department has confirmed that through the EBA, $26.763 million will be cut from public education this financial year and some $270 million over the forward estimates to the year 1999-2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another public exclamation by Dr Kemp, not supported by specific funding measures was that schools would benefit from a further $200 million to act as labour exchanges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Upon closer examination at Senate Estimates, it was revealed that very few schools would actually get any money under the program at all, they would simply be allowed to tender for the service on the open market, in competition with many established, specialists providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">UNEMPLOYMENT&mdash;`BE PATIENT SAYS THE MINISTER'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to tackling unemployment, there is little in this budget to give hope to those who are long term unemployed. It is an inditement of this government that unemployment continues to rise and jobs decline.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This month we have seen labour force figures which show a loss of 40,300 jobs in one month- 33,100 full time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This months unemployment figures show that there are now 242,5000 long term unemployed people in Australia&mdash;the highest number in two years. This is not surprising to us on this side of the chamber, we said this would be the result of the government's reckless dismantling of Working Nation programs a year ago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the last 15 months since the Howard Government came to office we have seen:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">- the number of full time jobs has actually fallen by 700</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">- the number of male full time jobs has fallen by 9900</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">- the number of people unemployed has risen by 39,000</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">- unemployment rate has risen from 8.5% to 8.8%</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">- and most importantly in regard to the promises made at the last election, youth unemployment rate has risen from 27.4% to 27.5%. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4993"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This last statistic is of most relevance given that at the last election John Howard played so much on the insecurity of Australian families, particularly on the issue of youth unemployment. At that time as now the Government has not articulated a coherent strategy for tackling the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Youth Allowance will strip the dole from young unemployed people and shift as many as 30,000 young unemployed from unemployment statistics on to the already stretched resources of Australian families.- A work for pocket money scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the issue of unemployment the Minister said `be patient'. Australians will have to be very patient if they hope to see any solutions to the nation's problems come out of this Appropriations Bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are debating the appropriation bills, which is an opportunity for senators in this place to express their views about the last budget. As Senator Carr has said, because of the time constraints placed upon us in this chamber my remarks will need to be brief and will be given in summary form&mdash;unfortunately, I will not be able to develop my arguments in full&mdash;in order to save the necessary time for other legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say up&hyphen;front what the opposition's view of this budget is, and, in particular, what major failings it has. This is an extraordinary, lacklustre budget. It was off the front pages of the newspapers by the Friday of the week in which it was brought down. It is the only budget I know of that registered a less than one-third approval rating with the public. Less than one-third of the public approved of this document. It also generated about a four per cent fall in the approval rating of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it should have done, because it did nothing to improve employment and it really did nothing to improve national savings&mdash;one 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the areas targeted for this budget. When the government targeted national savings they went off and brought back a scheme that leads to national dissaving. It is a budget which continues the attack on families that occurred in the last budget. It is a budget that continues with further mindless cuts to various government programs that should stimulate demand in the community. It is a budget that got the thumbs down from the financial markets because it failed to actually go about its job in the way in which it boasted it would before the budget, raising expectations which, when we saw the actual document, were dashed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget comes behind the major cost cutting budget&mdash;the first budget for the conservatives after 13 years of Labor rule in this nation&mdash;brought down last year. That budget made massive cuts to Commonwealth expenditure. The effect of that was to contract domestic demand in the economy and slow down growth of the economy. The purpose of the budget before last was not to expand or grow the economy, create opportunities for employment, deal with the long queue of unemployed and offer job prospects in growth industries and attractive and interesting highly skilled and well trained technically proficient jobs across industry; it was to contract domestic economic growth. That was the impact of the massive cuts that the government made in public sector outlays set down in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget&mdash;the one we are now debating&mdash;followed on in that course. The strategy behind the last budget and this budget is that the world economy is growing relatively strongly&mdash;in particular, the economies of the Asia-Pacific area are growing startlingly strongly&mdash;and that Australia, despite having a contractionary domestic budget, will be pulled through and our economy will grow because of the strength of the international economy. That was the thinking behind it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at the outcome of this last budget we see that the target for the 1996&hyphen;97 budget for economic growth in this nation was 3.5 per cent. But we find that at the end  of one year of coalition rule the growth level was in fact 2.4 per cent&mdash;that is, the government forecast about 1.1 per cent more for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4994"> economic growth than they achieved. In other words, the strategy behind the budget did not work and did not deliver the growth outcomes that they expected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contraction in the domestic economy was so great that we saw that last month's Yellow Pages survey of small business opinion found that 80 per cent of small business people in Australia believed that there was a lack of confidence for them in the future of the economy, that the demand would not be there to justify them having a rosier view of the prospects for Australia. The fact that the government underscored its growth rate has permeated the economic thinking and the confidence levels in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say today that there are a number of things that the government can do to improve unemployment. We know that jobs are being lost at the present time in Australian industry. Australian industry is in job shedding mode. Last month 40,000 jobs were lost in Australia, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The biggest failure in the first budget and in this budget is that there is no strategy in place at all to focus on unemployment. In fact, the amount of attention given to the problem of unemployment&mdash;the problem recognised in Australia as the most serious economic problem of all&mdash;is a few meagre lines hidden away in the documentation that accompanies the budget papers. There is no direct attack on that problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has four basic strategies for what can be done about unemployment. The first is that the budget has to be a budget for growth, not a budget for contraction. We believe that the budget should be set not to achieve 3&half; per cent growth, as it is, but rather to achieve greater growth, of 4 and 4&half; per cent, so that school leavers will have jobs to go to at the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Shooting for a 3.5 or 3.75 per cent growth rate, as the budget does, means that the government has made a deliberate choice not to grow the economy at a level to provide work for school leavers or diminish the unemployment queue. The Australian economy should grow at 4 and 4&half; per cent to make a dent on unemployment. The fact that the government have not done that means 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they have chosen to continue with their contractionary line of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget also has been more restrictive than it could have been and should have been with respect to monetary policy. I must say that the government will boast about its record on monetary policy and the number of cuts that have been achieved for interest rates, but the economy is still flat and the first interest rate reduction was three or four months later than it should have been. It was late because of the Reserve Bank's anxiety about the implication of the government clearing up the accord and abandoning wages policy. It is certainly arguable that the Reserve Bank, with the direct support of the government, has been overly focused on its statutory anti-inflationary objective and insufficiently attentive to its pro&hyphen;employment statutory objective as well. I make the point that monetary policy could have been set more effectively and, if it was, growth would have come sooner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we ought to do more to hitch onto external demand. As I said, the underlying philosophy of the two budgets has been that world growth is going strongly and therefore Australia will benefit. But when you actually look at what the budget does, you see that the things that connect us to economic growth have been cut back or dismantled. Austrade has been cut back in its total expenditure, crimping the ability of our trade agency to find openings for Australians and Australian companies that wish to sell abroad and export, earning foreign credits for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, the National Trade and Investment Outlook Conference is now to be abandoned&mdash;a conference which has a proven record of generating massive income for this country. Our showcase of Australian industry to the world&mdash;the sort of thing one ought to do to connect Australia to the international economy and the growth levels to be achieved there&mdash;is now to be abandoned and, we are told at some time in the future, privatised. The only conclusion one can come to is that this government is not interested in promoting Australian industry to the world market.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4995">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know from the previous budget that the export market development grants scheme has been cut back. Now a cap has been opposed for the total funding of that scheme. The government persists in maintaining that situation. Therefore, support for Australian exporters to win contracts abroad are circumscribed and limited at the very time we need to grow our export market much higher. In terms of opening up new markets, we have had from the government this cute little phrase of `aggressive bilateralism'. When I explored the detail of aggressive bilateralism at the Senate economics committee that dealt with budget estimates we got back a fair range of hollow answers&mdash;answers that did not explain what the achievements of this policy had been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only conclusion one can come to is that this is some sort of slogan but a slogan which does not have any direct impact on getting Australian goods and services into foreign markets where there are market obstructions to access. The record of so-called aggressive bilateralism, which is touted as the solution to our trade woes, is in fact a sorry record indeed. The only example I know of any like success was with the negotiations that the government engaged in with the United States automobile producers over Howe Leather. But that set our cause back, not forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the underlying structure of what this government can do to connect Australian industry, to hitch its wagon, to the star of massive growth in Asian economies has been demolished. The connection is not there. Australian industry confidence is down as a consequence. We are missing out on the opportunities of growth in this region because of that and, in doing so, Australians are out of work as a knock&hyphen;on effect of the indolence of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth thing that the government should have installed in this budget in order to attack the primary problem of unemployment was a conscious commitment to improving the nation's skills base. It has still not done so. That means not destroying university funding and not having a HEC scheme deterring people from higher education. It means not running down our state school system in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia. It means having effective labour market programs that will provide real job experience, real training and a real psychological boost for those who might otherwise become permanently welfare dependent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It means all of those things, but, in essence, my  message is that there are four major points that the government should have implemented in this budget which have been ignored. The budget is not a budget that deals with unemployment; it is a budget that neglects that key issue. It is a budget that proposes changes to national savings, as I said earlier, and other senators have covered that in considerable detail, so I do not need to repeat their contributions to this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The net effect of the government's initiative on national savings is in fact to reduce the potential for national savings that would have flowed had the government stuck with the scheme of the former government and developed the relationship between national savings and individual superannuation contributions of workers. Had it done that, we would have developed a much bigger and much more impressive national savings pool which would have enabled Australian investors to own Australian industry and enabled Australia to invest in the growth of Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the savings proposal put forward by the government has been universally rubbished by the markets and by commentators is some indication of the government's failure to actually address this issue. What they have is a bandaid in place to try to stop the haemorrhage of a major wound in the economy. They have done away with all of the other stitching and all of the other bandages to solve this problem. They have cut them free and tried to put a bandaid there that will fix it. It will not. The problem is far greater than they recognise. Touting the national savings initiative around as some sort of answer has got a hollow laugh from all of the economists in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">National savings is a problem for Australia. We do not generate enough savings in this country to invest in the development of our nation. We are net importers of capital. We  are not exporters of capital to the world in net terms. The sooner we can generate a level of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4996"> national savings and a pool of national savings in order to start to own our own industry sector, the sooner we can start to see better, more solid and more sustained economic growth in this country. Labor had that structure in place. This government has dismantled it. The people who will suffer most because of that are the unemployed and those who are soon to be unemployed because of these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of things I would want to say in this debate, but my time is limited. I conclude my remarks at this point by reminding the Senate that, if we are going to hitch our wagon to the star of the fast growing East Asian economies, we ought to do more about promoting trade to those sectors, not cutting it back. This budget cuts it back.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This budget and, indeed, the policies of this government remind me of an event that took place over the weekend. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) went to the cricket, and I think he may have finally seen some. I was reminded of the English first drop batsman, Alec Stewart, who thought he was doing the right thing when he raised his bat and allowed one of McGrath's deliveries to go by, only to see his stumps knocked over. This is very much the attitude of this government to the missiles and the problems that our economy hurls upon it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government relies upon a faith in the market. This government has said as much many times&mdash;that it is freeing up the market. All of its policies have been designed to achieve things such as the interest rate cuts that it has claimed when, in fact, at least half of those were due to the state of the economy and the work of the previous government&mdash;but I will not take away the other half of the credit from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government relies upon that to be the mechanism which will create the economic conditions for the market to prosper. But the reality is that there is low consumer confidence, not high confidence. I would suggest that, when talking about the people who have benefited from interest rate reductions, what has happened is that, instead of reducing their mortgage repayments, they have allowed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those repayments to continue at the same level so that their loans are paid off more quickly, because they do not have confidence and are frightened about their jobs and employment. They are not secure, and they are not spending for that reason. So the government cannot rely upon its faith in the market because it is not delivering at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are couple of newspaper articles I want to refer to. They appeared on consecutive days. The first, which appeared on 18 June in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on page 4 under the heading `Enough of economic extremism' by Geoffrey Barker, refers to a report by Professors Mathews and Grewal in relation to unemployment. First of all, I want to go to the article that followed it the next day in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> under the headline `Policies cheat the children of the poor' by Kenneth Davidson. I think his critique of this government bears relating on the public record. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And it all happened on the same afternoon. On Tuesday, the Social Security Minister, Senator Jocelyn Newman, said the Government would abolish the dole for 16 and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds and impose a severe parental means test on the dole for 18 to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, while the Treasurer, Mr Peter Costello, promised the proposed GST would be used to lower the burden on pay&hyphen;as&hyphen;you&hyphen;earn taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contempt for poor youth and their families is palpable; no jobs, no training and now no money, which is being earmarked for the rich.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government schools in poor areas, whose funding is being cut by state and federal governments, will bear the brunt of dysfunctional young people forced back into classrooms already under strain from cuts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, what this government has done&mdash;and other governments, it is conceded&mdash;is cut money to the secondary school sector; it has distributed more money, in effect, to the private schools. But the 16- and 17-year-olds who are being denied unemployment benefits and directed back to school will end up in the government sector. So the cutting of funds to that sector, when combined with this measure, will further disadvantage them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Later in the article, Mr Davidson goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year Mr Costello found an $8 billion "black hole" in the forward estimates of government spending and revenue left by the previous Government which had to be covered by massive spending cuts that just happened 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4997"> to target the people and programs considered anathema to the Howard Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This year Mr Costello found room in the Budget for a tax rebate on the savings of the very rich who have the equivalent of $60,000 in the bank. This move will cost $1.1 billion in revenue next financial year, rising to $4 billion in 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">By general consent, the rebate will do virtually nothing to promote savings. Since it was elected, the Howard Government has cut some $1.5 billion from labor market programs designed to help the unemployed. It has expressed its concern for the unemployed by "labor market reform" designed to undermine the power of trade unions and make it easier for employers to sack staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unemployment continuing to rise? That's easy. The problem can be solved with even more labor market deregulation. Still a problem? Even easier. What we need is tax reform defined as lower income taxes, easier fringe benefit taxes and cuts in capital gains taxes to help small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">How do these reforms solve unemployment?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point I want to go back to the article I mentioned earlier which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. That article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In an analysis sharply at odds with yesterday's widely reported views of Professor Ross Garnaut, Professors Mathews and Grewal say that unemployment will not be reduced until governments take active steps to create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"This will involve increased spending on public sector infrastructure, education, health, urban services, regional rehabilitation and the environment; constructive labour market programs; and more generally a rejection of the laissez&hyphen;faire philosophy that requires governments to abdicate from an interventionist role", they say.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The idea that the problem of unemployment can be solved by the market failed tragically during the Great Depression," they write. "It [has] failed just as badly in the late 20th century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Almost by stealth, the idea that government has the prime responsibility for reducing unemployment was abandoned in favour of market solutions which emphasised the need to depress wages, a remedy which contrasted oddly with the soaring emolument packages of those who were prescribing wage reductions," they say.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Isn't that true? Isn't that exactly what has been happening in this country? We have heard so much about those who head the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Business Council getting million dollar&hyphen;plus salary packages, and then advocating a reduced minimum wage and deregulation of the labour market&mdash;which is code for lower wages and fewer or more inferior conditions. Isn't that just what has gone on, over the past 18 months particularly, under this government? This government, through the national wage case, has attacked the very wage structure of, and restricted increases available to, the poorest paid people in our community, while basically slapping on the wrist with a wet lettuce leaf those in the business sector who, already on an overly inflated base, have rewarded themselves with higher levels of increase than have been available to the rest of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, as I said in opening, is relying upon the market to solve its problems. The outcome to which its policies have led to date, in terms of the labour market, are inequity, no solution and even higher unemployment. It cannot say to this community that it is getting on top of the problem when, clearly, the problem is getting on top of it, as evidenced by lower growth and insecurity. Notwithstanding the solution to the problem of inflation, the only people who are prospering are those who have invested in the share market, because of the relative value of shares as against fixed interest investments with declining interest rates. That is just the phenomenon that we have seen with the variations in the market in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what did Kenneth Davidson go on with in his article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>? He went on and said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What can be said with certainty is that all these reforms are leading in one direction&mdash;an acceleration of the redistribution of income and power from wage earners to the owners of capital and most property. (Aboriginal property rights are extinguishable)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is also certain is that tax avoidance is based on transmuting taxable income into non&hyphen; taxable expenses or capital gains by the clever alchemists in the legal and accounting professions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, these are the sorts of tax advantages that are available to those people who have higher disposable income, and that sort of advice far outweighs any advantage that might be available to the ordinary wage and salary 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4998"> earner who sees their tax taken when their pay is paid to them. And this is the environment in which the market is supposed to provide the solutions. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those who are about to be dudded in the name of tax reform&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">read `those PAYE taxpayers and ordinary wage and salary earners'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">should remember who was treasurer the last time tax avoidance and evasion spread across the country like a commercial plague. The Fraser Government, with Mr Howard as Treasurer, failed to do anything about tax avoidance&mdash;which eventually degenerated into evasion (bottom&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;harbour) in the late 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard ignored the evidence put before him of the gaping hole in government revenue (paying tax seemed to become voluntary for the rich) until the Costigan Royal Commission exposed the whole stinking mess.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One wonders, with advice that this government and the previous government received from the tax office about tax rorts with some of the richest people in Australia, what has become of the report. Over the period of this government we have heard virtually nothing about the pursuit of the tax receipts that the government is forgoing, alleged by the tax office to be down to some schemes that are available to the very rich. That tax has been forgone when there should be attention to collecting it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened? I do not know. I have not heard of anything that this government has done to recover that money. So the reference to what occurred with the Fraser government is apposite to what this government is doing in relation to these bills. What is it going to do about the collection of revenue to pay its bills? Who is it going to get the money from? All we hear spoken about is tax reform, not reforming the law properly as it is but some new scheme&mdash;a goods and services tax&mdash;which this government wants to impose on all of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government knows that it is the poorer people who do not have disposable income, who spend their money and therefore will be taxed on all of their expenditure. It is the more well&hyphen;to&hyphen;do people, particularly those who can find the tax lurks, loopholes and avoidance schemes, who will not pay their share of tax. It is no different from today. A 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> GST in terms of tax reform is not a solution. This government should come clean in relation to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose if we look at the form guide of the previous coalition government, the Fraser government, on that sort of track they do not run very well. Kenneth Davidson states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Who really believes that unemployment can be solved by a combination of policies that cut meagre income support for the unemployed, drives industrial relations back into the master/servant relationship of the 19th century, skews the tax burden from the rich to the poor, reopens loopholes for tax avoidance and cuts spending on human infrastructure in the form of labor market programs, government schools, TAFE and higher education?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a mean, spiritless, business, bureaucratic and political elite that peddles policies designed to improve their incomes, their security and their sense of self-worth at the expense of the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Davidson finishes with this passage:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But this elite is not completely dull&hyphen;witted.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth while recalling that we could only get John Howard, the Leader of the Opposition at that time, to make broad speeches. He said those broad speeches were very important. I recall headland speeches. He made one to the Menzies Research Centre in June 1995. You will recall the emphasis put  on the headland speeches because it was only in the last three weeks of the election campaign, when people were overloaded with political campaigning, that some of the detail of the opposition's program came out.</PARA>

He, as Prime Minister, has to look to the world, not to the latest poll. We on this

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is particularly serious for my state of NSW because of another development under this government&mdash;a lack of confidence in regional Australia. This government has destroyed confidence in regional areas. As part of my duty as a senator, I pay attention to the south and north coasts of New South Wales. There are great problems in these areas at the moment, particularly with regional unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The city of Newcastle is a symbol of the inability of this government to handle anything effectively. The government has had difficulty getting a minister into the area and the people of Newcastle are consequently very anxious and concerned. They are not being given the confidence they should expect in a time of crisis. As we look through the appropriations, we find that there are, under this government, inadequate industry and regional policies. These are policies that are complementary under any decent government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return to the fact that people are disadvantaged from the cradle to the grave and very shortly after the cradle, nowadays, people are  concerned with child care. This is one of those areas where the coalition had promised to expand choice. I have already referred to the responsibilities of government, made in the headland speeches, which Prime Minister Howard thought were so important, yet he has robbed families with children of choices in child care. He has robbed young people seeking an education or a job of choice. In child care, education and youth employment we have real crises and real disadvantage, and this budget fits into that series of issues that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5001"> make child care unaffordable for many people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite his election promise to `keep child care affordable and accessible', the Prime Minister has taken $821 million out of the child&hyphen;care budget over two years. At the very earliest of ages, members of families have been disadvantaged by this government. Although Prime Minister Howard said before the election that, `Access to quality, affordable child care is essential,' the 1996&hyphen;97 budget cut $500 million from child care over four years. We are now facing the second period of cuts under the Howard coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although Prime Minister Howard promised that, `A Liberal and National Party government will implement a strategy to keep down the costs of child care for parents,' some families have already had their child&hyphen;care bill doubled, with the cost for each child rising by $20 to $40 per week. These are the facts under this government. This latest budget cut of an additional $321 million has meant fewer places and higher fees. You cannot, as this government has done, continue to cut child care in each budget without hurting families when they are at their most vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect of this cut is that families affected by the rising cost of child care will have to decide whether to place their children in backyard, unregulated child care or to have one parent drop out of the work force to care for the children, even if they find it almost impossible to survive on one wage. These are the ideas of the Prime Minister on the issues of choice and opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Teenagers in families fare no better. Recent attacks on income support for young Australians are vicious, to say the least. The dole will be abolished for young people under the age of 18 years; the government has simply washed its hands of these young people. Forty&hyphen;six thousand young people will either lose their welfare payments or have them greatly reduced. While nearly 30,000 young people under the age of 18 will lose the dole, Senator Vanstone says that it is an incentive to find a job or keep studying. Yet, by the government's own admission, the jobs are not there. Sixty thousand people have missed out 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on TAFE places; demand has outstripped supply. I referred to belief in the markets; here is an example of market failure, but it is a market failure created by the government's own policies. Those teenagers who are lucky enough to get a TAFE place face a fee of $300 to $500. Surely, if Senator Vanstone wants to give people the opportunity to study, the first step should be to ensure that places are available and affordable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government sends mixed messages to everyone in families. The government says that it wants teenagers to study, yet it has made TAFE inaccessible and university places unaffordable. The government wants to return to the bad old days when a university education was for the children of the rich and it entrenched privilege. This is the way Australian universities are being forced to go under this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1996&hyphen;97 budget cut higher education by $1.8 billion, putting a university education out of the reach of many low&hyphen;income people. Changes to HECS&mdash;the higher education contribution scheme&mdash;has meant differential charges for courses. This will mean that low&hyphen;income students will choose cheaper courses or will give up on study altogether. This budget cuts $14.3 million from vocational and industry training, and another $72 million from education and training grants to states. That is on top of the $183 million worth of cuts in last year's budget. The government cannot continue to keep cutting in the vital areas of industry training and education for it not to have an effect. Growth in apprenticeships is the perfect example&mdash;the number of apprenticeships have actually fallen. The rate of growth in traineeships fell from 117 per cent in Labor's last year in office to 68 per cent during Prime Minister Howard's first year in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment has grown steadily since this government came to power. The government says that it wants teenagers to get jobs, yet they have cut employment programs that have been proven to work. If there is one issue that I feel Australians should be angry about, it is that in last year's budget the government cut more than 230,000 training 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5002"> places by taking $1.8 billion from labour market programs. That was a significant reduction in a proven way of tackling the problem of long&hyphen;term unemployed people. It is little wonder that the unemployment rate has risen to 8.8 per cent while the growth rate is 3&frac34;per cent. We know it is far lower than the four per cent growth which is the minimum requirement to tackle unemployment. These figures represented a fall of 40,000 in the number of jobs in May, wiping out all the growth of the last six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The depression that exists in people's minds across Australia and the insecurity that people feel in this country are a direct result of these cuts that are occurring. It is not good enough for the coalition government, led by Prime Minister Howard, to try to confuse the issue. The cuts I am describing are of millions of dollars. The programs have gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Next week we will have increased prices for things from the pharmacy; a trip to the chemist will cost more. Next week you have got the next episode in the process of putting a burden on family members. Next week many Australians will realise that they are completely disadvantaged when they have to go to the chemist. Pharmaceutical costs, even for pensioners, will be greatly increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That reminds me of the threat to the older members of the community that this government represents. I do not know of any greater insecurity than that many people face because nursing homes are allowed to charge whatever they can get away with. This is now the government's approach to people who are old. We estimate the average home entry fee will be about $30,000, but could be as high as $88,000. The Uniting Church estimated it could be up to $200,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that, if one person has to go into a nursing home, the family will have to face the tension of selling the family home. For the people in the twilight period of their life in the family that is the epitaph that this government is going to give them&mdash;the threat that they will have to make a decision to sell the family home. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to start my contri 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bution to this debate on the appropriation bills by focusing on the cuts to the ABC, specifically those to Radio Australia. The ABC has had its budget drastically cut by $55 million, reducing its base funding to $468 million. That move ignores the government's own inquiry which recommended that the base funding for the ABC be no less than $500 million for broadcasting networks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why did the government do that? The obvious answer is because the government hates the ABC. It has a real problem with anything that might constitute criticism of government policy. Put simply: the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and other cabinet ministers believe the ABC has predictable views on a range of causes, lacks a prominent conservative commentator and, basically, is hostile to the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is difficult to tell, though, how long the government has harboured this terrible antipathy towards the ABC. Certainly, none of the treatment the ABC has suffered since this government was elected was flagged in the coalition's election policy on the ABC called `Better broadcasting'. In fact, if you read `Better broadcasting', you would have thought that this government was in favour of the ABC, in favour of independent broadcasting and in favour of Radio Australia and ATV in particular. That is what it says in that policy. That is what it says will be one of the things it will be committed to when it gets into government. Well, that is not what has happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In hindsight, it appears that the government&mdash;or at least certain elements of it&mdash;has harboured malignant grudges against the ABC for some time. We should have remembered that the Prime Minister would not be part of the pre-election debates as long as Kerry  O'Brien was the compere. I am sure that all ABC viewers and listeners will remember that next time they vote. Prime Ministers Hawke and Keating also demonstrated their dislike for the ABC when the Labor governments cut the ABC's funding during their terms in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Especially in this day and age, it is impossible to sustain an argument that the ABC and all those who work for it are lefties and, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5003"> therefore, are antagonistic towards the coalition. A more realistic thesis is the one which suggests that the ABC is prepared to be critical of government approved actions and policy, is willing to investigate those issues and is willing to report on them. In short: the ABC upholds its charter obligations by `providing an innovative and comprehensive broadcasting and television service of a high standard . . . that contributes to a sense of national identity and informs and entertains, and reflects the cultural diversity of the Australian community'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even the government's own inquiry into the ABC conducted by Mr Bob Mansfield found that the ABC was not biased. Mr Mansfield, who is now special policy adviser to the Prime Minister, found that the ABC enjoyed a reputation in the Australian community, the likes of which most companies would envy. He recognised the special relationship the ABC has with its audiences&mdash;and its audiences are very large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Mansfield came to at least one conclusion which was based on no evidence whatsoever. He proposed that the ABC divest itself of its international broadcasting responsibilities and concentrate on domestic broadcasting. This recommendation was made without any community consultation and without his inquiry even having it as a term of reference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the time I requested correspondence in relation to RA and ATV be tabled, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) and the Prime Minister had received 574 letters and 357 e&hyphen;mail messages about the closure of Radio Australia and ATV. Not one of those letters congratulated the government on its decision to stop the service; they were all against the decision to stop the service. I did not even ask for the letters, e&hyphen;mails and all the rest of it that had been sent to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). I am sure there are even far more there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Goodwill is spread by Radio Australia and Australia Television throughout this region. RA and ATV help create an awareness in the region of Australia. The divesting of these services is a breach of the government's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy commitment to the ABC and to international broadcasting. Radio Australia in particular is able to provide information on regional and domestic issues in areas where state&hyphen;operated broadcasters provide no independent broadcasting service whatsoever. Those are the sentiments in the letters received by those two ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">E&hyphen;mail messages were received mostly from Western industrialised countries while handwritten letters came predominantly from Asian countries. What we can read from that is that wealthy countries have access to new technologies and access to their means of purchase&mdash;that is not surprising&mdash;and that those living in poorer countries do not share that luxury. But the minister maintains that short wave is a dying technology. That snapshot clearly demonstrates just how wrong he is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several of those countries are run by autocratic and undemocratically elected officials who deny their people access to new technology, such as computers and satellite dishes. Those governments know their power. They are not about to allow open and free access to broadcasting services when the people on those services seek to criticise them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the eleventh hour, the government agreed not to destroy Radio Australia for the time being at least, not least because of the huge demonstration of public support for the ABC from overseas and from within our own shores. That was demonstrated at the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inquiry into RA and ATV. But even so, from next week&mdash;from 1 July&mdash;Radio Australia will speak in fewer languages, with reduced information and with a quieter voice. As one person who wrote to that Senate standing committee inquiry said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will whisper to the world.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Radio Australia will speak in fewer languages because, along with a 54 per cent cut in staff numbers, it will no longer provide the Cantonese service. We also lose the French service. Mandarin, Indonesian and Vietnamese services are reduced. Khmer and Tok Pisin services are retained, but only because the ABC itself stepped in with funding for them&mdash;and goodness knows where it got that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5004"> from. The government wanted to retain English and Tok Pisin only, ignoring the pleas from foreign governments to retain greater services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">RA will speak in a quieter voice because the most powerful of the short&hyphen;wave transmitters&mdash;the one on the Cox Peninsula in Darwin&mdash;will be closed down from 30 June 1997. The minister made this decision happily because:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . when I discovered that the service could be mothballed and reopened at very short notice, it became apparent to me that we were able to proceed with the original proposal&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is to close down that service&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but still accommodate any subsequent interest that might be registered.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Is that a good enough reason to shut down the Cox Peninsula transmitter? No, of course it is not. The government has spent almost $12 million in the past five years on this world&hyphen;class short&hyphen;wave facility. The world's major international broadcasters know its value, and are literally queuing up in the hope of leasing transmission time for access to the region. And Australia is moving out so the government can save $1.6 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is also saving $3.5 million by the sale of Australia Television. By closing our international broadcasting service, as we are, we are symbolically pulling up the drawbridge. It must cause concern that this affluent nation, seeking its place in the region as a friendly neighbour and a host, as a trading partner and as an honest broker, cannot afford to maintain or expand the cheapest and most effective form of public diplomacy that we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) claims that Australia is committed to the region in the long term, but even his plea to maintain Radio Australia could only guarantee funding for this financial year. What will happen next year is anybody's guess. The foreign affairs minister also claims that some people are promoting an insular Australia&mdash;inward&hyphen;looking, narrow&hyphen;minded, and separate from the region. Was he thinking of some of his own cabinet colleagues when he said that? I would suggest yes. Or was he thinking of his own department's budget cuts?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, Australian overseas aid has been cut by 13 per cent over two years, resulting in the lowest overseas  development aid to GNP ratio in living memory. This budget's three per cent overall cut masks the huge cuts to the neediest regions. Aid to Africa has been cut by 13 per cent, totalling 25 per cent over two years. South Asia, the region with the largest number of poor, has been cut by 18 per cent over two years. Aid to UN development agencies, such as UNICEF, the UN Development Program and the UN Environment Program, has been drastically cut over the last two years. Australia's withdrawal from UN agencies reflects a lack of commitment to international cooperation in resolving complex global issues. These cuts, and other budget policy decisions, create a picture of a country with a reduced commitment to equity, to our region and to multilateral solutions to global problems. And, of course, that is not just in the ABC or DFAT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the statutory authority with a mandate to promote respect for, and observance of, human rights is primarily responsible for administering the Commonwealth's anti&hyphen;discrimination legislation. Central aspects of HREOC's functions include the handling and conciliation of discrimination complaints, education and advocacy, research into systemic forms of discrimination, and advising governments on legislation and policy affecting human rights and discrimination issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">HREOC is also responsible for overseeing Australia's obligations under seven key international human rights instruments. HREOC's budget has just been slashed by 43 per cent over the next two years. You have to ask yourself if it is because the government does not want to hear from those agencies  that do not agree with it. It does not want to hear from an agency that suggests that the Wik plan may contravene our international obligations. It does not want to hear that the position of women, the disabled, Aboriginals and those of a non&hyphen;English speaking background is not any better under this government's restrictive budgetary measures. It does not want to hear that the number of race 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5005"> complaints has dramatically increased since the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and the race issue became prominent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a healthy functioning democracy, we should place great emphasis on institutions and organisations that monitor and protect human rights. In international terms, Australia has had a relatively good human rights record. One of the reasons for that is that we used to be universally acknowledged as having an independent commission that could administer and inquire into laws that monitor and protect against abuses. Human rights abuses do not just include violence, discrimination or vilification, although they certainly do include those things. They also include ignoring people and not catering for their needs. It is a sad indictment of our political system that those groups which seem to have the loudest and the best&hyphen;funded voices are the ones that appear to have more access to government. HREOC exists for all Australians and is especially needed by those who are not necessarily loud or well funded. The recent cuts to HREOC will serve only to limit its role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now becoming clear through questioning at estimates hearings exactly what these cuts will mean to Australia's human rights watchdog. In real terms, the cuts will exponentially increase the delays in the handling of complaints of discrimination. There will necessarily be an abandonment of major research and development projects directed at reducing and eliminating discrimination and abuse of those classes of persons protected by federal human rights and anti&hyphen;discrimination law. There will be an abandonment of or, at the very least, a significant reduction in the public educational activities directed towards reducing and eliminating discrimination and abuses of those classes of persons protected by federal human rights and anti&hyphen;discrimination law. There will be a loss of 60 skilled and experienced staff from the commission. The Australian Democrats are disgusted by the cuts to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude by adding my support to the views of People with Disabilities (NSW). 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> In a letter to Senator Allison, that organisation wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that the cuts are motivated by an unstated policy of the government to dismantle those structures which protect the rights and interests of vulnerable minorities within the Australian community. Indeed, it is difficult to resist the view that the severity of the cuts constitute a `punishment' of the Commission by the government for its entirely proper criticisms of federal government policies adversely affecting the rights and interests of protected classes, in particular refugees, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I could not agree with that more. It must appear to anyone watching from outside the cabinet room that this government does not work by policy. It works by prejudice, by polling and by personal vindictiveness. I hope I am wrong, but it certainly looks like that to me.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In closing the second reading debate on the appropriation bills for 1997, I would like to thank all senators who have contributed to the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the debate last night I did hear a comment made by Senator McKiernan&mdash;I think it might have been just before a quorum was called&mdash;that the budget for 1997&hyphen;98 was so bad that no coalition senators wanted to contribute to the debate on it. I know it was a fairly frivolous remark by Senator McKiernan, who has a very well developed sense of humour which I appreciate as much as most. For the record, coalition senators have shown great restraint in speaking on government legislation over the last few months in order to ensure that a very heavy legislative reform program finds passage through the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many other senators in this place from the opposition party, the minor parties and the  Independents have a lot of speaking opportunities. But coalition senators, in the interest of getting the government's legislative program through the Senate, have on almost all occasions refrained from speaking in the second reading stage debates and in most committee stage debates. In my role as Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, I particularly thank coalition senators for their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5006"> support. We could not have achieved the government's legislative program if all senators wanted to speak on all the bills. I thank coalition senators for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that coalition senators like me have worked most of their adult lives trying, firstly, to get into parliament and, secondly, trying to get the coalition to government so that we could change Australia's direction, and particularly so that we could change the direction that Australia had gone down over the past 13 years under the control of the Australian Labor Party government. All coalition senators are very proud of the direction that has been put in place by the budgets brought down in August last year and in May this year by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and this government. These appropriation bills form part of the delivery thereof.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened to almost all the speeches in the second reading debate; not always in the chamber, but glued to the television monitor in my office. I listened to many of them and, of course, I had officers present to monitor the debate. However, I did not note&mdash;I may have missed a couple of bits; I am sure Senator Sherry or others will remind me if I have&mdash;anyone proposing any cuts to government expenditure. A range of speakers said that we should not have cut. In fact, virtually every single cut, every expenditure reduction and every bit of fiscal consolidation has actually been opposed by a range of speakers from the Australian Labor Party, the Democrats, the Greens and others. I think they virtually opposed every single piece of fiscal consolidation which the 1997 budget puts in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many senators who spoke on these bills actually proposed greater spending in a number of areas. None of them said how that might be paid for, although I did note that former Senator Gareth Evans made some comments to the media some time ago when tax reform was first raised as an issue. He said that he thought that Australia was under taxed in world terms. I suspect that former Senator Evans, now the shadow treasurer, was alluding to potential tax increases. I must say that if all the wish lists of the Labor Party senators who contributed to this debate were 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> put into the policy paper that Mr Gareth Evans is developing, there would have to be either tax increases or significant increases in Australia's debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really do suggest that if Australians want to see what the Australian Labor Party or the Greens or the Democrats stand for at the moment, they should go through these speeches on the appropriation bills and list all the areas that show where the coalition should not have made cuts and, indeed, where there should be increased expenditure. If people thought we had a problem when we inherited the $10 billion deficit, then they would have to add on the billions of dollars of spending proposed during the last few hours of this appropriations debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With that sort of policy of increasing spending no savings would be made. No&hyphen;one who spoke in the debate advocated any savings or advocated where we should have made some cuts. With that approach the deficit would increase quite significantly&mdash;by some billions&mdash;the $10 billion we inherited, and the interest rate reductions we have had would not have been possible because of fiscal consolidation. We would not have been able to repay $5 billion worth of debt and, of course, that would hurt the small to medium businesses we are trying to help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We suggest to the Australian people that it is never going to be easy to try to save $10 billion. It is never going to be easy to turn the massive deficit that we inherited from Mr Keating and Mr Beazley into a surplus after three years, which is what we are hoping to achieve if the forecasts come in. It is not going to be possible to achieve that without some pain and without some cuts&mdash;it is simply unachievable. But, when we do achieve that goal from that sound fiscal basis, it will be possible for Australia to see the  improvements that we have seen in interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately, Australia will also see improvements in the capabilities of small and medium enterprises in particular to get on with the task of expanding both nationally and internationally and employing young people. In conclusion, I want to respond to the senators 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5007"> who criticised the savings rebate proposal&mdash;the savings measure which cuts the tax on savings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You will cut it? Senator Sherry is suggesting that he does not think that people should get a tax break for savings. I think I heard Senator O'Brien say a little earlier this afternoon&mdash;a couple of speakers ago&mdash;that it was a billion dollar handout for `the Liberals' rich mates'. I will send Senator O'Brien a copy of the survey, if he would like one. If he is listening, he can just call my office and we will send him a copy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An independent survey by one of Australia's investment banks&mdash;I think BT did the study, Bankers Trust&mdash;found, to the surprise of the spokesman, that 79 per cent of the benefit of the savings rebate announced in May goes to people in the $40,000 or less wage bracket. So very much middle to low income earners are the winners out of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again urge people to not listen too carefully to the rhetoric of the Labor Party, to read the fine print and to believe the independent observers who have analysed this savings measure. It is designed to help Australians, particularly low to middle income earners, to  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> give them an incentive to save, to give them a bit of a break&mdash;particularly young couples saving for a deposit on a house or putting money into other investments such as securities&mdash;and of course it is a support for people who choose to invest in superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a good measure. It is a significant breakthrough as far as taxation treatment of savings is concerned. It is not discriminatory. It does help families. It will help small business people. It is a modest measure. Of course, we would love to be able to take it further, but it is in keeping with a sound and sensible budget.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I mentioned my amendments during my speech on the second reading. I will not be belabouring the issue, except to remind the Senate that there are issues of fairness here. The very least that we think should be done on the issue of fairness in this Appropriation Bill is that defence is asked to pull its weight just a little in relation to what other people have been asked to shoulder in terms of cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One specified area of request is that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission be funded to the level it was going to be so that its funding is maintained, which is extremely important at this time. In Australia's history, not for quite some time have we had so many potential problems with human rights. As a country you cannot stand back and allow people's ability to be represented to be taken away in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amounts of money for defence allow some discretionary spending where governments say, `We have to take away this $2 million because of the black hole. We have to take this $5 million because of the black hole.' Well, here we go: here are some funds available, some discretionary funds, for those most needy. Those words have been used. They have certainly been used by Senator Vanstone: `We are targeting the most needy.' Targeting nearly always backfires, nearly always means more people suffer. But there are many people who deserve support in this community, and this is certainly a way that this support can be paid for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have given lots of ideas. Certainly, during my speech on the second reading I reminded the Senate of many ideas for which extra revenue could be fairly obtained to provide for reasonable expenditures and reasonable services without destroying the lives and work of many people. But those options have not been taken. Here is another 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> chance for the government and, hopefully, the opposition to support an issue of equity.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="5008" TIME="5.36 p.m." SPEAKER="Campbell, Sen Ian" NAMEID="H15" ELECTORATE="WA" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not delay the Senate. I do not think Senator Margetts or any other senator will be surprised to hear that the government will not be supporting the request. Senator Margetts is welcome aboard the budget cutting task force. With this earnest effort to cut the deficit and being able to find $200 million like this, I think the Treasurer might even invite her to join the Expenditure Review Committee of cabinet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is a quite serious point here. And that is that defence&mdash;I just note from some material that I have been given by the defence minister&mdash;at these levels has been quarantined from cost cutting in the last two budgets, and for a very good reason. In the early 1980s I took a very serious and close interest in defence policy. A group that I formed in Western Australia to monitor defence policy in the late 1970s and early 1980s used to support the proposition that Australia should have defence spending set ideally at about three per cent of gross domestic product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember back in those days that defence spending as a proportion of gross domestic product had dropped below three per cent and was heading south. At the levels that it has been held at by this government, the $10.4&hyphen;odd billion represents about 1.9 per cent of gross domestic product. So there has been a significant reduction of the defence vote as a proportion of GDP over the last few years. The Australian government believes that it should not continue that trend, that we live in a world where there are changing strategic needs and requirements, and that to reduce our defence capabilities and the vote that is provided to defence would be a serious 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5009"> derogation of our duty to ensure that the defence of Australia and Australia's responsibilities in the region and in the globe are carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further to that, of course, the Minister for Defence, Mr McLachlan, has announced the defence reform program, which over the coming years will see something like a billion dollars of savings in the administration and non&hyphen;combat areas of defence moved towards key combat capabilities. This will effectively, in cliched political rhetoric, ensure that we get a bigger bang for our buck. It will move defence resources from the blunt end to the sharp end of defence. I think the minister is to be congratulated for the announcement of the defence reform program. It will see savings of something like $500 million in the next year, building up to about a billion dollars, potentially, moving out of administrative and non&hyphen;combat areas into combat capability.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not wishing to hold the Senate up longer than is necessary, but I do need to respond to some of the statements made by Senator Campbell. Senator Campbell talked about percentages, but I think if you follow through the paper trail on defence you will find that many areas which might well be related to defence come under different areas. They include, perhaps, industry portfolios or industry assistance in other areas. So if we actually had the total, we would probably be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a lot closer to three per cent than what the official figures are that come specifically under defence. Many of the proposals for Australia's cooperation in other countries ends up coming out of specific budgets. It could be medicine, foreign affairs, police; it could be a whole lot of areas, potentially, if Australia participates in those particular operations overseas, which are otherwise considered training operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we have got to look at it all in the context of the fact that the so-called savings from other departments, for which you read `cuts', go into general revenue. In fact, defence gets to pocket them and to buy more war toys. We also have to keep in mind that it is quite clear that the government have announced that, if they get elected again, not only are they going to quarantine defence while other things&mdash;really important things in our community&mdash;are being cut, but they are planning to massively increase the defence dollar. That has got to be kept in mind. Everybody else is asked to suffer. Not only are we going to be quarantining defence, but in a while it will massively increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the question should be asked: what are the major security risks to Australia? The average person believes that security risks will be created by things like access to resources. It could be inequities between countries and within countries. And these days there are also insecurities associated with environmental damage. There are issues which A</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">ustralia is actually pulling back their funding on. We are pulling back our funding to aid. We are pulling back our funding in relation to decreasing inequities between rich and poor in developing countries. Then we are increasing the dollar for the `sharp end' in defence. So we are looking at the boys' toys side of security and actually closing our eyes to many of the major issues&mdash;foreign affairs and environment and international cooperation. Australia is putting up its finger to many other countries around the world in relation to working out the world's problems, but we are prepared to spend more on trying to be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5010"> technically ahead of the club within the region. I do not think that makes sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">History has always shown that if you start pushing ahead with technical developments in relation to defence, other countries in the region will race to do the same. So what we will get in the region is an arms race. At the moment, apparently the official response still is that it is not an arms race, it is a buyer's market. However, I think that is what we are going to get. Where is the end to that, the spending upon spending for a threat we are not even sure of? Commonsense must apply. We are talking real people here, real issues, not just people's pride, regional pride, as to how much expensive war hardware they can show&mdash;maybe never use but show. I think it is time that we grew up.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The parliamentary secretary said, in terms of keeping the defence budget intact, that in a world of changing strategic needs and requirements it would be a serious derogation of our duty to the region and the globe to cut defence spending. I would like to take out the word `defence' and put in the words `overseas aid'. Then he would have said that in a world of changing strategic needs and requirements it would be a serious derogation of our duty to the region and the globe to cut overseas aid. That is what this government is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, if you ask what sort of strategic needs and requirements Australia might foster in the region and indeed around the globe one of those would be making alternative clean 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> green technology affordable to our neighbours and indeed to the whole world. Amongst that technology would be solar technology, photovoltaic cells and wind power. That can be used at a local level. It does not require large polluting central power stations&mdash;coal fired or nuclear, for that matter&mdash;but it would give those people who are amongst the one billion poorest on this planet and who are struggling to survive some opportunity to move into the age of electric power gadgetry. They could also move into world mass communications, literacy and all that comes with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government is right in saying that changing strategic needs and requirements have to be recognised and that to cut the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5011"> budget would be a derogation of our duty to the region and the globe. I maintain that the priority should be providing our neighbours with the wherewithal to feel that their basic needs are being met and the security of knowing that they are catching, even if they have not caught, the images of prosperity and well-being that they see the richer people on the planet, including ourselves, having when they tune into the village television set, if one is available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet we have the government cutting those very things. We know that it has cut overseas aid to the lowest level in a quarter century&mdash;flouting totally our commitment at the Earth Summit in Rio in 1997. No wonder Prime Minister Howard is ducking the Earth Summit which is taking place in New York as I speak. Seventy of the world's leaders are there, but not John Howard. He apparently does not count himself as a leader. He has ducked out altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is flying from London to Washington and going to twiddle his toes for two days waiting for the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, to get back from New York.

We are not going to have any government moneys going into alternative technologies. The rest of the world is trying to find solutions to the global greenhouse problem. Some 2000 American economists and yesterday some 130 Australian economists said we should move to these alternative technologies. They are sunrise industries. They mean prosperity and jobs. That would be a start to addressing, in a realistic fashion, the awesome problem of global warming.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is this budget doing? It is cutting the pittance that previous budgets have put into this area of Australian expertise. It is pulling the rug from under it. What blinkered thinking. What addled thinking. Let us have a go at it. Let me again take up the words of the parliamentary secretary. Let us be serious about our duty to the region and the globe. Let us even be serious about our obligation of supporting alternative clean green technologies in this country of ours. Let us restore in this budget the tiny amount&mdash;I am talking about a few million dollars&mdash;to bring budgeting on these alternative energies back to $12 million in the coming year. This is an amount out of a budget of more than 1,000 times that amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recommend to this committee that we send to the House of Representatives a request to amend the budget to restore funding on alternative energy in Australia to the level that was evident in previous budgets. I am sorry there is no response from the government on this. To me it is an important matter. Obviously, the Greens are going to get voted down on this but for the government to sit there and say nothing about it just underscores how short of the mark they are in addressing the needs and the business interests of this country in fostering in a small way the alternative energy options that Australia has.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The most important promise that John Howard, the Prime Minister, made when he was Leader of the Opposition prior to the last election was that he wanted to ensure that  Australians felt relaxed and comfortable under his government. I do not know of too many groups left in the community who feel relaxed and comfortable today. In fact, I cannot think of one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly know that parents with young children requiring child care are not feeling relaxed and comfortable because in a week's time the real impact of this government's changes in child care will be felt with higher fees. Parents with children at school do not feel relaxed and comfortable following this government's decisions with respect to funding for school education. Students at university or TAFE colleges no longer feel relaxed and comfortable after what this government has done with higher education, ripping about $1.5 billion out of the sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The young unemployed who were previously working under labour market programs set up by the previous government under Working Nation no longer feel relaxed and comfortable. People in need of health care or pharmaceuticals no longer feel relaxed and comfortable after what this government has done and proposes to do to the hospital system in this country or with respect to the provision of pharmaceuticals for people with illnesses. People working under industrial awards of this country do not feel relaxed and comfortable, nor do people in small business, nor do people with superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if there is one group in our community who deserve to feel relaxed and comfortable but will not any longer feel relaxed and comfortable it is our aged community. They are entitled to feel relaxed and comfortable as best they can in their remaining years. That is particularly true of those elderly, frail people who, because of their situation, are required to be residents of nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People do not choose to go into nursing homes, just as they do not choose to go into hospitals. We all recall years ago under previous coalition governments that many of our aged community spent their remaining days in public hospitals. These people, in the future, are clearly going to be seriously affected by this government's proposals under the aged care legislation that we are now debating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is legislation which reduces funding to the aged care sector. In excess of $550 million has been ripped out of the aged sector by this government since it came to office. This legislation particularly reduces govern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5013"> ment funding for nursing homes. Yet this government has the hide to say that this is a reform package; that this is a package of legislation that is going to improve the position for the elderly in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the providers out there know that those people will not feel relaxed and comfortable under John Howard's government because they are threatened with the real possibility, indeed the likelihood in many cases, of being forced to sell their homes to gain access to nursing home accommodation. The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) and the government say, and no doubt speakers from the government will try to stand up in here and say, that nobody will be forced to sell their own home to gain access to a nursing home. Of course it may not say that specifically in the legislation, but that is going to be the reality for many people out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that there are many aged people in our community who, first of all, will not qualify to be concessional residents in nursing homes. Secondly, there are many no doubt who, even if they do qualify for concessional resident status in nursing homes, will find it difficult to get access to nursing homes because of what will become a limit on the provision of concessional resident places in nursing homes at about 30 per cent on average figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people clearly, whilst they may have an entitlement under the legislation to concessional resident status, will nevertheless find themselves in a position in which, if they want to get access to a nursing home because they need such access, the pressure will be on them to sell their house to find the finance to put up an accommodation bond, because that is the only thing in the future that is really going to guarantee people a right to nursing home accommodation. If you have the money&mdash;the assets&mdash;to put up a bond under this government's legislation, then you can pretty well guarantee yourself a place in a nursing home. But if you do not have the money or  the assets, or you cannot sell your home then you have no such guarantee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we are going to have in the future is a market based system. It will no longer be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accommodation for people who need to be cared for in nursing homes. As I said earlier, it is not a matter of choice for those people and it is not a matter of choice for their families; it is a matter of necessity. Those people are clearly going to find themselves in the position where the market will determine whether they get access or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation will have a dramatic effect upon the availability of nursing home accommodation for the elderly. It will also have a dramatic effect upon those people who work in the aged care sector and those organisations that provide the facilities. This legislation will not, as the government claims, improve access to nursing home facilities and it will certainly not improve the standard of care. As much as this government may claim that it will, it certainly will not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not have to take my word for it. All you have to do is read the report of the Senate Community Affairs Committee to see the views of those involved in the aged care sector. They are very worried. They are concerned about the significant loss of funding that is going to occur. They are concerned about the way in which this government is forcing this legislation through this parliament without proper and adequate consultation and without proper and adequate opportunity for the industry and for the parliament to consider it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation was rammed through the House of Representatives just a couple of weeks ago by use of the guillotine. Debate was severely restricted. Many members who would have liked to have spoken on this legislation, and who were entitled to speak on this legislation because of the representations that had been made to them by facilities located in their electorates and by persons involved in providing aged care, did not get that opportunity to speak. This government has had this legislation floating around now for ages. But when it came to the time for it to be debated in the parliament&mdash;one of the most significant pieces of legislation that this government has put before the parliament&mdash;what did the government do? It stifled the debate and rammed  it through using the guillotine.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5014">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a frenzy to try to get this legislation through the Senate this week, the minister has been running back and forth trying to negotiate some form of a package with the industry and with the Australian Democrats. As recently as only a couple of hours ago, we had the third variation, if you like, on this issue of the concessional resident subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure senators will recall that this has been a matter of debate out in the community for some time now. The government initially offered the paltry amount of $5 per day for the concessional resident subsidy for nursing homes&mdash;a figure which was derided by those in the aged care sector and a figure that really was so low as to be a joke. It was described that way by many in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this is not a funny matter. What we are dealing with here is the amount of finance being provided to nursing homes to care for concessional residents. After pressure had been applied, the minister moved a bit and, on 19 June, put out a further statement proposing a sliding scale. But that was not sufficient either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we note&mdash;and no doubt we will come to this, and no doubt Senator Woodley will address it in his remarks at some stage in the debate&mdash;that the government finally offered to increase the concessional resident subsidy from $5 to $7 per resident in homes with up to 40 per cent concessional residents, and then $12 for each and every resident in homes of between 41 per cent and 100 per cent concessional residents. We welcome that move by the government, because it is a recognition of just what a lousy offer was made in the first place and, indeed, of just how wrong this government has got it from the start in looking at aged care accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, whilst we welcome that move today, we still say that it clearly does not go far enough. It is not $12 as a minimum for every concessional resident in nursing homes, which was identified as the bare minimum that would be required; and it is well short of the  equivalent of $19 or $20 that results from the application of the accommodation bonds and the draw down of $2,600 per year that nursing homes will be able to access; and it is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> certainly well short of what Professor Gregory recommended would be required by the aged care sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time and time again this government have quoted Professor Gregory's report which, they claim, supports their package. But, whilst Professor Gregory recognised a substantial need for injection of capital funding into the nursing home sector, he also made specific recommendations&mdash;and I have already referred to the issue of concessional resident subsidy. However, having claimed support from Professor Gregory's report, this government then proceeded to put forward legislation which will introduce accommodation bonds, contrary to the recommendations of Professor Gregory. As Professor Gregory in his report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The circumstances under which clients seek access to nursing homes are considerably different from hostel clients. Approximately 60% of nursing home admissions are from hospitals. This is one indicator of the fact that nursing home entry is often urgent, motivated overwhelmingly by the need for nursing care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sheer size of entry contributions and the impact on a client's life of having to agree to sell assets to receive care would be a considerable barrier to entry. Thus, while allowing residents who can afford it to pay extra may be the fairest way to provide the extra funds needed for nursing home stock, the substantial increase in the amount that could be paid by allowing entry contributions seems too harsh a measure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Just interrupting the quote for one moment, of course what we are talking about there are amounts estimated to be up to $80,000 or $100,000; there is no cap at all upon the amount that may be set. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even if entry contributions were only allowed for long stay nursing home residents, the emergency entry would mean that issues such as how much might be charged some time in the future are unlikely to be thought through properly when entry was being sought, leaving the resident effectively bound to whatever was agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In contrast, most people entering hostels have time to look for the hostel of their choice, taking into account factors such as how much will be charged."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have read that quote out because one of the principal arguments that the government and the minister have put forward in support of accommodation bonds, and how they will be the great saviour for the nursing home industry in terms of capital improvement, is that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5015"> this is simply an extension of what the Labor government did in the past with hostel accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That argument is a lie. That argument states, `The Labor government put in a similar system for hostel accommodation; all we're doing is extending it to nursing homes.' But what the government fails to acknowledge and state is that there is a clear difference between hostel accommodation, which is a matter of choice for those aged people who elect to enter it, and being in the position where you have to go into a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So do not come at us with this argument that what you are doing by introducing accommodation bonds is simply an extension of what happens with hostel accommodation. It is not. What you are doing is destroying forever the right of the aged who need nursing home accommodation, where there is no choice in the matter, to have access to that accommodation on the basis of need. You are introducing into the system the principle that you can have access to nursing home accommodation, if you can come up with the $80,000 or $100,000 to buy your way in. You have shifted the ground in that area. I say this to the Democrats, who have indicated they will support this: that fundamental shift destroys the principle that our aged who need nursing home accommodation should be able to access it, irrespective of their income and assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a range of other issues in this legislation that no doubt we will get on to in the committee stage. There are many issues still unresolved. For instance, I have received much correspondence expressing concern about the proposed resident classification scale that will be introduced, and the impact that that will have on funding for nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is major concern about the fact that we still do not have any prudential arrangements in place or even out there to be con sidered. How is it going to be ensured that the accommodation bonds will be used for improving capital infrastructure and improving facilities? How can we be sure that the money will be safe? These issues, of course, will come up during the committee debate, and the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opposition will be moving amendments to that effect. But I just point out in conclusion that this is not a reform package which improves aged care; this is a package which ultimately rips $550 million out of the aged care sector and creates a lot of uncertainty, and it will force a lot of elderly people to have to sell their remaining asset, their home.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are debating a package of bills of which the major bill is the Aged Care Bill 1997, and then there are consequential bills which rely on that. It is hard to remember the last time that a package of reforms has caused as much concern and confusion as this one has. The concern of many aged care providers, both for profit and not for profit providers, has centred on the rushed time frame in which this package of reforms has been put together and the lack of detail which for many months surrounded many of the crucial aspects of the broader reforms we are voting on today and in the next day or two.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concern for many elderly Australians and for their families has centred on the impact the proposed introduction of nursing home entry fees, or accommodation bonds, may have on their ability to gain access to high quality nursing home care and whether or not they will have to sell their family home to pay an accommodation bond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has taken the Democrats a long time to decide how we will vote today. I have never consulted as much as I have on this bill&mdash;with providers, consumers, peak bodies in the industry; people whose judgment I trust. It has taken a long time to distil all of the advice I have received, because often it was contrary&mdash;and sometimes, of course, it was not based on the full information which was needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have stayed with this debate from the beginning. We have not announced a firm position at any point until today, because we did want to ensure that we understood fully what was being proposed and that we were able to get assurances from a majority of providers, peak bodies and consumers whose advice we trusted that this was going to meet their needs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5016">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had to weigh up carefully the various arguments, both for and against the introduction of a nursing home entry fee, and on the move towards greater reliance on user pays for residential aged care. In forming our final position on the reforms contained in this legislation, we have relied very heavily on the advice given to us by organisations and individuals involved in the area of aged care. But we have been especially concerned that those paying accommodation bonds would go to the head of the queue&mdash;in this debate, what we term the two&hyphen;tier system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since these reforms were first announced in the 1996 budget, we have had ongoing discussion with the Minister for Family Services, Judi Moylan, and during these meetings we have regularly raised the concerns of the various organisations involved in the provision of aged care and the concerns of many elderly Australians. We do want to ensure that those at the bottom at the end of their lives are not forced to stay at the bottom but that there is some equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past 10 months, the minister has consistently stressed that the purpose of many of these reforms, and the introduction of nursing home entry fees in particular, is to address the chronic shortfall in nursing home capital infrastructure funding which was identified in the Gregory report in 1994. She has also stressed that the residents who meet the `financially disadvantaged person' criteria will not be required to pay an accommodation bond and that the family home will not be counted in determining whether a person can pay an accommodation bond if a spouse or dependent child is living at home or if a carer or close family member&mdash;that is, father, mother, sister, brother, child or another person who, in the secretary's opinion, should be treated as a close family member&mdash;has been living in the home for at least five years and is eligible for a pension or benefit themself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats agree with the government when they say that there is an urgent need to find a way to address the massive shortfall in capital funding for nursing home infrastructure. On this there can be no dispute, as the problem was clearly spelt out in 1994 by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Professor Gregory. The Gregory report highlighted the poor physical condition of the present nursing infrastructure. And I must point out that there is general agreement throughout much of the aged care sector that the lack of capital funding, in particular, for nursing homes, estimated to be approximately $800 million, identified by Professor Gregory constitutes nothing less than a crisis which must be urgently addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Gregory highlighted, 40 per cent of nursing home stock does not meet basic fire standards. In addition, many other nursing homes are skating pretty close to the edge: many have insufficient space, or staircases which are too narrow; and many residents have to share a room with four or five other residents and thus have little privacy. That state of affairs is simply not good enough. This government has been faced with a real crisis and the need to do something about it urgently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1995 Australian Law Reform Commission report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The coming of age</EMPHASIS>, pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number and proportion of older people in Australia is steadily increasing with this increase being particularly significant for people over 75 years of age . . . lt is estimated that by the year 2051&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By 2051. The report continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . 22% of the population will be over 65 years of age and nearly 11% over 75 years. The likelihood of disability, including dementia, increases substantially as people get older.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">With Australia's population aging, this situation is not one we can afford to ignore any longer. Something clearly has to be done. The huge problems with nursing home capital infrastructure are only going to get worse unless we do something to address these problems now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been interesting over the course of this debate to see just how quick the opposition has been to condemn the government for failing to address this funding crisis. When considering the highly adversarial stance the ALP has taken on these reforms, let us not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5017"> forget for one moment that, when they were in government, the ALP also had plenty of opportunities to address this shortfall in capital funding. But did they? No, not in any adequate way. They failed to effectively address this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do give them credit, however, that they introduced additional recurrent funding in 1991&hyphen;92 to be paid over a 10-year period but, as Gregory noted in his report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Very few of the projects which were approved for funding ever went ahead. Of the 210 upgrading projects approved in 1992-93 for example only eleven were completed and only seven nursing homes were replaced over a three year period.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That means we were going backwards. As Gregory pointed out in 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This low level of actual building suggests that the private sector does not consider the proportion of the cost met by the funding sufficient to justify the contribution required although the number applying indicates an interest in improving stock.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on further to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless the attractiveness of the funding is increased it would not be used and there would be little improvement in stock.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As the attractiveness of the funding was not increased, we seem to have here, once again, yet another case of the pot calling the kettle black.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to accommodation bonds, the Democrats' main concerns have always been how this measure will affect the standard of care which is available to financially disadvantaged nursing home residents. One of our greatest fears has always been that the introduction of nursing home entry fees may actually lead to two tiers of nursing home care with one standard of care for the rich and one for the poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has consistently said that a two&hyphen;tier system in nursing home care will not develop because they will pay nursing home operators an additional subsidy for financially disadvantaged residents, and that  this subsidy will make financially disadvantaged residents as attractive to nursing home operators as those who can afford to pay an accommodation bond. I, for one, had high hopes that this would in fact be the case. But I was disappointed on 26 May when the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government announced that the additional subsidy they would pay nursing home operators for financially disadvantaged residents would be a meagre $5 a day&mdash;not enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nearly all nursing home operators condemned the government for this $5 a day subsidy, including those groups which have actively cooperated with the government and worked closely with the minister to try to ensure that the final package of reforms is a workable one. The Uniting Church described the $5 subsidy as, `An insult to our elderly and a slap in the face for charitable providers.' Other organisations, such as the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association and Anglicare, clearly stated that this $5 a day subsidy is `likely to foster a two&hyphen;tiered system in aged care'. Many organisations stated that, in order to prevent two tiers of nursing home care emerging, they would need a subsidy much closer to the $12 a day recommended in the Gregory report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many organisations were also worried at some of the details of the new resident care classification and funding structure, which the minister also announced on 26 May. In response to widespread industry condemnation of the $5 subsidy, on 19 June the minister announced that the government would pay nursing home operators a sliding subsidy scale for concessional residents. However, once again the industry rejected this saying that, even at this new level, the development of two tiers of nursing home care would still be inevitable. By 20 June things between aged care providers and the government had pretty well reached a stalemate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many aged care providers were publicly saying that they had reached a point where they would have no choice but to reluctantly oppose the government's whole package of aged care reforms. Late last Friday the Democrats brokered a series of meetings between the minister and the major church residential age care providers. I have to say, and let me put it on the record, that we do have a different kind of minister in Judi Moylan. The Democrats have not always had a very helpful relationship with some government ministers, but I commend Judi Moylan for her willingness and staying power to continue negotiat 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5018"> ing and meeting&mdash;we were on the phone from Friday evening until today&mdash;with the industry. It is important that that be put on the record.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the committee further considers the Senate's amendments to this bill which have been disagreed to by the House of Representatives, I should draw attention to a potential complication. This is the situation which arises if there are equally divided votes on questions to determine whether the Senate insists on its amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Senate amendments to a bill first introduced in the House of Representatives are disagreed to by the House, the Senate has to decide whether to insist on its amendments. The standing orders provide for alternative motions to be moved to determine that question, but the substantive result is not affected by the form of the motion.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5023">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a vote is taken on that question, and the votes are equally divided, the ruling of President Sibraa of 21 October 1993 applies. That ruling was upheld by a majority of the Senate  at the time and subsequently by a unanimous report of the Procedure Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ruling distinguishes between two types of amendments. The first type, which has been called type A, is a Senate request for an amendment or a Senate amendment which consists of an alteration to the text of a bill. Equally divided votes on the question whether the Senate insists on such a request or amendment means that the request or amendment is lost and the bill proceeds without it. The rationale of this is that such a request or amendment requires a majority to be carried in the first instance, and the equally divided vote indicates that the request or amendment no longer has the support of a majority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other type of amendment, which has been called type B, takes the form of striking out a self&hyphen;contained item in a bill. An equally divided vote on the question whether the Senate insists on such an amendment means that the amendment is insisted on. The rationale of this is that such an amendment can be made by an equally divided vote in the first instance, as every such item in a bill must be carried by a majority, and the subsequent vote would indicate that the item still lacked majority support. Examples relating to this bill are as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senate amendment No. 1 to the bill inserted a new item. It is therefore a type A amendment. This amendment required a majority to be carried in the first instance. An equally divided vote on the question whether the Senate insists on this amendment would indicate that the amendment now lacks majority support and the Senate would therefore not insist on the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senate amendment No. 2 to the bill strikes out a clause of the bill. The question put by the chair was that the clause stand as printed. This question was negatived. It could have been negatived by an equally divided vote, indicating that the clause lacked majority support, and the clause would have been left 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> out by such a vote. This is therefore a type B amendment. If the question to determine whether the Senate insists on this amendment is negatived by an equally divided vote, this will indicate that the clause still lacks majority support and the Senate insists on leaving out the clause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following this statement there is an attachment which lists whether each Senate amendment to the bill which has been disagreed to by the House of Representatives is a type A or a type B amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A complication arises if the Senate's amendments to a bill consist of a mixture of type A amendments, amendments to the text, and type B amendments, striking out self&hyphen;contained items. This is the situation with the bill now before us. When the Senate determines whether to insist on its amendments, an equally divided vote means that the type A amendments, amendments to the text, are lost, while the type B amendments, amendments striking out items, are maintained. If that situation arises the Senate may wish to consider its position and, in particular, to consider whether it wishes some amendments to proceed in the absence of others.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the committee does not insist upon the amendments disagreed to by the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would like to deal with this matter on the basis of addressing the electoral system which the Senate insists that the government adopt for the election of delegates to the convention, because that is what we now have&mdash;not the government's preferred system but the opposition parties' preferred system for electing delegates to the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate is telling the government that we cannot have this convention unless the election of delegates is conducted on a compulsory attendance ballot using the normal Senate style ballot paper. That is the position we now find ourselves in. Without taking too much time, I want to address my remarks to the system which the Senate insists that we use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I want to address the Senate ballot paper issue and urge you again to think about the practicality of that. We have no ideological hang&hyphen;up on this. We are trying to deal with this in a practical way. We, as a govern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5025"> ment, came to this issue on the basis of discussions with the Electoral Commission on the sort of election we could find ourselves in. With 20 positions available in New South  Wales, 16 in Victoria and 13 in Queensland, this is a much bigger show than even a full Senate election. It involves a situation where candidates would be elected to positions for just 10 days, not for six years as is the case in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, we must plan on the basis of the possibility of enormous interest in it. And particularly in New South Wales, there is a lot of interest in this issue. My office has been inundated with queries about the process, the election and becoming a candidate. I said to the government, `We are going to have to plan for an election that could have anything up to 500 candidates. How are we going to deal with that?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is realistic. There are 20 positions in New South Wales. You only need 20 teams of 20 running for election and you have 400 candidates. There has been nothing like that in any Senate election. Frankly, the Senate system cannot cope with that sort of election. The proposition that the Senate is insisting on, that it be the normal Senate system, could make this an absolute shambles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the Proportional Representation Society of Australia, which I trust you all treat as reasonably neutral in this debate&mdash;apart from its obvious advocacy of proportional representation, but we are proposing a proportional representation election&mdash;has written to a number of senators. In its letter, the society said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that the government's efforts to cater for the possibility that very large numbers of candidates will nominate in some states are quite reasonable . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . experience in the most recent New South Wales legislative council election and the first ACT election using the discredited and discarded d'Hondt scheme shows that the Senate type ballot paper becomes extremely unwieldy when around 100 candidates nominate. There would be utter pandemonium if 200 or more candidates came forward. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the Proportional Representation Society of Australia is endorsing our system. It is warning the Senate, as I do, that the adoption of the full Senate system could be an utter shambles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We as a responsible government have had to plan for a situation where not 200 but 500 candidates might nominate. I remind you that the Electoral Reform Society and Malcolm Mackerras&mdash;whatever you might think of him&mdash;have both endorsed the system we have proposed and do so from, I think, a more neutral corner than any of us in relation to this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Senate insists on this amendment and we were to have an election on the basis of the full Senate election system, we could have a ballot paper one metre long by half a metre wide. It could be twice the size of the ballot paper used in 1989 ACT election, where, as you all know, it became a joke. It has the incidental fact of costing considerably more for the scrutiny as well as taking eight to 10 weeks merely to count. We are electing delegates to be there for 10 days, but it is going to take up to 10 weeks to count it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Below&hyphen;the&hyphen;line voting in such situations, according to the Senate system and on the amendments you have proposed, would be extremely difficult. If there are, say, 400 candidates, to have a formal vote you have to number from one through to 400 below the line without making a mistake. I suspect that those voting below the line will suffer a very high risk of casting an informal vote. For all those reasons, that element of the Senate's proposed electoral system is unacceptable to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of an attendance ballot&mdash;which is the second of the three major issues that we must address in the electoral system proposed by the Senate&mdash;was not proposed by the government and is not supported by the government. We have allocated some $35 million for the election that we proposed to conduct&mdash;a postal vote. One of the reasons we did so was that it is $13 million cheaper than an attendance ballot. It will cost some $49 million for a full attendance ballot for the election of delegates to this convention.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5026">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not trying to be unduly fiscally conservative on this matter, but we do think that that is not cost-effective or reasonable in the circumstances. For an election which does  not involve a government or a parliament but delegates to a convention, that sort of expenditure is unwarranted when it can be done effectively for considerably less money. So we do think that the cost involved in a full attendance ballot is not necessary and is wasteful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do point out that the postal ballot has the great advantage of enabling us to get into every household in Australia a great deal of information about this election. It is an unusual election and people will be looking for information. Your amendments have had to go to the extent of providing for material to be in libraries and other things. We will be able to deliver into every household the statements of all the candidates saying exactly what they stand for and full how&hyphen;to&hyphen;vote information about an unusual election. We think that is a considerable advantage of the method we have proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have, as you know, proposed security systems to minimise the extent to which there can be fraud, but I put to you that the incentive to defraud in an election like this is very limited. You are talking about statewide electorates of one million people&mdash;that is for my state, the second smallest state. To actually have any influence on the outcome would require fraud on a scale that is unheard of. Labor spent 13 years telling us that there was no fraud in the electoral system so I think it is a bit much to say that we cannot have a postal vote.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am on record as saying that the problem with the electoral system is the walk&hyphen;in walk&hyphen;out electoral roll&mdash;not the method of voting, but the fact that we have no guarantees whatsoever that the electoral roll is accurate. I do not reflect on the AEC in that. Simply, there are no checks whatsoever on enrolment. That situation obtains whether you have a postal or an attendance ballot.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, we are not talking about electing a government; we are talking about electing delegates to a convention with statewide electorates of a million-plus people. The incentive and the opportunity to engage in fraud, I think, are absolutely minimal. We have taken, I think, sensible steps to minimise that in any event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area we have to deal with is this question of compulsion, whether this is a compulsory ballot. As Senator Bolkus honestly and sensibly stated the other day, if you are going to have a postal ballot, it is simply not practical or possible to make it compulsory. You cannot enforce a postal ballot for the reasons I think we all understand. That is partly why we propose that this be voluntary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do think that, in principle, it is not sensible, feasible or reasonable for this parliament to force people to vote in an election of this kind. I again remind you that we are not dealing with any proposition to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act to require compulsory voting; we are dealing with a unique election, an election of delegates to a convention about the issue of the republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it might surprise us in the public domain, there are many Australians who are undecided on that issue. The most recent Newspoll from News Ltd, which is an advocate of change, revealed that 25 per cent of Australians are undecided on this issue. It would not be unreasonable to find that in an election there may be that 25 per cent of people who say, `I am not in a position where I can sensibly cast a vote for either a republican or a constitutional monarchist candidate. Therefore, I choose not to vote in this election but to observe the outcome and observe the debate in the convention. As and when the nation votes on this critical issue I will make up my mind. But I am not ready to do so at this stage.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know we have got 25 per cent of the electorate undecided. That is nearly three million Australians. What you are proposing is that every one of those three million is liable for prosecution should they choose to honour their position of being undecided and choose not to vote. They will be guilty of an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5027"> offence, hunted down by the Electoral Commission and prosecuted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just think that, in the circumstances of an issue based election of this kind where it is not unreasonable that a quarter of our fellow Australians are at the moment undecided, they  should&mdash;free of guilt&mdash;be able to stand back from this election. I would encourage them to vote; I would like them to vote and I would like them to make a decision on this, but to make them all guilty of an offence and to have the Electoral Commission prosecuting up to three million Australians is absolutely unacceptable to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are Liberals, as you well know, who disagree with me about the question of voluntary voting or compulsory voting for federal elections, but even those strong advocates in our ranks of compulsory voting for federal elections support this election being voluntary for the sorts of reasons I have outlined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of this debate has been around the question of compulsory or voluntary voting for federal elections. That is not the proposition before the parliament, and I ask you to deal with it on its merits. I also ask you to note that this parliament and the then Labor government endorsed and adopted voluntary voting for ATSIC elections, and yet we have heard that we must not denigrate or downgrade this election of delegates to the convention by making it voluntary&mdash;that would somehow signal that we do not think it is important. I put that back to you in relation to ATSIC elections. By your own rhetoric and your own actions, you condemn ATSIC and its elections to that status, which is entirely unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have plenty of local government and union elections in this country which are all voluntary, and I do point out that the governments of Great Britain, France, Germany, Canada, New Zealand and, yes, the United States are all elected by a voluntary vote. To suggest that we cannot elect delegates to a convention to discuss the question of a republic by a method used by all the world's great democracies to elect their own governments does seem to me somewhat unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I just make the point in closing that what the Senate is proposing&mdash;and we are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> now dealing in this motion with the question of the Senate's preferred electoral system, not ours&mdash;is that you add $20 million to the cost. This will cost $55 million to conduct.</PARA>

The Senate has also taken steps in the debate on the bill to ensure that the ballot paper for the election of delegates to the convention would be a normal Senate style ballot paper rather than the extraordinarily complex hybrid that has been proposed by the government for the purposes of this Constitutional Convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to say in relation to that that Senator Minchin's arguments in relation to the ballot paper are very flimsy ones indeed. After all, we do have in the Senate style ballot paper a ballot paper that Australians are used to, a voting system of which&mdash;since its introduction for above&hyphen; and below&hyphen;the&hyphen;line voting&mdash;there is a good understanding in the Australian community. You only need to look at the number of people who vote informally now in Senate elections to reinforce that particular point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say to Senator Minchin&mdash;through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, and I made this point previously in the debate and I think it is worth reinforcing here&mdash;that it is wrong to suggest it is an easy system to work through. To have below&hyphen;the&hyphen;line voting that requires voters to go to a booklet that accompanies the material that comes to voters in the post, find a number next to a candidate's name, insert that number in a box on the ballot paper and then, if you wish, to extend that same process to from nine boxes up to the maximum number of delegates to be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> elected, which I believe is 20 depending on the state where the election is being held, is by any measure both a new and an extraordinarily complex voting system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not necessarily argue here that this has been designed on advice from the Australian Electoral Commission to always deliberately confuse voters, but it certainly gives me that impression, I must say, given the fact that Australians will not be used to such a ballot paper. It has been described by the AEC itself as something that many will be used to because it is like going down to the TAB and filling in a betting slip, but I think that is a very poor argument in defence of a new ballot paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition cannot back down from our insistence that the vote for delegates to this convention be undertaken according to what we believe are tried and true Australian electoral traditions. I think that it is reasonable to make the point that the government has used the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997 to experiment with a new voting system and ballot paper, and to fundamentally attack the integrity of the Australian electoral system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the Labor Party do have an unwavering commitment to the Australian style ballot. We think the massive changes that are being proposed by the government&mdash;firstly, changing from compulsory to voluntary voting; secondly, changing from an attendance ballot to a postal ballot; and, thirdly, changing to optional preferential voting in the sort of system that I outlined a little earlier&mdash;are ones that ought not be accepted by any responsible parliament. It would be irresponsible of the Senate to allow the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill to pass the Senate in the form that is being proposed by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said previously that Senator Minchin is one of the very forthright advocates&mdash;I acknowledge that; I acknowledge that he has been a very forthright advocate&mdash;of voluntary voting in Australia. I want to say to Senator Minchin that he has been very honest in that respect. He has not attempted to hide his commitment to a fundamental change to Australia's voting system. I acknowledge that, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5029"> Senator Minchin. I think that when Australian politicians are open and honest in that way, it ought to be acknowledged by those from opposing political parties. You have not tried in any way to play down what I think is an ideological commitment&mdash;I think I can go further, frankly, and say it is an ideological obsession&mdash;in support of voluntary voting. But I do believe that you and some others in the government have tried to use the constitutional convention election of delegates process as a trojan horse to force voluntary voting in federal elections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is reinforced by the recent report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which made a public recommendation in relation to the introduction of voluntary voting for Australian elections and referendums. I must say again that I believe that was driven by Senator Minchin, who has been a very effective henchman for the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in this regard. It does appear to be a very strong commitment of the government&mdash;to the point that that particular report, driven by Senator Minchin on behalf of the government, is now before the parliament and is a matter of public record. As far as the Labor Party is concerned, we believe it is absolutely essential that any attempt to distort, rig or rort our electoral system in this country must be resisted at all costs. We will resist this fundamental change that is proposed by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say to the government that we consider that any mechanism to formulate the republic is of vital importance to all Australians. We say that this sort of change to the voting system&mdash;a voluntary postal ballot&mdash;diminishes the seriousness of the task that the Constitutional Convention has before it. After all, this is the convention, as the government says, that provides the framework of a move to a republic. If the Constitutional Convention is seen as some sort of gabfest where delegates are elected in the same way as you elect Logie winners&mdash;that is, by a voluntary postal vote system&mdash;the convention will not have the standing or the integrity in the eyes of the Australian public that it should have.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the government has to face up to the fact that compulsory voting has been a hallmark of our electoral system since 1924. It ensures a high and therefore representative turnout in our elections. It makes sure that everybody in this country has a stake in the result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in my speech on the second reading on this bill, in Australia voting is considered an obligation of citizenship, just like paying taxes or abiding by the law. It is these obligations of citizenship that promote social and political cohesion in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Labor Party we have always believed that voting in this country is a communal act by all Australians. It is an affirmation of the commitment of Australians to democratic and public processes. Compulsory voting at attendance ballots is the hallmark of our democratic electoral system. We have always said that a move to voluntary voting means that political parties will concentrate their efforts on mobilising the vote on election day as opposed to ideas, policies and programs for government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also acutely aware&mdash;and it is very important from Labor's perspective&mdash;that voluntary voting inevitably leads to targeting campaigns to those people who are most likely to turn out to vote. It is the more disadvantaged in the community who tend not to vote in voluntary systems, and it is precisely those people that the Labor Party believes government has a special responsibility and obligation to. We just cannot accept that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5030"> government's proposition that the election of delegates to this Constitutional convention should be used as some sort of experiment to destroy in excess of 70 years of democratic tradition in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin talks about opinion polls. I read on the wire that there is one published tomorrow, Senator Minchin, a Morgan poll in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>. It says that, of people who vote for your party, coalition supporters, 68 per  cent support compulsory voting. It also says that 70 per cent of Labor voters support compulsory voting. That is perhaps something you might care to take on board, but I believe there is strong community support for compulsory voting. As you have been keen to quote opinion polling in the debate, that is one that we just read about today that is being published tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the arguments that you present in relation to the difference in cost between a voluntary postal ballot and a compulsory attendance ballot represent highly inflated figures. On your own figures, the difference is $13 million. Labor has consistently said that the real difference is in fact a lot less. We believe that it is significantly less than $13 million, but we say that this is important enough, if it is up to $13 million, to find that money in the Federation Fund, because at the end of the day that is what the Federation Fund ought to be about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we say that fundamentally you cannot put a dollar figure on democracy; you cannot actually cost out the democratic process like that; you cannot compromise on democracy. We also say that you ought not be able to change the best electoral system in the world, that is, the Australian ballot. It is tried and true. It is, in our view, the best electoral system in the world, and we cannot accept the government's attempts to change it through this mechanism.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats also believe that the Senate should insist on the amendments before us. The first thing I would say to the government is that they still have a very clear option. The government can still take the compromise option of having their convention with a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> normal compulsory attendance vote. That is the normal way in which Australians turn up on an election day and vote at polling booths.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that would be very sensible compromise for this government to adopt. I think it is very immature to say, `It is our way or nothing.' The Democrats would like to see a convention, but we do not want to see one that is undermined by the processes. Unfortunately, I think that is the risk we run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to deal with some points of refutation: firstly,  Senator Minchin spoke at length about the 25 per cent, the quarter, of his fellow citizens who are undecided and how terrible it was to ask them to decide on voting for a convention. I think he makes the mistake of translating 25 per cent undecided on the matter of a republic. I think he should ask himself how many of those 25 per cent would have a view on `Do we want an Australian head of state?' They may not be decided on the form a republic should take, they may have some reservations about the structure that might follow such a plebiscite, but I do not think it is right to say that 25 per cent undecided means that they do not have a view on the fundamental question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the Democrats would argue that the compulsory vote has within it the elements of a plebiscite. It is the same as in a general election. People still ultimately have to make a choice. And we read in the papers in the last week of every campaign the high undecided figure. But on election day our system asks them to focus and make their choice. And they do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard Senator Minchin in a few interviews now talk about the way in which the Senate&mdash;usually he says Labor but perhaps he is saying the Senate now&mdash;wants to gaol all these people who do not want to vote. Senator Murray has given me the figures from the 1993 election. The number of Australians who refused to pay their fine for failing to vote and went to gaol is 43.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin, I think, conjured up images of two to three million Australians roaming around the country that this government would have to hunt down and send to gaol for failure to vote. What happens nor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5031"> mally is that the Australian Electoral Commission sends them a `please explain' letter, and most of them have an explanation. It is no big deal. This is a pretty desperate kind of scare tactic, which I do not think is finding resonance out there in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard the argument about other countries so many times. We do not have to have a cultural cringe which says, `Maybe we have got something wrong for our country because everybody else does it differently.'  We have confidence in the system which is a product of our history, our politics, our culture and which works for us. That is the important thing, not what America does, with low voter turnouts. Why should it be a problem if we have a system similar to that in one other country with respect to compulsion and similar to that in one other country with respect to the type of voting for the Senate? Why should that be a problem? If it works for us, it works and that is what is important. And our citizens understand it. So I do not think that is a very persuasive argument at all. I do not think Australians have rushed to embrace that argument when it comes to privatisation either. We do not think that, lemming&hyphen;like, we leap off the cliff, just because other countries do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the most compelling argument of all is that we should have a convention that we all own, that we have all cast a vote for, which therefore has legitimacy and authority for its deliberations, whatever they may be. That gives it the authority to go forward to the next step, whatever that may be. Those things are important: ownership, legitimacy, authority, to decide on the fundamental question on the only occasion on which this government is giving us that opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am afraid the Democrats just do not trust the longer term agenda of undermining compulsory voting in this country. You can say it all you like, Senator Minchin, but I am afraid the agenda was exposed in the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, and I think the timing was helpful. I think the Senate should insist on these amendments. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just say again that the government does have another option. It can have its convention.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Faulkner indicated, the opposition does maintain its concerns with the bill. Of course, we hope that other senators do as well. During this debate a raft of legitimate concerns have been raised and traversed here. They are starting to be understood by the electorate. But I think it is unfortunate that the government not only has not taken the chance to agree with them but also has not taken the opportunity to even consider them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the government that I think you are misreading the electorate. We are talking here of an issue&mdash;the republic&mdash;which has got 70 per cent support in the electorate. Roughly 70 per cent of the electorate support a compulsory vote. I have to say to you, Senator Minchin, that many are starting to think that you are trying to pull a real dodgy manoeuvre here. My experience today on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia Talks Back</EMPHASIS> program for one hour between 12 and one o'clock, when at least 30 people called the program, was that only one person supported the government's position. All the others were critical and suspicious of what you are trying to pull off here. Seventy per cent of the public supports a republic Australia and 70 per cent of your members, in fact, support compulsory voting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been presented with the government's most recent position today. They are threatening a double dissolution on this issue; they want to reintroduce it in three months time. You do not really expect us to believe that John Howard is going to go to a double dissolution as a proponent of the republic, do you? I say to you, Senator Minchin, that you are throwing around the double dissolution threat these days like confetti at a wedding. It is losing credibility. To pretend that this particular issue is one that might trigger it is something that I think you would be embarrassed to pursue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have got fundamental flaws with your proposition. We have seen tonight, for instance, in an act of desperation, that the cost of the alternative has been jumped up from 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5032"> $49 million to $53 million, $54 million, $55 million. We had to drag you back from $53&half; million the first time, when you bowled in the figures of a Senate election and a House of Representatives election together in an attempt to mislead the public. The real bottom line difference is no more than $3 million or $4 million or $5 million, and you know it. What you are trying to do is conceal it. People could say, `Why is the government doing this?' One really only has to look at the composition of the government delegation to  the convention to see that you are talking about possibly two out of 16 who are not monarchists. About 80 per cent of your delegation will support and do support monarchy Australia. That is why you are trying to dissemble and manoeuvre your way out of facing the people on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our benchmark is the one that you set before the election, the one that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) set, and that is to involve all the people in all parts of the process&mdash;the beginning, the middle and the end. You have betrayed that commitment. There are 10 fundamental questions that you need to ask. They have been bowled up and you have not even started to consider them. Why a voluntary vote when 70 per cent of the public believes in a compulsory vote, when 68 per cent of your party believes in a compulsory vote? Less than one in five Australians want a voluntary vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are you trying to pull this on? Why a voluntary vote when we are talking about an issue as fundamental as the constitution? What we are talking about here is defining the terms of the plebiscite, something as critical as that. Something which will also flow from this convention will be whether we have a referendum or a plebiscite&mdash;another critical step in the process. Why do you not concede that, on the best available evidence, some seven million people will not vote. Thirty&hyphen;five to 40 per cent public participation is in excess of the average in voluntary voting elections, postal voting elections, in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are you not concerned about the fact that at least 2&half; million people or three million people will have difficulty in voting? Why are you not concerned about those who have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> changed addresses, those 2&half; million families from non-English speaking backgrounds, those hundreds of thousands who have trouble voting and need assistance because of their lack of literacy skills, disability or age? Why do you try to confuse everyone with a new system of voting when you know the size of the ballot paper will be the same whatever system you use?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are you not concerned&mdash;and this is something that all Australians have been concerned about in terms of ballots for parliament&mdash;about the secrecy of the ballot? Why are you not concerned about the security of the ballot? You are not even putting an extra penny into ensuring that, when the ballot slips are posted out and delivered, they are protected. Not one extra dollar will go towards security for the delivery of the postal ballots. Your suggestion that you use a birthday to protect security is open to rorts and you know it. You continue to fudge the figures. The more desperate you get the bigger they get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are you in a state of self&hyphen;denial over the practicalities? As I said last time we debated this legislation, people will have to fold, refold, unfold and fold again to get the ballot paper into the size envelope supplied. We will embark upon a system of stuffing envelopes which really will take us into a national game of origami.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do you continue to exclude the public from basic information? Last Friday was the day on which you were expecting those who were appointed to reply to you and to tell you whether they would participate in the convention. Why will you not tell us now who has accepted those nominations? Why are we not entitled to know? Why are we not entitled to know publicly and widely that for the first time in 25 years the President of the ACTU has not been invited to a national summit of importance? We know that all the appointments are of a political nature. You admitted very clearly and loudly last week that no public servant was involved in the process. All people were appointed by politicians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that there are more problems with your proposal now than there were in the past. I do not think your standover behaviour and thuggery is working in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5033"> electorate. You know, for instance, that, even if 100 per cent of those who voted on your terms voted republic, then only 35 to 40 per cent of Australians would be seen to supporting a republic. You would dismiss it then as an insufficient consensus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate that you floated either no convention or a fully appointed convention as the alternatives. Do you know what is common to both those options? They are both undemocratic. They both deny participation of the public.</PARA>

The challenge is to you, Senator Minchin, and the government to consider what the Prime Minister said. It is clear that under your formula&mdash;and Mr Tony Abbott has already let the cat out of the bag about this&mdash;you have designed a proposal which will ensure that there is no consensus.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have discovered through this process, Senator Minchin, that you have a sense of humour, which is always a valued commodity.

I can imagine future Halloweens with Minchin masks and people being absolutely terrified that the one that got the three million is going to get you too. It goes a little far.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to add too much to what has been said and I am aware that this is a debate which we have had, and had well. I want to say a number of things which I think are critical to evaluate in this debate. The first is that the most important plank of the government's policy is that it said it wanted a constitutional convention. Not everybody agreed that that was the right way to go. There were large numbers of people who wanted a plebiscite first or instead and for the process to follow. However, the Senate and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5034"> the parliament have agreed with the government's policy of a constitutional convention, so you get one out of one. That is what you want; that is what you have got.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also said that they wanted to appoint half the delegates and have half elected. Not many of us agreed with that either. Many of us wanted a fully elected convention. However, the Senate and the parliament have agreed to let you have your way. So you now have two out of two. You said that you wanted a ballot at which Australians could express their views. Well, you have got that too. So that is three out of three.  The only missing component in your wish list was your voluntary voting wish as opposed to the Australian way&mdash;the best democratic practice of compulsory voting. I think you are being somewhat petulant, quite frankly, to be complaining in the way you are when you get three out of four.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then you put up the proposition to the Senate and to the public at large: `But this is an impossible vote to manage.' It does not go down very well because we have been managing elections in this way for 80 years. That is quite a long time. But we specifically asked at the hearings for the AEC to tell us whether could they manage a compulsory attendance vote and the answer was yes. They understood all the problems. The answer from them was that they can do the job. The AEC, the outfit that has been managing all our elections very successfully, the outfit which confirmed your own election to government, say that they can do the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we have the argument: `But our system is kind of unique. We are the only people doing it.' In our parliamentary committee processes there is deceit and the deceit is that committee reports are produced and they do not say in the wording: `The majority of the committee said . . . ' or `The majority of the committee came to the view . . . ' They say, `The committee said . . . ' Sometimes if committees are filled up with people from particular factions there can even be the deceit that a minority is pursuing a particular view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My view is that the deceit with the electoral matters report is that the recommendation for voluntary voting has majority support. It does 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not, not in the House of Representatives and not in the Senate. The deceit is also that very few countries pursue compulsory voting. If you look at my minority report there is a list of 21 countries which pursue a variant of compulsory voting, not exactly as we have it but a variant of it. That is 21 countries. You can say, `That is not so many, not many big countries there.' Very many of those countries are far bigger in population than we are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are about 200 countries, I understand, in the world. You can say that that is only 10 per cent, but only half of those countries are democracies. So 20 per cent of democracies are moving towards Australian best practice of compulsory voting. The list is growing&mdash;more and more people are attracted by it. The problem is that the elite never like to let go, so it is a long, long process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are supporting the progress towards voluntary voting because it will deliver your party a benefit. It is as cold and strategic and political as that. However, let us have a look at some of your arguments. You claim that these kinds of votes go on all the time. You say, `Local government do it and they do it successfully. Why can't we do it nationally on the same basis?' I happen to know of local government elections that have an eight per cent turnout.</PARA>

Some validity, some legitimacy, you are going to get for your convention as a result of that! That may suit the agenda of those who want to leave the system as it is, but it does not suit those who want to see an expression of the full Australian will. We know that on that day they will choose as they choose at an election. Those who say that they are undecided now will choose and they will choose either a republican or a monarchist candidate. When they choose you will know, all of us will know, that is the way Australia is moving. Once that day comes the die will be cast. That is it. You cannot resist it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go back to the arguments for compulsory voting. It is the Australian way. It is well known and understood. The AEC say that they can manage it. It does not invalidate your desire for a convention which is half appointed and half elected, exactly as you have designed it. The AEC maintain that they can manage it successfully. It will deliver a  plebiscite indication as a result of people who vote either republican or monarchist. It is for those reasons, amongst others that have been expressed, that I and my party will continue to vote as we did previously and to resist your intention to reject the Senate amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is faced with somewhat of a dilemma&mdash;whether to insist upon the amendments or not to insist upon the amendments. The motion that is before us is not to insist upon the amendments. It matters not, as was explained by the chair previously, whether the motion is to insist or not to insist. The vote that is ultimately taken will not materially change that particular  decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might indicate now to the committee that nothing that has been said in this particular debate, nor in the period from the previous debate, has influenced me to change my vote. I know that these matters are difficult and are such that there can be genuinely held differences of opinion about them. For example, were we not to insist upon the amendments, what would occur then? It seems that there are quite a number of people who believe that that would mean that there would be, for the first time in the federal system as we know it, a vote which was not a compulsory attendance secret ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Senator Minchin, has stated, this is not a federal election; it is an election for some of the delegates to the Constitutional Convention. I do not want to go over and rehash the arguments that I used 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on the previous occasion, which talked about the need for those elected delegates throughout Australia to be elected on the basis of equality of representations from the state. That argument was put forward by me but not taken up by anybody else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the last occasion, I expressed my disappointment that this particular measure put forward by the government and that aspect of it supported by the opposition, had put paid to the principle that had been adopted by the parliament on all previous occasions, as far as I know, when it came to the composition of constitutional conventions&mdash;that is to say, that there was an equality of representation from all the states. I do not want to belabour that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we then come to is, if the government's proposal is accepted, it does go back to a situation whereby, for the first time, you do not have a compulsory attendance secret ballot. That would be a shame, because it would undermine a system of elections that has stood the test of time in Australia, is well understood by the Australian people and, I believe, well supported by the Australian people. It is something with which they are familiar, they are comfortable, and which they support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anything that would undermine that is fraught with danger. Indeed, the system of voluntary voting, as has been described in the government's original bill, would, in my view, lead to the sort of arm twisting that sometimes goes on in these sorts of polls not only in local government elections but also in some other elections for organisations that I know of. People go to people's homes and ask them whether they have voted and, if not, whether they could assist them with the voting, and perhaps they even go so far as taking the ballot and posting it for those people&mdash;rounding up in nursing homes and all the rest of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we do have to look at what might occur if the government's motion is defeated and the Senate insists upon its amendments. First of all, might I indicate one point for the committee. Senator Minchin mentioned&mdash;I may be mistaken here, and he can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that there would be some 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5036"> difficulty in respect of a compulsory attendance secret ballot for persons who wished to vote under the line to be able to do so, whereas if the voting was to take place by way of optional postal balloting, there would be time for them to vote under the line and fill out all the squares. I took that to mean, difficulty in the time they might think is available to them. In fact, there is plenty of time, as they can stay in the polling booth for as long as they like, but I thought that that was the message and Senator Minchin can correct me if that is not what he is saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, the Senate adopted opposition amendment No. 52 which enabled  optional preferential voting under the line. As honourable senators would know, section 170 (1) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act does include a savings provision which enables a person who votes under the line to vote, in effect, for 90 per cent of the candidates with a maximum of three errors. That vote would still be counted as a formal vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that in this particular election there probably would be a large number of candidates. As I understood the point of the proposal put forward by the opposition, it was on this particular occasion to have some sort of preferential voting. Therefore, as I understood it, that amendment would mean that a person need, in effect, only vote for one person if they were voting under the line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that that amendment has been disagreed to by the House of Representatives, and I am not sure where we are if we do not insist at least upon that particular amendment. If we were not to do so, I do not know whether it would place a serious burden on those who wish to vote under the line. At all events, I will vote so as to ensure that the Senate does insist upon the amendments we have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, one of the things that does concern me is: where to now? What will the government do? It has been suggested to me by persons who are, indeed, of a republican bent: better some convention than no convention at all. Others who are also republicans and some who are persons who want to retain the status quo have indicated to me that, if there were to be a convention, the convention 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should have some credibility. They were quite convinced that, if there were not a compulsory attendance secret ballot, the convention itself would lack credibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a very strong argument and one that has to be taken into account both by persons who wish to retain the status quo and by those who wish to see Australia a republic. It is important that any constitutional convention have legitimacy. I suggest that the response to the government's proposal would be only about 30 per cent; that it would be only about 30 per cent of Australians who would vote in a ballot such as is proposed by the government. I also suggest that that would not give legitimacy to the Constitutional Convention. That would work against the interests of those who wish to have the status quo and those who wish to see Australia a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, of course, as I have mentioned before in a previous debate, the electorate is not divided only into those who wish to see the status quo remain and those who wish to see Australia a republic. There are provisional republicans&mdash;those who wish perhaps to retain the Queen as the head of state whilst she is about. There are others who have various views about how the constitution should go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing does concern me about the government's proposal: it is inevitably going to throw up those people from the fringes who have their own agendas to pursue, including agendas which would disturb and undermine revered parts of our constitution. Generally speaking, apart from a few, I think there is agreement around this parliament. In general, the type of agreement I understand most members of parliament have is that there should ultimately be proposals that the status quo be retained or the minimalist public republic position should be the one to be accepted. I do not believe that, amongst members of this chamber or members of the House of Representatives, there are very many members or senators who have another view.</PARA>

The community wants to see this issue advanced. Even many of those who wish to retain the status quo want at least to see the matter settled one way or the other.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem here is that the government does not have any give. This is not the government's constitutional convention; it is not the  government's process towards a republic. It belongs to the people of Australia and it belongs to the whole of the parliament. If we were to get a resolution here rather than having constitutional constipation, we would have give and take. The government would take maybe a little of the salts for clearing the system and brightening up the mind&mdash;refreshing the liver, if you like&mdash;by looking at some of the amendments brought forward by other components of this parliament and making sure that we moved on towards the inevitable public involvement in the process of Australia moving towards the inevitable republic. But I think we are getting bogged down here because the government does not have any give.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset the Greens believe that the whole of the convention&mdash;and we are prepared to give on the fact that there be a convention&mdash;ought to be elected by the people. But we could not find support on that anywhere. We also believe that, at the same time as the election of all persons representing Australians at this convention, there should be a simple yes/no plebiscite on whether people want a republic or not. That would involve every Australian at the outset in putting forward her or his view on the fundamental question which is at stake here, instead of delegating it to the indirect decision of the people for whom they might vote or leaving it to the outcome of the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the earlier debate I gave the cogent reasons as to why we ought to be following 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that path. It is sheer logic that a convention get a direction from the people as to whether or not they want a republic. Opinion polls show they would get that direction and then the convention could get on with the business of determining what sort of republic and how we get there, rather than bogging down into the slog between monarchists and republicans which will not differ too much from the position we find ourselves in here in the Senate tonight&mdash;people entrenched, people unable to give, no result coming out of that. Maybe we should have the people involved  in breaking this impasse that is occurring here tonight&mdash;if only we were more technically equipped for the quick vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has to get off its high horse, not take unto itself the opinion that it and it alone is the arbiter of how this process will work. Indeed, it will work towards the outcome it wants because those two things are inseparable. If the government is determined it will not have any give on the process, how can there be much faith that it will have a laissez-faire approach to the outcome, either as expressed by the convention or by a consequent plebiscite or referendum of the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So right from the start this process is getting into difficulties because there is not any give from the government. We ought to be able to discuss the various components and make a breakthrough here, but I am afraid that the government is entrenched on abandoning the traditional compulsory voting component that Australians are used to. Quite conversely, it is determined to break with tradition and have a postal voting system rather than attendance at polling booths. It is resolute in not allowing a further panel on what is going to be a long voting paper for candidates which would allow people to say yes or no on the republic and, moreover, it is determined that it is not going to give an inch on its right to appoint half the delegates rather than allocate that right to Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The outcome of this will be a lot of huffing and puffing over winter before there is another attempt at resolution and a delay in the Constitutional Convention until the new year. My point of view is that, if this impasse 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5038"> continues in the Senate, the government should take a good look at itself and its entrenched position and think about whether it is really a matter of saving dollars and cents. It should ask itself whether those arguments are really enough to cover the fact that it is hidebound about this, that it does not want to entertain other people's ideas, that it does not see this as a conjoint effort of the parliament representing the people rather than a sectional decision made by the government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it needs to consider really how best to hand the solution back to the people in whom I suspect newer members of the parliament have greater faith than do those who  have been here for a longer time. If it does come down to a plebiscite, so be it. That may be the swiftest and quickest way to get the whole ball rolling again&mdash;a simple plebiscite that says to people: do you or do you not want a republic? In my view, the whole exercise of a convention is trammelled at the outset by not taking that advice from the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot understand why no other party in the Senate is backing that option. It is such a fundamental one: ask the people at the outset what they want. You are going to have a multimillion dollar vote, so let them tick another box. Excuses about it costing million of dollars more, which the government uses to counter such an option, just do not stick. In the long run, taking such an option will save a heck of a lot of money. I believe that it will save the convention itself&mdash;it will save it from bogging down in an entrenched slog between monarchists and republicans, with a few people wavering in the middle, with no resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember that the government uses the word `consensus' here; it wants a consensus coming out of that constitutional convention. Really, it is going to be a very short&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;mark consensus if the lowest common denominator has to be reached between entrenched republicans and entrenched monarchists. That is what it will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say again, I cannot understand why there is no support outside the Greens in this place 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for a plebiscite at the outset, or at least with this vote, so Australians can break that impasse which we can all see coming down the line. Give them the vote at the outset; trust in the people. That is what this should be. If the other components of this Senate were more willing to do that we would be a long way down the line towards breaking the impasse we find ourselves in tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impasse is going to have to be viewed with a fresh set of eyes by the government over the winter break. All of us, indeed, need to look at whether there is room for movement on this matter. All of us are going to suffer in the eyes of the people we represent if we cannot even get to first base in moving towards the republic, or at least towards the review of who should be head of state, which all Australians have talked about, thought about and become involved in in the last few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not see in this return from the House of Representatives any sign of give or take at all. All I do see is the government saying, `Take it or leave it.' Is that an injunction to the convention? Are you saying to delegates to this convention, `Take it or leave it; tell the other side to take it or leave it'? It is not a good way to go. It is going to take a review in cabinet to help break this impasse. All of us here need to be committed, however, to give and take, to make sure that this process does not go beyond the winter break and that we come out of that with a resolution.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not prolong this debate by making any more than a few closing comments. I do remind the Senate that the government was elected overwhelmingly last year with a policy that was clearly not in favour of a republic. We went out there quite openly saying that it was not our policy to turn Australia into a republic; we thought the current system worked very well and was not in need of change. A number of speakers who spoke in this debate in favour of compulsion said, `If it works for us, why should we change it?' That is exactly the argument we  put to the Australian people and they endorsed us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We also said, however, that we would be willing to have a debate on this matter through the forum of a convention to which half the delegates are elected. That was the policy. It was not to have a plebiscite. We did not say we would have an appointed convention. We could have gone to the election saying that. It would have then been legitimate for us to have an appointed convention. We did not; we said that we would like to have a convention at which half the delegates are elected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming into government we have thought long and hard about how to put that into effect. We think the method we have proposed is most reasonable and sensible. But we now have a situation where the Senate is saying to the government that we cannot implement our policy unless it is exactly on the terms dictated to us by the Senate, which we do not believe are practicable, fair or reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Figures have been quoted about `undecided' and `those in favour' of a republic. I want to make a point about what that all means for any compulsory vote. Newspoll, which is owned and conducted by News Ltd, which is, as we all know, very much in favour of the republic, ran its survey&mdash;it has been running for some time&mdash;in February this year. It asked, `Are you in favour or against Australia 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> becoming a republic?' It found that 47 per cent were in favour of a republic, down from the 50 per cent in June 1995, 28 per cent were against and 25 per cent were uncommitted. Those are the figures that I have been relying on. Most of us in politics regard Newspoll as at least as reliable and accurate as any other polling organisation and, of course, it is one that in this case is in favour of this change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figures revealed that there is not a majority in favour of this change. But they also showed that 25 per cent are genuinely uncommitted about this question. We have therefore based our estimates of the effect of what the Senate insists we do in relation to this issue on those sorts of figures. We do not believe that the Senate has made a legitimate case for this election of delegates to a 10&hyphen;day convention to be conducted on the basis proposed by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of the debate has been about the question of whether or not federal elections should be compulsory. That is utterly irrelevant to this question of what sort of electoral system do we use to elect delegates to the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt the Labor Party and this parliament dealt with the question of ATSIC elections on their merits when that matter was debated. I was not here. But you have put in place a system whereby ATSIC elections are voluntary. Where was the great rhetoric about how vital and essential compulsory voting was in that case? Senator Harradine said that, if you only get a 30 per cent turnout, it makes the convention utterly illegitimate. My understanding is that ATSIC elections get a turnout of 30 per cent. Are you saying to us that ATSIC is utterly illegitimate? If that is your position, so be it, but we have not stated that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it most remarkable that you are insisting on compulsion in this case when that has not been the case in the past. It is remarkable and an interesting fact that the only precedent we have for an election of delegates to a convention of this kind was in the 1890s when it was voluntary. And it was voluntary right through until 1924, when the parliament 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5040"> decided that people had to be forced to vote. I put it to you that it is unduly authoritarian and unacceptable to the Liberal Party and the coalition government to force people to participate in this particular proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a whole variety of reasons, I think that the Senate has failed to convince the government that its proposed method of election of delegates is sensible, reasonable or rational. I therefore repeat that we ask the committee not to insist on its amendments.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME><STATE> (Queensland)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(9.11 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the dinner adjournment I was speaking about the fact that, after some very extended negotiations with the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), the Democrats working with the industry were able to get a number of significant improvements&mdash;not only improvements but in fact wins&mdash;for people who were disadvantaged. I am pleased to be able to put on the record what those wins were.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One is the commitment of the minister to an independent review of the residential classification scale instrument after three months of operation. This is very important because the figures which are coming in from the various nursing homes and hostels give a very uneven picture about how the instrument will work. Some of those people are saying that they will improve significantly in terms of the funding. The majority are saying that, in fact, they will be worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is impossible, without having the instrument tested in practice rather than in theory, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5041"> to really establish what the effect will be. I think it is very important that the minister has said that she will review this after three months&mdash;not to delay it for two years but to virtually immediately take note of the effect. She will put a proposition to the cabinet if it shows up that there is significant disadvantage. I think that is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second commitment is that there will be a wider independent review of the whole act at the end of the two years and then annual reporting to parliament. It is very important that this be an independent review. The minister accepted that. The industry pressed that very hard. The Democrats did have an amendment along those lines, which we will not press because of the commitment of the government on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next commitment given by the minister is a very important one. That was an increase in the concessional resident supplement, guaranteeing a flat $7 per concessional resi dent for facilities with nought to 40 per cent concessional residents and a flat $12 per day per resident for those facilities with 41 per cent to 100 per cent concessional residents. This really means that these Democrat steered negotiations have delivered an extra $40 million per annum into the residential aged care sector. The Democrats also gained an agreement from the minister on the establishment of a complaints mechanism in each state which will deal with all aspects of residential care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am quite sure that some will criticise us for our decision to support this legislation today. We are willing to cop that criticism, but we believe that, when politics is stripped back, the basic agreement reached by the Democrats, the churches and the minister is not only practical but a positive step forward in dealing with the increasing pressure on both capital and recurrent expenditure for this important sector of a caring society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have eliminated the risk that was contained in the minister's original proposal of a two&hyphen;tier system developing where facilities for the rich would become significantly better than those for the less well off. I simply want to place on the record some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> extracts from what the major churches said today.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will have the debate later. I am quite happy to go into that very extensively, Senator Murphy, because I believe you need an answer to that question. It is a very good one. The Chairman of Anglicare Australia, Bishop Curnow, said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACA is prepared to support the legislation in the belief that the government will honour its commitments and will continue to work with the organisation to achieve a better system of residential aged care for older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Here is a comment from a media release by the Executive Director of the Australian Catholic Health Care Association, Mr Sullivan:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"ACHCA wishes to express their gratitude to all members of the federal parliament in their reception to the association's concerns and suggestions. In particular, the support and help offered by the Australian Democrats over the negotiation period considerably advanced our cause," Mr Sullivan said.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Uniting Church said:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I would like to say that there is still a long way to go. I do not think we have solved all the problems in any sense, but I do believe that with this minister, and hopefully with the government, there is an openness to continue the discussions and to continue to work on these reforms, and I believe that will ensure

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In reading the Aged Care Bill, it would appear that nursing homes have disappeared and vanished from the face of this earth. George Orwell would be proud of this bill. It should be called the Aged Care Bill of 1984, not 1997. It is extremely difficult to find the words `nursing care' anywhere in this bill, and I have still to find any reference to `nursing homes' or indeed `nurses'. This seems strange indeed when Australians have always used the words `nursing home' to describe residential facilities that cater for aged people who require a great deal of nursing care by trained nurses. But in the government's Orwellian version of aged care, nurses, nursing care and nursing homes are virtually ignored.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To save $400 million, this government will allow nursing homes, now to be called `residential facilities', to be run by managers with no nursing experience. No longer do nursing homes have to employ a qualified director of nursing who will ensure that professional standards are met. In reading this bill, I repeatedly read references to residential care as if every resident of these nursing homes was merely going there as an alternative place to live when, in reality, they go there because they need high&hyphen;quality nursing care. If they did not need this sort of qualified nursing care, they would go to a retirement village or would continue to lead their independent lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this legislation, there will be dramatically increased costs for gaining admission to a nursing home and dramatically decreased guarantees of the level of care that residents will receive. The previous system was transparent and allowed everyone to have some certainty about the staffing levels and the skill of staff in nursing homes. The new system will encourage proprietors to maximise their profits by deskilling their work force and subsequently downgrading the level of care to residents.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The removal of the audit requirements for the care aggregate module funds means there will no longer be the checks and balances to ensure safe nursing levels or personal care levels. The collapsing of the CAM&hyphen;SAM and OCRE funds into one payment, based on resident dependency, will mean there will be no requirements to employ staff for these facilities according to resident dependency. It appears to be a reckless act by a government that has been captured by the private nursing home owners lobby.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is very sparse on details about the residential subsidy classification instrument and arrangements for training of staff. Senators are entitled to have more detailed information on the implementation details, as is the nursing home industry. The quality of care section of this bill is extremely non&hyphen;specific about what this quality means and certainly does not specify that qualified nursing staff have to be employed. The closest reference states that providers must maintain an adequate number of appropriately skilled staff to ensure the care needs of care recipients are met. The term `appropriately skilled staff' could mean anything. If there are no qualified nursing staff, and especially if there are no directors of nursing, who is going to ensure that the taxpayers' money that the government allocates to these nursing homes is properly spent on nursing care?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is going around claiming that accreditation will take care of everything. But accreditation, at least until the year 2000, only involves the buildings, not the personal care. The nurses union has brought to my attention that the removal of the audit requirements on prospectively funded long service leave for which funds have already been allocated will create a positive incentive for proprietors to make redundant any nurses who have worked for them for between five and 10 years. This is particularly disturbing because people who go into nursing homes require a level of care only nursing staff can provide. This could be because of illness, disease, incapacity or disability. In this bill there is a deliberate budget driven omission which fails to appreciate the health risk to residents in reducing or removing nurses.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5043">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard much about the market forces that will come into play to ensure the level of nursing care will be just wonderful, but this is a fallacy&mdash;there are no market forces. The government has set a minimum level of fees but not a maximum, and will strictly limit and licence the number of nursing home beds it will fund. This means that those with few or no assets will have trouble accessing the limited number of beds because they will not give nursing home owners the same level of financial return. In other words, there is no market; just a system that will do little for those who need nursing home care and are not financially attractive to proprietors. There is no guarantee in this legislation that rural and remote areas will receive adequate nursing home beds. So&hyphen;called market forces will not address that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this year I heard the details of an elderly man in Emerald who had to be moved hundreds of kilometres away from the rest of his family because there was an inadequate  number of nursing home beds in the town. The tragedy of this particular incident was that the man, isolated from his family, died a few weeks later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aged care should never regress to the situation before 1984, as highlighted in the Giles report. This report  highlighted a range of complaints against nursing homes. In fact, some of the photographs of neglected patients with bed sores you could put your fist into were horrifying. The horror stories continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Up&hyphen;front fees or accommodation bonds will cost residents entering a nursing home between $26,000 and $100,000 or more, depending on whether you believe the government or industry leaders. Over five years, nursing home proprietors will be able to keep $13,000 of that up&hyphen;front free. The pretext, put forward by the coalition government for introducing these fees, is that it will allow nursing homes to upgrade their facilities. This is largely based on the Gregory report, which found many nursing homes wanting. If this is really the case, then why is there nothing in the Aged Care Bill to compel nursing homes to use the money for that purpose?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there we have it: the elderly will be forced to sell their homes and pay most of their money to the nursing homes. If the nursing home accepts them, there is nothing to make the home use that money for upgrades and, even if they do, most of the elderly who pay this fee will not even see the improvements if they eventually do take place.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="McGAURAN" NAMEID="WH4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6L6">Senator GIBBS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They will be dead. There is nothing to stop the $13,000, plus interest, because it will be invested, becoming part of an increased profit line. That is an incredibly irresponsible stand for any government to take, and it makes a nonsense out of this government's constant claims about caring for all Australians. Many homes will still find it very difficult to upgrade their facilities. These, of course, are the homes run by the church groups, which always take higher proportions of the financially disadvantaged&mdash;the disadvantaged that the Howard government plays plenty of lip&hyphen;service to, but does very little to assist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report looked at the situation of hostels because they already have entry fees which were supposed to be targeted at upgrading facilities. But, according to the Gregory report, 21 per cent of hostels that are more than 15 years old have not been refurbished, and 16 per cent of hostels, mostly older stock, are currently required by a government authority to undertake capital upgrading. The report went on to say that these older hostels are more likely to contain higher proportions of financially disadvantaged people, possibly reflecting lower standards and a more institutional design. The report also said that there are two overlapping sets of hostels that are a cause for concern. Firstly, those hostels built in 1979 or earlier which have not been refurbished&mdash;approximately 11 per cent of hostels or 8,000 places&mdash;do not appear to be able to attract sufficient entry contribution paying residents to accumulate funds for a rebuild.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, hostels required to have high proportions of financially disadvantaged people are unable to access funds from residents and seem less able to access funds from a parent organisation or from the community. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5044"> Also, hostels with low proportions of financially disadvantaged people receive nearly three times as much in non-operating income than do hostels with high proportions of financially disadvantaged people. With some nursing homes attracting three times the non-operating income of others, the potential to create two levels of nursing home care&mdash;the luxury model and the pauper's model&mdash;is high indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government and the Democrats have apparently come to an agreement about a sliding scale for the level of concessional resident subsidy. An increase over the pathetic amount of $5 that was originally offered by the government of $7 per resident in homes with up to 40 per cent concessional residents and $12 for each and every resident in homes with between 41 per cent and 100 per cent concessional residents is welcomed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But correspondence that I have received from church groups indicates that the minimum amount they could cope with was $12 for every resident. This government has consistently declared that the elderly will be  given a choice, that no-one will be forced to sell their home, but the realities are far different, and no-one has believed the government on this particular point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation sets a minimum that nursing home residents must be left with, which is $22,500. But there is no maximum amount. The better homes will be the most attractive, and they in turn will find those aged people with bigger assets more attractive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an effort to limit their residents to those with plenty of cash contributions, the fees could increase considerably. Without a maximum fee, it will not be long before the entry fee for most will become the total of all assets minus the $22,500. Nursing homes at the lower end of the spectrum will be left with residents who have little or no money to contribute towards entry fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The poor and the vulnerable will be left floundering. Homes that do not come up to the government's standard now and cannot attract finance for upgrading will either collapse or be left with no government support at all. Without subsidies, even the poor 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would have trouble staying in such homes. If a nursing home has to choose between a financially disadvantaged person and a fee paying person, I think it is pretty obvious which choice they will make. If they have to make a choice between someone with a home worth $90,000 and one with a home worth $250,000, they will obviously be attracted to the person with the better assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia, thanks to the Howard government, will end up with two types of nursing homes: one for the haves and one for the have-nots&mdash;in other words, a luxury model and a pauper's model. Equity will simply go out the window.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is also arguing that this is simply a natural progression from the aged hostel model. However, when people enter a hostel, it is of their own choice; they know what they are getting into and have plenty of time to decide whether or not they believe this is a good option for them. People enter a nursing home in a time of crisis. Sixty per cent of admissions are from acute hospitals after serious illness such as stroke. In other words, there is usually no choice in whether or not a person will go into a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the Aged Care Income Testing Bill, I would like to know why this government is in such a hurry to set up procedures for income testing the elderly, while at the same time it has done very little to put in place arrangements for protecting the money that is paid into these homes as entry fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What, for instance, is to stop a nursing home going broke and effectively taking with it all of the residents' entry fees? Where are the trust funds or detailed prudential arrangements to protect these fees? How will the residents of such failed homes be able to pay to move into another nursing home? Where are this government's auditing procedures that will monitor the quality of care and the quality of the homes in general? Will it be industry based or self&hyphen;regulation? Is that how this government is going to protect the money of the elderly?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quality health should be equally available to all Australians on the basis of need. No government should be abdicating its responsi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5045"> bilities to its aged community in this way. The old and vulnerable have already lost access to the Commonwealth dental program, pay more for pharmaceuticals, pay more for home and community care programs, and are going to lose access to the government hearing service. This income testing bill and its associated nursing home fees merely add to the incredible burden that this government is throwing back at aged and vulnerable Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are more immediate concerns, however. Will the fees be increased in future and eat away even more of the disposable income of the aged? Will the nursing homes be allowed to keep more of the entry fees in future?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is certainly pressure from the aged hostels lobby to increase the amount they can retain. The Gregory report noted that the hostels could keep $12,000 of an entry fee over five years. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry groups have argued that there is a need to increase the amount hostels can retain from entry contributions by lifting current restrictions. The entry contribution retention limits are set to ensure  residents can obtain reasonable refunds upon departure and the amount retained is tied to length of stay.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report goes on to talk about the positive aspects of lifting the current restrictions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increasing income from entry contribution amounts would enable hostels with entry contribution paying residents to pay off their capital debt sooner, provide extra income to set aside for depreciation costs, and generally boost viability. One industry suggestion is that the retention limit should be set at 5% every six months for 5 years regardless of the size of the contribution.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I believe this legislation will start a move which will work to the disadvantage of many of our most vulnerable senior citizens. I urge all senators to vote against it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to see that so many people have come into the house to hear what I have to say in relation to the Aged Care Bill. It is interesting to see that this government has taken its usual approach and has rushed in to deal with the problem in a way that is entirely inappropriate. I believe that there is general agreement on a cross&hyphen;party 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> basis that there is a difficulty in the funding of aged care, but certainly this is not the solution that I would consider appropriate and certainly it is not the solution that the community at large sees as the remedy to this problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem of the funding of aged care has been a difficult and vexed issue for some time. Very soon after being elected to government in 1983, Labor chose to examine the situation, and a strategy was put into place in 1985 to deal with the problem. As a result, a major contribution in funding was made towards aged care, commencing at a figure of approximately $1.2 billion and going up to a figure of approximately $2.6 billion in the 1994-95 year, just before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite this strategy, and because of the continuing explosion of those who are seen as the baby boomers coming to an age of dependency, which it is anticipated will peak some time in the next five to eight years, the funding provided by the then government has been seen to have been inadequate. The report done in 1994 indicated that there was a funding hole that had to be filled and it was required to bring a large number of nursing homes to up to an adequate level of funding. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing about the approach of this government is that you would have thought that they had done everything in their power to ensure sufficient funding and to ensure that those nursing homes were up to scratch, but nothing could be further from the truth. During the short period that this government have been in office they have taken every step possible to detract from the state of nursing homes and to reduce the funding available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year, the total funds removed from aged care over four years was $577 million. Bearing in mind that in the last year before the election we put in about $2.6 billion, it is a rather major difference&mdash;approximately $2 billion. That $570 million came from $244 million in reducing outlays on capital commitments, $253 million in reducing subsidies paid to nursing homes for care, and $72 million in reducing funding to HACC, which meant that a lot of aged people who were intending to remain in their homes were 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5046"> having to pay user pays fees for the use of HACC. That meant that a strategy that was originally developed by the previous Labor government to ensure that people were able to remain in their homes and remain independent was taken away and greater proportions of people were being forced to go into nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the bandaid solution to the capital funding crisis that now exists in the aged care sector, particularly in nursing homes? I would like to examine this Aged Care Bill and what it really does&mdash;I would have normally said for aged people, but in this case I will say to aged people. Anyone who has the misfortune to have to enter a nursing home under this bill, if it is successful, will be much worse off than they were previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose that on the face of it these accommodation bonds are not too extreme in that they allow the removal of a maximum of $2,600 each year for a period of five years. But there is one additional factor. Nursing homes are also entitled to retain the interest which is earned on nursing home bonds or  accommodation bonds&mdash;what we in the Labor Party call entry fees. Really, that is where it all turns and that is where it really becomes in the interests of nursing homes at large, at least those who act on a for profit basis, to take as high an accommodation bond or as high an entry fee as they possibly can. Obviously, the higher the entry fee they take from their residents, the higher level of interest that will be earned and the more profitable their nursing home for the aged will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this issue was first starting to be debated in this house there was a suggestion that the figure that was put forward by the Labor Party, that was extrapolated from the hostel industry&mdash;a figure of $26,000&mdash;was dishonest and excessive and that, really, the fees that would have to be paid would be nowhere near that amount. With such strident propositions being put in the Senate by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) representing the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), we had some doubt that the figure of $26,000 was excessive.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sad thing is that it was not excessive. Evidence taken by the Community Affairs Committee at its inquiry indicated that $26,000 is very much at the low end of the spectrum and that fees of $30,000, $40,000&mdash;and, I have been advised, in some cases $110,000 and more&mdash;could be paid. A national survey of hostels indicated that the average bond is presently about $40,000. It has been put forward by the proprietors of nursing homes that they would see it as quite possible, depending on the quality of the nursing home, that bonds in excess of $110,000 could be payable. For the vast majority of people who are entering nursing homes this is a very large sum of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of criticism about the size of the entry fee has been met by suggestions of flexibility. On the face of it, flexibility is always attractive. As is often the case with propositions about flexibility put by this government, the flexibility always goes against those in the arrangement who are weak and in favour of those who are strong. Very much in this case those residents who are entering nursing homes are in a weak position and those people who are running the nursing homes&mdash;and I tend to speak more about the for profit  organisations&mdash;are in a strong position and certainly have the upper hand in negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The flexibility that is often put forward is that those people who do not want to sell their homes and may wish to pay by instalments can do so and that should be desirable for those residents and their families. The end result is that they not only pay an entry fee but also pay interest from the time the bond is due and payable until the time it is actually paid. That means that they are paying a much larger amount of money than they would otherwise pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the only limitation that is placed on the size of the accommodation bond that has to be paid is the requirement that the resident, that aged, ill person who is so frail that they must have full&hyphen;time care, in that position of weakness must negotiate and the only restraint that is placed on these negotiations is that that ingoing resident retain a sum of $22,000 or 2.5 times their pension. Obviously, it is a larger amount for couples. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5047"> Personally, I do not see that this sort of restriction is appropriate protection for people in those circumstances. There is great fear in the community that there will be a situation where the full extent of every potential resident's assets are taken and placed in the coffers of the nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is something even more insidious and which concerns me even more greatly. The system is set up so that there is, particularly for those for profit nursing homes, a general attraction, a profit, in having the class of residents who can pay an accommodation bond, particularly a large one, as against those who are not able to pay an accommodation bond. To some extent the minister has tried to calm our concerns and has suggested that the payment of a subsidy for those people who are financially disadvantaged may, to some extent, solve this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The initial sum that was offered was $5 per day. That is quite a paltry amount. I remember when this sum was first suggested to Senator Newman. She rejected with some annoyance and anger our suggestion that the daily sum was that low. As the debate has developed and time has passed, it has become  very clear to everyone that this is the sum that the government intends to provide to nursing homes to subsidise them for having the good grace to take on these people who are financially disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know there have been extensive negotiations and some last minute wheeling and dealing. I am certain that senators such as Senator Woodley have tried to play a very positive role in this whole scheme. I do not believe that the negotiations that have taken place and the compromises that have been reached go any way towards putting those financially disadvantaged people in the same position as those who are able to pay a substantial accommodation bond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had some fairly long discussions with persons from nursing homes, particularly those from the non-profit sector, who are very keen to ensure that they can continue to provide the services that they have to date to those who are financially disadvantaged. They put to me very strongly the view that the minimum subsidy that would have to be paid 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for a financially disadvantaged person would be somewhere in the range of $12 to $14 per day. Only if this sort of sum were paid would the nursing homes be in a situation where there would be no financial advantage for them to prefer an accommodation fee paying resident over a financially disadvantaged person who cannot afford to pay that entry fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly the $7 subsidy, and the higher subsidy of $12 for a small group of residents when there is a higher percentage of disadvantaged residents, would be insufficient to remedy the situation. I have some sympathy for Senator Woodley. As I said before, I have faith that he is attempting to genuinely solve the problem, but it is my view that by accepting the compromise that has been put by this government he is not acting in the interests of charitable nursing homes and he is certainly not acting in the interests of those elderly people who have had difficulties in their lives, have not been able to save and do not have the funds available to them to pay this accommodation bond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time I have available to me I would just like to reflect on some of the correspondence and the community concern that has been expressed to me. I know it is commonly said that there is great community concern. I suppose the value of that statement has been eroded by the number of times it has been used. But I have to say that it is true in this particular case. I have had more correspondence on this particular issue than I have probably had in the entire time I have been in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer to an article that was printed in the Central Coast <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun</EMPHASIS>, that is around Gosford&mdash;an area where there is a large proportion of retired and elderly. There is also a large proportion of people who are retired but are really just dependent on the pension. A lot of us may not at this stage think about what it would be like to be retired on such a limited income, but I think it would be a pretty tough lifestyle. I certainly would not want to be in that position, and become frail and ill and struggling to find a nursing home that was prepared to take me because I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5048"> did not have the funds to provide an accommodation bond. The article states:</PARA>

I certainly do not believe that that small change will remedy the problems. I have a letter from Bowden Brae Retirement Village in Normanhurst on the corner of Pennant Hills Road.

I would hazard a guess that probably every member of both the Senate and the House of Representatives would have received letters and had contact in much the same vein because this bill does not resolve the problem that exists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We concede that for essentially demographic reasons a difficulty has developed with the capital funding of aged care establishment. But to develop a system which acts to the detriment of those who are elderly and financially disadvantaged I do not believe is a solution to the problem. Certainly the proposition or the compromise which has been agreed with the Democrats of increasing the subsidy from $5 to $7, and $12 in some circumstances, will not resolve the problem. We will end up in a situation where those who can afford it will have a higher level of care in, essentially, hotel accommodation with those who cannot afford it either being left in substandard nursing homes or being unable to access nursing home care at all.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Aged Care Bill and associated legislation. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, said on achieving office last year that he wanted to provide Australians with a comfortable and relaxed society, and this has already been addressed by Senator Forshaw in his contribution. Mr Howard promised that the most vulnerable in the community would not be hurt. He said, `We will protect the vulnerable and the needy.' It seems obvious that he was not including our aged population in that warm and fuzzy promise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill and its companion bills are an attack on the rights of elderly Australians to comprehensive, affordable health and community care. This discriminatory and ill-prepared bill will punish Australia's most vulnerable, older people, and will consign them to a two&hyphen;tiered system of health care that will condemn them without money or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5049"> assets to a second rate level of care in older and increasingly run&hyphen;down accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In government, Labor's aged care reform strategy had major social justice objectives&mdash;access, equity and participation. Compare that strategy with those of the Howard administration which has as its driving tenet the user pays. That means you get into quality nursing home care if you have the money, and the money will determine the type of nursing home bed you get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is the equity and fairness in this dollar-driven policy? Labor's policies were responsible for developing aged care based on needs rather than economic capacity to pay. Mr Howard and his Minister for Family Services, Mrs Moylan, profess compassion for the elderly community yet would abandon them to commercially driven market forces where proper care comes a distant second to profitability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague in the other place Jenny Macklin rightly asserts that the introduction of daily fees will ultimately lead to the creation of a two&hyphen;tiered system of nursing home care. In many cases, the elderly citizens of this country who are lucky enough to own a house are in the position of it being their only realisable asset. To place this group of our community in the invidious situation of having to oversee the sale of their home when they are too infirm to cope with all the attendant responsibilities this entails is irresponsible in the extreme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard and Mrs Moylan should visit elderly citizens' organisations and they will find out how deeply these people are concerned about what this government has done to them and how it is deserting them. Mr Howard is to be condemned for abandoning his promise to look after these vulnerable and needy people. The minister, Mrs Moylan, deserves the same condemnation for scaring the life out of ordinary decent people, people who have every right by any standard to affordable and equitable aged care facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party supports measures which lead to  upgrading nursing care. It has always supported such measures. Indeed, during our 13 years in government, we instigated contin 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ual positive reforms and upgrade of care for elderly Australians. Let us take a minute or two to look at Labor's record in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to the misrepresentations and half&hyphen;truths we have heard from Mrs Moylan and others on this matter, Labor in government undertook comprehensive reforms to aged care during its term in office. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's welfare 1993: services and assistance</EMPHASIS> is a detailed report about Australia's health and welfare systems undertaken by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, a body that is independent of government and political parties. That report described the major restructuring of aged care services that started in 1985. It makes the point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was not until the mid 1980s that a substantial overhaul of the aged care system&mdash;the Aged Care Reform Strategy&mdash;was implemented. Changes since that time have been considerable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Labor's strategy also introduced standards of monitoring in 1987. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's welfare 1993</EMPHASIS>  comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The results of a 4 year evaluation of the Standards Monitoring Program in nursing homes . . . included international comparisons, and places the Australian program at the forefront of aged care regulatory practices.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The irresponsible and strident rot being peddled by the Minister for Family Services and the Prime Minister needs to be countered. The fact of the matter is that Australia under Labor had an excellent standard of aged care; it was a world leader in the levels of care provided. This view was shared by delegates to the Alzheimers International Conference held in Scotland in 1994, just to give one example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In adopting a more holistic approach to aged care, Labor provided security and piece of mind for older Australians requiring aged care. This government, in 12 short months, has managed to strip older Australians of their right to a dignified and equitable system of care. The passage of this government's bill will see a return to an incremental approach to aged care, with the addition of the user&hyphen;pays principle and a significant cut of $500 million in government support for aged care.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To date throughout the public debate, the government has provided us with insubstantial and elusive responses to our questions relating to the Aged Care Bill. It has also made a mockery of community consultation, which has been redefined by the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) as `I'll talk and you listen'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has been dragging out the Gregory report as justification for a bill that the government knows to be a dangerous and cruel experiment on a section of the population that I was raised to believe you respected and cared for. Professor Gregory completely rejected&mdash;as does the ALP&mdash;the notion of a market model being used in aged care. That is because he understood this is about caring for older Australians, not making up rules based on one's ability to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has continued to claim that this bill will ensure accessible and equitable access to care for older Australians. If this is the case, why are there 23 sets of principles, or disallowable instruments, in the legislation? Also, why do these instruments include statements such as clause 1(b), which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to promote an appropriate quality of care and accommodation for the recipients of aged care services . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">as opposed to `a higher quality of care'? We believe that this principle must demonstrate a commitment to higher quality care that encompasses best practice and accreditation. The ALP believes it is vital that the government include instruments that focus on the backbone of nursing homes&mdash;and that, of course, is their staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government wanted older Australians to feel as relaxed and comfortable as those on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the government benches feel, it would have included in its legislation principles on service users' rights and high quality care. If this government adhered to the rhetoric it has been using about the system that the Labor government created and refined, it would have no problem in setting benchmarks for the care and dignity of Australians in residential care. But the government does not, and this unfortunately says so much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is ill-conceived and aimed at the lowest mark. I have to say that, on examination of the bill, it does not even look as if it will reach that low mark. The system that the Labor Party implemented and refined was one that was aimed at coping with an ageing population. The Australian Labor Party has maintained that nursing homes should be equally available to all Australians as, without such equity, divisions in systems of care will inevitably arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chasm that exists between Labor's commitment to older people in Australia and that of this government is the fact that the Aged Care Bill is designed to respond to market forces. Labor's plan put people first. But what is intended under this bill is that the care and accommodation of the older generation will be determined by principles of economic rationalism instead of principles of basic rights to live with dignity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this bill, to have had the highest standard of accredited care, to have had a Commonwealth body that regulates on your behalf and a system that allows you to concentrate on your own happiness and health and that of family and friends, instead of having to contemplate the relationship between your financial status and the care you will receive, will become prefaced by the adage `in the good old days'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this government had adhered to the Gregory report, they would not have contributed only a mere $10 million for capital needs for special circumstances. The facilities that often require upgrades are Commonwealth assisted, because they tend to cater for a greater proportion of older people who cannot afford to enter into the user&hyphen;pays system. Tragically, they may have no money, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5051"> no home, no family support or no care networks&mdash;and sometimes all of the above. Consequently, these people will now have no choice in their place of care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister would have to have her head in the sand not to see the effects of these circumstances on many residential care facilities. As the Labor Party has continuously stressed, this is an issue of care, not just accommodation. The Howard government's response to people on low incomes has been dangerously naive in this regard. The government have said that they will fund 27 per cent of places around Australia, and that that 27 per cent will be reserved for people who cannot pay the entry fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that the government has agreed, under pressure, that a couple will not have to dispose of their home as a means of paying for entry if only one person is going into a nursing home, combined with the number of pension recipients who cannot afford the fees, I am gravely concerned that the 27 per cent of places will not cover everyone who has a right to a government assisted reserved place in the next 10 to 20 years. With respect to the sale of the home becoming a reality for many requiring a place in a nursing home, the minister knows full well that around 90 per  cent of people who go into nursing homes have been living alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has resorted to a typical response when trying to launch new policy changes by accusing the Labor Party of scaremongering. We have heard it many times in this chamber from the minister. The reality is that many older people cannot enter the user&hyphen;pays system. The fact that the government has set the subsidy for concessional residents at $5 per bed per day is nothing short of outrageous. The minister has been consistently advised by people in the sector who know what the real costs of the system are, and they have said that $12 per day is the minimum amount that is necessary.</PARA>

We would like the government to explain to the many nursing home residents and staff how they can provide quality care when they will be worse off by up to $200,000 per annum, as is claimed by one group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Many nursing home directors, due to their commitment to the disadvantaged, have provided for a higher proportion of subsidised places. For these directors, this bill sounds like their worst nightmare. These people will be forced to turn away those in need to maintain economic viability. I think this is cruel and unfair to those in management, because they are being punished for caring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in my own community have expressed their bitter disappointment that there is no recognition and, indeed, under this bill, no capability for those who are not in it for a profit. For some in this sector, their life in aged care is genuinely driven by altruism 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5052"> rather than directors' fees. The human factor is extinct in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Viable mechanisms for accountability are also missing. There are so many unanswered questions about the prudential arrangements and the details of the residential subsidy classification instruments that nursing homes really are in disbelief about the planned implementation of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to people in the aged care sector and the community service sectors who are responsible for analysing this bill and disseminating information, there has not been enough information and there are very few signs of cooperative dialogue from the government. For those in the sector, attempts to understand all the parts of this very bill we are debating has produced, according to one person, a `deafening silence' from the government. People in my community here in Canberra have said to me that this much touted change of the aged sector has stalled and that it is in serious need of a major rethink.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board, people are asking us to ensure that users of aged care facilities and workers in that industry will not suffer any more under this government. This is why we are seeking to ensure that this bill is amended. People in my community are very angry,  frustrated and disappointed with a government which, for many, has betrayed them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the government sentiment has been summarised by the member for Hindmarsh when she described this legislation as `revolutionary'. To cut almost $&half; billion from the sector that cares for older people is so revolutionary it is in fact barbaric and extreme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like all those who have made attempts to defend this bill to envisage the society they are trying to create. While you are at it, you can think about what your contribution to the international year for older persons will be in 1999. The Howard government should hang its head in shame. In two years we will be celebrating the lives, experiences, contributions and achievements that older people have made to this country and indeed the world. But under this aged care 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bill the celebration will be marred by the disappointment that older Australians will have in this government, and their ongoing frustration in dealing with a system that is inadequate and ineffective in servicing their needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To have squandered the opportunity to continue the reform that the Labor Party started and instead to choose to attack the funding base and dismantle the structure designed to provide equitable support and protection to those in need is a disgrace, as is this bill. It is fairly typical of a number of initiatives of this government that they have targeted aged care. I draw a parallel with the cuts to child care. In mentioning those two sectors together, I note that it was indeed the Treasurer (Mr Costello) who drew the nation's attention to the fact that these were two of the highest growth areas of government expenditure. Isn't it interesting that the government has chosen the two highest growth areas to totally cut down and dismantle instead of applying an effective strategy that acknowledges that growth and the need for growth in both of those sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that they have cut both those sectors, with all the implications, demonstrates that we do not have a government that governs in the interests of people. We have a government that governs in the interest of the budget bottom line, and that will be to the detriment of us all in the short, medium and long term.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment this evening on the fact that while there have been positive inroads into increasing the number of women in parliaments around the world, it is glaringly obvious that the pace of reform in reducing the gender gap in political life needs to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5053"> accelerate. Inter&hyphen;parliamentary Union, or IPU, studies of women in the parliaments of the world in 1991, 1993, 1995 and 1997 plainly demonstrate the under&hyphen;representation of women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its 1991 study the IPU surveyed the lower or single chamber of the national parliament of each country in the study. At 30 June 1991, women made up only 11 per cent of the world's national parliaments. By 30 June 1993 this figure had dropped to 10.1 per cent and rose again in 1997, so that women now represent about 12 per cent of parliamentarians in the lower or single chamber in parliaments around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are concerning figures for a number of reasons. Firstly, they are dangerously low. Whereas women represent close to 51 per cent of the population, they only represent, on average, about one in eight members of lower houses of parliament, according to IPU study figures. Secondly, in a six&hyphen;year period from 1991 to 1997, when numerous elections have taken place globally, there is no definite trend which indicates a marked increase in the percentage of women parliamentarians. In effect, the figures represent a plateau effect as opposed to an increasing exponential line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Numerous commentators have claimed that the `critical mass' percentage required for women to significantly affect policies and procedures is about 33 per cent. The United Nations regards 30 per cent of women in parliament to be the benchmark for meaningful participation in a country's parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, there are important reasons why the disparity in representation should be overcome. Firstly, there are issues of democracy and egalitarianism. Ideally, a group comprising 50 per cent of the population should have a comparative role in the decision making process of government. It is inequitable to exclude half of the population from the decision making process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, a parliament which does not have a healthy representation of women cannot claim to legitimately represent the population. Thirdly, without making sweeping generalisations, it is fair to say that women are able to bring different perspectives to the decision 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> making process, particularly in the development of social policy.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women parliamentarians are also able to ensure that major government decisions are not made without consideration being given to the impact of those policies on women generally. Fourthly, it is both productive and efficient to involve women in the parliamentary process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So how does Australia fare? Given that Australia was one of the earliest countries in which women gained the right to vote and to stand for federal parliament, progress has been relatively slow. Only 23 out of 148 members of the House of Representatives are women, which is a mere 15.54 per cent. Fortunately, the Senate, due to the method of voting being proportional representation, has double this ratio, with 32.89 per cent of the chamber being women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995 the United Nations ranked Australia 26th in the world in terms of women's representation in the nations' parliaments, based on 1994 data from 114 countries. Australia ranks sixth in the world amongst 130 countries based on 1992 data in a measure which the United Nations calls the gender&hyphen; related development index. This is an average measure of the extent to which a country has been able to provide equally for both its male and female populations in terms of access to the basic human capabilities of a long and healthy life, education, knowledge and a good standard of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is among the top few countries in terms of international comparisons in closing the gender gap. But the relevant issue here is: how can progress towards reducing the gender gap in society generally be translated and duplicated in the political arena? At the moment, there is a total of 21.4 per cent of women in the Australian federal parliament, which falls short of international targets of between 30 and 33 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian experience suggests, however, that the quota system is not the path to follow in terms of improving representation. Quotas are means to engineer outcomes without overt regard to merit or talent. Neither the experience of the British Labour Party nor the Australian Labor Party has been 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5054"> particularly successful with employing quotas to achieve structural transformation to enable greater female participation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Affirmative action policies within the British Labour Party, however, have been gradually adopted and have proved successful. The British Labour Party introduced a quota system in 1994 whereby 50 per cent of targeted seats would have all women candidate short lists. This policy, however, was disallowed in 1995 as a result of a challenge under the United Kingdom Sex Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Irrespective of the end to the quota system which was initiated in 1994, gains were made by British women following the recent general elections. Six hundred and fifty&hyphen;nine seats were contested at the recent British election&mdash;158 by women. In 1992, 138 candidates were women&mdash;representing a rise of only three percentage points since 1992. However, the percentage of women who stood and won has increased by a substantial 37 points. In 1992, most of the women candidates were selected for unwinnable seats, in direct contrast to the 1997 election. Following the 1997 election, 18 per cent of the British parliament, 120 members, is comprised of female parliamentarians, which compares to only 9.2 per cent or 60 members in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These gains reflect the result of political parties&mdash;the British Labour Party in particu lar&mdash;making conscious and concerted decisions to increase the proportion of female representation. Similarly, the Australian Labor Party adopted a quota for preselections whereby women would constitute 35 per cent of the party by 2002. Implementation of this decision has apparently met with resistance from the Queensland and New South Wales branches. The quota system did not ensure that women were more likely to be preselected for safe seats. In her article published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Papers</EMPHASIS>, Eva Cox said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't think the Labor Party's quotas have worked at all. It's fairly sad that the Labor Party, after making a lot of fuss, actually was beaten by the Liberal Party on numbers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The following is a recent measure of the failure of the system: of 15 ALP members, including two women, who retired at or since 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the March 1996 election, in only one case&mdash;Jenny Macklin, the member for Jagajaga&mdash;was a women preselected to replace a retiring member. This represents 6.6 per cent&mdash;well short of the 35 per cent target.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994 the coalition established the National Liberal Women's Forum to attract, train and lobby for women candidates. The women's forum offers guidance, mentor programs, support, training schemes and information kits. The result for the coalition following the 1996 federal election was not an overnight phenomenon but rather something that was part of a longer term plan to improve the status of women within the party and, ultimately, within the Australian political landscape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 28 coalition women in the federal parliament at present out of a total of 48. Forty per cent of all women in the Senate are members of the coalition. The most stark figures are in relation to the House of Representatives. In that other place, 18 out of the 23 women are members of the coalition parties. This represents an overwhelming majority of 78.26 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The challenge, naturally, will be to maintain and increase the proportion of female parliamentarians. The Australian experience and that of many other democracies globally gives credence to the notion that quotas have not delivered the desired outcome and can, in fact, hinder&mdash;not improve&mdash;the status of women in the parliamentary process. It is vital for political parties to establish and implement internal party networks and structures which give women sufficient opportunities to develop the necessary skills and determination to put forward their candidature and succeed in winnable and safe positions.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5054"><TITLE>Unemployment</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to say a few words about the `for all of us' government and to focus on its success in the area of unemployment. I suppose it would like to claim some success in employment, but of course it is really unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5055">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the coalition won government last year, they said that the most fundamental issue they had to address was the budget deficit and that was so critical to achieving better outcomes in terms of investment that would ultimately lead to the creation of jobs. They embarked upon that campaign, which was really a campaign of slash and burn. It did not seem to have too much focus on creating jobs&mdash;in fact, I think it has had exactly the opposite effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government cut almost all of the funding for the labour market programs that we had in place under Working Nation and, in effect, replaced them with nothing, save for one or two ad hoc programs such as the green corps and, more recently, work for the dole. The government did make some of these announcements prior to the election and had a policy about changing industrial relations legislation. That was a fundamentally important thing to do to create jobs, to remove the burden on business in terms of what they saw were very strict industrial relations laws and to free up the labour market. We have not seen too much evidence that that has created too many jobs either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then the focus went on interest rates. It is good that we have seen interest rates come down in this country. But I have to say that, despite the government wanting to claim all of the credit for this, much of it was due to the processes and programs that the former Labor government put in place in addressing  inflation. The very reason we have got low interest rates is that we have low inflation. Yes, I would acknowledge that some credit must go to the government in terms of it addressing the fiscal aspects of government costs, but, in essence, the main reduction in interest rates occurred because of the previous government's management of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though we have got low interest rates and we have heard many claims about how housing affordability has come down&mdash;and it has&mdash;we are not seeing in any way, shape or form people prepared to buy. We have got the lowest interest rates that we have had for many years. The trouble is that people's principal concern&mdash;about their jobs&mdash;is not being addressed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has taken steps to contract out and privatise many government services and many thousands of jobs have been lost. I think I saw the leader of the ACT government saying that, whilst there is a potential for 2,000 jobs to be lost in Newcastle, within the ACT some 4,000 jobs will go in the next two years and the ACT has already lost 4,000 jobs in the previous 12 months. You cannot keep taking out of an economy, no matter where it is, that number of jobs and expect people to maintain confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look around the country at all of the former Public Service jobs that provided services to the community that have been lost, and then take account of all of the cuts that this government has made to various programs in education, health and child care in particular, you will see that people do not have the confidence any more. This government needs to instil some confidence back into the people about security of employment, let alone create employment&mdash;because it is not doing that either. It is not growing the economy. It has no capacity to grow the economy at a rate that will take account of people leaving school looking for jobs, let alone create jobs for those who are currently unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the `for all of us' claim, the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has stated on many occasions that his government would create jobs and would get unemployment down. I think the government had the target of getting unemployment down in their first 12 months to 8.25 per cent. It is well above that and going up. There is no real possibility of it coming down in the very near future&mdash;in fact, a number of people are actually stating that the unemployment rate is likely to go above nine per cent. I believe that will probably be the case if you take account of the things that are happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People do not have the confidence. Whilst there has been an increase in building activity&mdash;and the increase is coming off a very low base&mdash;we will not see the increases that have occurred in the past, simply because, as I said, people do not have the confidence that they will be able to maintain their job. Of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5056"> course, major industries are still downsizing. They are still taking out the slack that they have in many of their industries in terms of employment.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of waiting until those things settle and until the government is able to provide some initiative and some drive in terms of industry development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must deal with the bounty issue. In my state, the very important shipbuilding industry was under threat&mdash;and is still under threat, I might say&mdash;because this government did not have the foresight and the decency to actually acknowledge that we do need to provide some assistance to our industries, particularly when they are competing in the export market against countries that have got major subsidy programs in place to assist their own industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just not acceptable. If the punters had to judge this government on the measure of its success in employment, it would fail miserably. In fact, many surveys show that people are judging them and that they are saying that the coalition leaders fail miserably on the basis of creating jobs for Australians; that they simply do not have any ideas; that they do not have any initiative; that they do not have any strategy for industry development in this country. I think the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, once put it that the government will be judged on its employment record. If that is the case, those opposite will be judged out of office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, because I know Senator Tierney wants to say something, I will just add that, of course, the government's latest saviour for the creation of jobs is a GST. The government wants to introduce a GST. That is now the latest thing that will create the jobs&mdash;how, I do not know. When we look around the world, we do not see too many jobs being created in the countries that actually have a GST. If the coalition, which claims to be for all of us and to be helping low&hyphen;income earners, gets to introduce a GST, low&hyphen;income earners will be the ones to suffer most and will have less confidence about the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that, when the Prime Minister comes back from his cricketing jaunt, he 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ought to sit down with his Treasurer (Mr Costello) and maybe include the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Reith, and have a little round&hyphen;table discussion and first work out what sort of GST they plan to have, if they are going to have one, and at least try to take account of the battlers of this country that they have so long purported to represent. However, the coalition really do not represent them and, until such time as they can come to grips with that, I am sure that the Australian electorate will judge them very badly.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5056"><TITLE>Women

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the comments of Senator Coonan in the debate earlier this evening regarding women and their representation in parliaments around the world and just put on record how proud I am to belong to a party that has achieved more than 50 per cent representation of women in parliaments, not only in the federal parliament but in our various state parliaments where we are represented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly commend the Liberal women on their work in getting increased representation. However, I am very concerned about the fact that many of those women who won seats in the last federal election are quite marginalised. That is, they are in marginal seats and tend to be lower down on upper house tickets. I only hope that that is a challenge that the Liberal Party will embrace come the next election to ensure that the women that they have assisted in gaining office will maintain their seats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also I am proud to belong to the state that was the first in the entire world to given women not only the right to stand for parliament but also the right to vote, and that was South Australia back in 1894. I just wish that we were meeting our IPU targets a little more quickly. In fact, I wish the IPU targets for women's representation in parliaments were around 50 and 60 per cent and then perhaps that would be a little more democratic.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5057">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">South Australia is the area that I wish to discuss tonight, in particular the youth training scheme that operates in South Australia but is now to be discontinued. It is one of the most successful employment initiatives offered to young people in my state and it has had a proven record of success. In fact, the scheme was a joint arrangement between the South Australian state government and the Commonwealth to give young people real access to jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sad to say that in my state the number of 15&hyphen; to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds looking for full&hyphen;time work is now over 37 per cent&mdash;in fact 37.1 per cent according to the latest statistics. This compares with an unemployment rate of 9.8 per cent for those people aged 20 or more looking for full&hyphen;time work in South Australia. As you will be aware, these figures do not take into account the underemployed and other hidden unemployment figures. These figures mean that 8,400 young people in South Australia are without work but want a full&hyphen;time job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These figures are disastrous and should serve as a neon sign to governments both at state and federal level that something is wrong and that the future for many young Australians is particularly bleak. Of course, it is particularly bleak when we are looking at some of the schemes that have been put forward by governments on a state and federal level in order to solve the problem of underemployment and unemployment. We have the Green Corps, which Senator Murphy mentioned earlier, but that is only 3,500 places over the next three years compared with a  potential 75,000 over three to four years that have been lost through LEAP and REAP programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got increased disincentives, financial and psychological, to participate and enter education at every level. At a primary level and secondary level, we are seeing this shift from public education to private education&mdash;that is, a user&hyphen;pays principle. On a higher education level, we are seeing increased fees and charges up front and full&hyphen;cost fees. We are seeing the abolition of labour market program training places&mdash;around 120,000 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> places will be lost over the next three to four years. Recent changes include the work for the dole scheme, so there is a message to young people that somehow it is their fault that they cannot find work and that perhaps they should try a little harder, but, if they cannot find work, we will compel them to work for their meagre social security benefits, with no guarantee, not even a promise, of a job at the end of that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only this week we have seen proposals regarding a common youth allowance, which suggests that, unless you are sick or you are homeless, if you are 16 or 17 and unemployed you will not get unemployment benefits. So many decisions have been taken by decision makers at a range of levels that make the future somewhat bleak for younger Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the youth training scheme, it featured award wages, accredited training for 12 months and a high percentage of ongoing job placements in both the public and the private sectors. It was an Australian best practice model of real job training and creation. The training aimed to give young people the skills that the private and the public sector say young people need but which, of course, they are not necessarily given in school. These skills include basic job survival training, telephone manners, business protocols, et cetera, and exposure to workplaces as diverse as information  technology offices, laboratories, hospitality, warehousing et cetera. All the trainees are expected to be computer literate. I think that is a necessity in today's age. The emphasis was to make these young people ready to work in either sector but, in particular, ready to work in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since December 1993, the youth training scheme has engaged a total of 3,500 young people as trainees. In the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year, a total of 1,200 young people were placed, and the Commonwealth matched a state government commitment of $10.2 million with a further $13.3 million, including some funds from ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority. The funding was provided as an experiment in getting young 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5058"> people to work&mdash;and it was a highly successful one at that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This program did work. Of the original 2,000 trainees, more than 70 per cent found employment. This mean that the current high youth unemployment rate of 37 per cent would be reduced by about a quarter if the scheme were to continue with those kinds of placement rates. The only question left is: why has the government failed to take up this positive experience and taken advantage of a tried and tested scheme and idea? Surely this is what we must be doing if we are to solve not only the unemployment crisis among young Australians but also the under&hyphen;employment crisis.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5058"><TITLE>Old Parliament House</TITLE>

It is a matter that has been brought to the party's attention by two of the party's notables: former Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the Party, Doug Anthony, and former member for Gippsland, Peter Nixon. I might add that both are respected political operators with a record of long and worthy service to the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter relates to Old Parliament House. The complaint is that, if Old Parliament House has been established as a political museum, then why does the old National Party party room not form part of the history of Old Parliament House? After all, the room stood for 62 years as our home base&mdash;that is, for 62 years of our 76&hyphen;year history. It is worthy of note that ours is the second oldest party in existence. We have served in more governments than any other party, yet we have been cut out of the history of the nation's first Parliament House. Many present day members served in Old Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been delegated by my party to pursue the matter, so I went down to Old Parliament House to see this desecration. I attached myself to a public tour of the house and, when it passed the old National Party&mdash;nee Country Party&mdash;party room, the guide glibly said in passing, `Over there is a gallery of famous people.' The guide kept walking 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and took the tour with him. Our history and our room has been reduced to a gallery `over there'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the old signs that once identified the room are gone. But, worse than this, when I peeled off the tour and entered the so&hyphen;called gallery, though I must say I had been warned what to expect, nevertheless the shock was still great. Hanging up on the walls of the grand old party's inner sanctum was a real rogues gallery: Gough Whitlam, Neville Wran, Bob Hawke, Lionel Murphy, Philip Adams, Don Chipp and Edna Everage! This can be verified by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and others who have since been down to the room to see for themselves that it is not just some vision. The party believes that this gallery of rogues should be removed and the room restored to its original state. It is true some of the original furniture has been transferred to our current party room, but we may be willing to return the furniture to restore the old room's authenticity.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The annual Northern Territory Expo is an outstanding  success story that demonstrates the continuing and growing links with the South-East Asian region that the people and the government of the Northern Territory are rapidly cultivating. The expo is also an important forum and opportunity for the Territory to aggressively market and make itself an essential economic partner to Asia. The key focus is to develop trade, business and investment links between the Northern Territory and South&hyphen;East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From its beginning 22 years ago as a local trade fair, the Northern Territory Expo has expanded to become the largest fair of its kind in Australia. At the 1995 expo there were 170 exhibits and 28,000 visitors. Last year the number of exhibits had almost doubled to 316, with visitor numbers, as I said earlier, up to 32,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This phenomenal growth reflects the importance that the Northern Territory government and business community place on this opportunity to reach new markets and showcase their products and services within both Australia and to their northern neighbours. The 1997 Northern Territory Expo is expected to be the biggest and best ever, with 35,000 visitors anticipated and the number of exhibitors exceeding last year's record number, with that number increasing to 320.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The success of Northern Territory Expo is a tribute to the vision and confidence of the Northern Territory government and the Northern Territory Chamber of Commerce and  Industry. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry took control of the expo in 1990 and formed NT Expo Pty Ltd in 1996, a wholly owned subsidiary of the chamber, to manage and organise the event each year. The event has progressed substantially since the chamber began managing it, and its growth is highlighted by the substantial increase in the number of stallholders and visitors, as described earlier. This also indicates the support 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the business community and the wider Darwin community have given to the event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The expo's manager, Elizabeth Hutchinson, who experienced a baptism of fire when she took over the organisation of the 1996 event a mere 10 weeks before the launch, has stressed the importance of community involvement in the event and the growing sense of pride and ownership felt by the people of Darwin towards the expo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no coincidence that the success of the expo in recent years coincides with the stewardship of the chamber and the significant support they receive from the Northern Territory government, particularly the Hon. Eric Poole, the minister, and his Department of Asian Relations, Trade and Industry. Carole Frost, General Manager of the Northern Territory Chamber of Commerce and Industry, describes the expo as the jewel in the crown of the chamber. And I believe that the chamber's 1,000 members in the Territory would agree<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">wholeheartedly with her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national significance placed on the Northern Territory Expo is best illustrated by the fact that this year's event will be the venue for a meeting of the state and territory trade ministers and that it will also receive a number of political and trade dignitaries from Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Federal Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, will again attend the expo, his second since opening the 1996 expo. This year the minister will be presenting the award for the best international exhibit. Mr Fischer's presence at the expo indicates the importance the federal government attaches to the event and the opportunities it offers for expanding trade and markets to the Asian region. Mr Fischer has previously commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The strong support that Expo continues to attract is another demonstration of the Northern Territory's `can do' approach to business and trade.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He believes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Territory's go ahead attitude which has underpinned its strong economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a ringing endorsement of the actions and policies of the Northern Territory Country Liberal Party government with regard to trade 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5060"> and the efforts made to facilitate increased access to Asian markets by Territory business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory government has worked extremely hard to develop and foster trade and business links with its Northern neighbours. The Northern Territory government's Department of Asian Relations, Trade and Industry provides support to business and industry in the Territory to encourage development. The department works with business, industry and government to achieve many objectives, including: the development of business and international trade; the provision of a network of relationships for clients; the identification of trends and emerging technologies; and the transfer of skills and technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rapid growth in trade between the Northern Territory and particularly the members of the Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines group&mdash;or what is called generally the East ASEAN Growth Area&mdash;can in large part be attributed to the Department of Asian Relations, Trade and Industry in the Territory and the successful strategies they have implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The latest annual growth figures for trade between the Northern Territory and the East ASEAN Growth Area, as published in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Territory Business</EMPHASIS>, demonstrate the extent of growth in trade and the effectiveness of strategies being pursued by the department. Trade with the Philippines has increased by 15 per cent, with Brunei by 40 per cent, with Indonesia by 58 per cent, and trade with Malaysia is up by an incredible 90 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the activities of the Northern Territory department and the success of the Northern Territory Expo in increasing trade with countries in the Asian region, another organisation having a significant effect on trade is the International Business Council.  The International Business Council has organised a conference which is one of the four major business and industry conferences and seminars held in the week leading up to the expo that more than l,000 interstate and international delegates attending expo will participate in.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An interesting facet of the International Business Conference is that participants will be matched on a region by region basis. Each participating state, region or province will host their own seminar and participants will be matched at these seminars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other conferences and seminars being held include the Australian Dairy Corporation's, the annual Dairy Classics Night, the Offshore Supply and Service Seminar and the European Commission's `Australia-Europe-Asia: a guide to business opportunities.' The European Union is also featured in the International Pavilion, and they obviously see the NT Expo as an ideal opportunity to enhance their trade with Asia through Australia. This is something of a coup for the expo, as the European Union has a consumer base of 370 million and is now the world's largest trading block.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recognition of the growing importance of Australia and the Northern Territory in this trade to the region has come about through the implementation of long&hyphen;term planning and strategies of the Northern Territory and the issues they have undertaken to stimulate trade, investment and other business. They have participated in memorandums of understanding with various countries and provinces in the region. We are well aware that these include: Indonesia in 1992, China in 1993, the Philippines and Brunei Darussalam in 1995, and Bali and Labuan in 1996. These memorandums of understanding are yet another example of the Territory's desire to pursue stronger and more beneficial relationships with our closest neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only expo and the Northern Territory government wishing to achieve these changes. The Northern Territory University is making a strong push into Asia. A number of courses have focused on South-East Asian trade, culture and language, and the university is also actively recruiting students from Asia. There are also a number of reciprocal academic and research projects in Indonesia and other countries of our near neighbours. These portents of what expo is all about and long&hyphen;term planning underpin and guarantee the special link between the Northern Territory and Asia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5061">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Expo is an initiative of the Northern Territory government, and its Chief Minister, the Hon. Shayne Stone, opened the expo earlier today. The expo will no doubt be an outstanding success, with many businesses and trade deals resulting. The expo, though, is not all business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An added incentive to attend Northern Territory Expo is that there is the opportunity to make extensive and useful business contacts from both overseas and interstate. Participants can also enjoy an active round of social engagements and sporting activities in the absolutely perfect weather of Darwin's dry season.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an 18&hyphen;hole single stableford golf tournament which is to be held at the Darwin Golf Club's international championship course. That is an extremely popular event with visiting Asian business people. There is the gala event, the Northern Territory Expo dinner. This event gives the chance to continue networking on a more informal manner; it is to be held at the MGM Grand Casino. For those who are more musically inclined, there will be two concerts held during the week, a special preview of the International Guitar Festival and the Northern Territory Expo concert featuring several of Australia's finest entertainers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When culture and trade combine, an important synergy develops, and the citizens of the Northern Territory are clearly confident leaders of Australia's important thrust and links with Asia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="11.08 p.m." PAGE="5061"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 11.08 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>
