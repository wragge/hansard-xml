<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been discussions between a number of officers in relation to one matter which I think you raised in relation to shares and ETPs. Those discussions I think were fairly intense on the last working day. When in fact those matters have been resolved, my understanding is that you will move that amendment and that then will be a matter for debate. I think that is the amendment that you are talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My understanding is, apart from a number of amendments which you now have on the table and apart from the amendment that Senator Allison has on the table, that Senator Harradine has an amendment, and then there is that possibility which I suggest we should deal with at the last stage of this debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the amendments before us, we have made a contribution on whether the surcharge is a tax. The issue has been extensively canvassed over the last seven months, as I am sure at least Senator Kemp will agree. We do not have any further contribution to make; we concluded our remarks on Wednesday evening.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will be opposing these amendments. We simply do not accept the proposition that has been put that the superannuation surcharge on high income earners is better described as a tax. That is the contention of the non&hyphen;government parties; it is not the view of the government. The surcharge is defined as an additional charge, and that is the nature of the superannuation surcharge. On the other hand, a tax can be defined as a compulsory unrequited payment demanded by government for its support. There is a distinction between the two, and Senator Sherry's amendment seeks to obfuscate that distinction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of different measures imposed by all governments for the collection of revenue, and some come within the definition of a tax. They are taxes, and they are called taxes. But the superannuation surcharge is clearly not of this nature. It is properly described as a surcharge, and no amount of rhetorical posturings in our view will change that fact.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">In moving these amendments, the Democrats want to again say that this is about ensuring that low income earners do not end up paying the surcharge. In so doing, we also want to make sure that high income earners do not avoid the tax. This amendment seeks to provide a fair balance between these two objectives. It provides the $2,000 contributions exemption for all superannuation accounts out there as at 7 May 1997, but it then rules a line and says that from now on if employees fail to provide tax file numbers to their funds they could be liable for the surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats acutely understand the problems of the funds in relying on members to voluntarily provide their tax file numbers. In evidence to the superannuation committee, the funds advised that response rates from workers to their funds' requests for information very rarely exceed 30 to 40 per cent. Applying this response rate to the super surcharge, 60 to 70 per cent of workers could or would end up paying the super surcharge simply because&mdash;I should say tax at this stage, I suppose&mdash;they fail to return a form. This would create a massive tax windfall for the government running into billions of dollars. Billions of dollars would be taken out of the retirement savings of low income workers, Mr Howard's battlers, under the compulsion of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 7 May cut&hyphen;off is, we think, very important. Superannuation funds only received the statutory authority to ask for tax file numbers in February this year and they are now obliged to ask members for them. Up until now, members have not systematically been asked to provide their tax file numbers. We do not believe that the four million workers on below average earners who having set up a superannuation fund without being asked to provide a tax file number should, at this late stage, have the rules changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the ALP amendment that has been withdrawn, our amendment setting a threshold
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3014"> at average weekly earnings of $33,000 per on annum does leave the possibility that many workers who have not provided their tax file number could end up paying the surcharge. That is why, unlike the ALP's amendments, we have asked for several requirements of the tax office. The tax office will be required to take all reasonable steps to try to find the member's tax file number. Senator Kemp has already outlined the data matching capability of the tax office and the advertising campaigns planned by that office. We think that this and more will be required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax office will be required to write to the member formally warning them and then and only then, having been warned in writing by their super funds on their tax assessment and directly by the tax commissioner, will the surcharge apply. For those people who open a super account after 7 May, the $2,000 threshold does not apply. There will be no advantage to high income earners splitting their super accounts but, before the commissioner can apply the surcharge to a person with low superannuation amounts, the tax office will have to write to them a second time&mdash;this time at both their residential and business address&mdash;to warn them. That will be five warnings altogether and we think that that is fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment is not perfect and I wish to reiterate that all of these problems could have been avoided if the government had agreed to the majority recommendation of the Senate superannuation committee and implemented the tax through the PAYE tax system. They failed to do so and we are, in effect, reduced to bandaiding the very worst aspects of the cumbersome collection mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate that, with this amendment, we protect the workers already in the super system, we provide a range of extra protection in the form of additional warnings and we oblige the tax office in respect of workers yet to come into the system. We also ensure that tax planners miss out on the opportunity to avoid the surcharge for high income earners by rearranging their affairs to fit into an exemption intended for low income earners. I think this is a fair amendment and I commend it to the committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, Senator Allison referred in her comments to the fact that we had withdrawn our amendments in respect of low and middle income earners. We have not.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next point I wish to make is relatively minor, but I think it is important in the context of this debate. I understand that the amendment of the Democrats has the support of the government and in fact has been drafted largely with the assistance of the government's advisers. The date of 7 May is important because, as I understand it, the date on which funds can start asking for tax file numbers for the purpose of this legislation is the date on which the legislation becomes law, whenever that will be&mdash;a week or two; I do not know. So we would have thought
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3015"> that if you were going to adopt this approach&mdash;I do not agree with this approach, and I will come to that shortly&mdash;logically you would choose a date at some time in the future, in the next two weeks. I am sure that Senator Kemp would have had some idea on what date this would have been presented to the Governor for signing. I think it has to be formally gazetted&mdash;whatever that date may be. It is a minor point, but I think it is important in the way in which this date of 7 May was designated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed solution of the Democrats is not satisfactory to the Australian Labor Party. I would like to remind Senator Allison that last week she indicated publicly that the Australian Democrats would be supporting our proposed amendments. I have a copy of the press release from Senator Allison dated 6 May which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats will support the two sets of amendments announced by the ALP today and call on the government to accept these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The new Democrat position is a substantial retreat from that position that was enunciated by Labor and the Greens and clearly by Senator Harradine on this particular legislation. We find that very disappointing. We find the proposed `compromise' of the Democrats very messy. It has a significant number of flaws in itself, putting aside the problem that is going to be confronted by people earning between $35,000 and $70,000 a year, and I will get to that shortly as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I would like to make about the latest Democrat position is that I do take exception to one particular clause in Senator Allison's media release of 8 May in which she says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senate debate on surcharge legislation will continue on Monday with Senator Allison expressing disappointment that the bill had not been dealt with by now, blaming the ALP of filibustering and time wasting for the delay.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I recall it, we received a final copy of the amendment we are currently considering&mdash;which is a very important  amendment&mdash;about an hour before we were to adjourn on Wednesday. It simply was not possible to complete this legislation on Wednesday night. If we had not co-operated and gone on to other
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provisions in the bill, we would not have been able to deal with the amendment that the Democrats and Mr Costello's office were attempting to cobble together. I make that point. I think your accusation about alleged time wasting on our behalf is incorrect. It simply would have been impossible to have concluded the debate on this package of legislation given that we had only one hour to go on your amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your amendment did require careful examination. Frankly, when we are dealing with the taxation of potentially millions of people who should not be caught in the tax net, I do think we need a little more than one hour in order to study the detail of your proposed deal with the government, particularly when my advisers and I and everyone involved in consideration of legislation is in the chamber, including the Democrats and Senator Harradine and Green senators. I think it was extremely unreasonable to have expected us to have that amendment&mdash;going to a very important area&mdash;plonked in front of us an hour before the conclusion of debate on a Wednesday and to have concluded debate on it and everything else in that remaining hour. I think it was very unreasonable, Senator Allison, and I reject your assertion of a filibuster. We do not want to delay the time of the chamber any more than necessary, and that will be further evidenced in the approach we take to the RSA package of legislation later where we will be, by our actions, saving a considerable amount of the chamber's time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the substance of the deal between the Democrats and Mr Costello. Let me deal with the issue of the warnings from the tax office. If you are going to give these warnings to what are defined as lower and middle income earners, why does the Democrat&hyphen;government amendment not provide the same level of warning to people earning between $35,000 and $70,000 a year? Even if we are not attempting to exclude&mdash;and we are not&mdash;people earning less than AWEs from the collection of the superannuation tax, why should we not give the same level of warning&mdash;that is, four letters from the tax office&mdash;to those people earning between $35,000 and $70,000 a year?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3016">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would seem to me that that is a critical flaw in your approach. If we are not going to exempt them from the collection of the tax, we can at least provide the same level of warning vis-a-vis the tax office to that group of people as we are giving to that group of people earning less than $35,000 a year. I see that as a critical defect in the logic of your approach on the warnings from the tax office itself. There are two million taxpayers earning between $35,000 and $70,000 a year. Why should they not be given the same level of warning from the tax office as people earning less than $35,000 whom we are trying to exempt from the collection of this tax? I make that point first of all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the problem with the Democrat&hyphen;government approach is that it will still bring some people who earn less than $35,000 a year into the surcharge tax net. You have a cut-off date of 7 May. What you are effectively saying is that superannuation accounts prior to 7 May can be excluded and that low and middle income earners with no tax file numbers can be excluded and can go through the warning process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there will be a significant number of lower and middle income earners who will have new superannuation accounts from 7 May, which is your cut-off date. We do not know what the total number will be, but I point out to the chamber that in 1995-96, the last year for which we could obtain figures, there were one million new superannuation accounts in this country. If you think about that issue and the fact that we are going on to RSAs&mdash;which the government wants to encourage&mdash;we are going to have a considerable number of new superannuation accounts opened up after 7 May. I do not necessarily think that is a good thing, but that is the reality we face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will certainly be a significant proportion of people who earn less than $35,000 on the basis of encouragement from the government in respect to the retirement savings accounts vehicles, which we will consider next. There  will be a considerable number of people who will earn less than $35,000, even with the warnings from the tax office and the warning from their own funds, who will be
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> caught. We do not know what the total number will be. But, given that there have been one million new superannuation accounts in the last year for which we can obtain accurate figures and given that we will have RSAs because of a further deal between the Democrats and the government, there will have to be some people caught who earn less than $35,000. This does not deal with the issue of people who earn between $35,000 and $70,000&mdash;some two million of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This package that has been cobbled together by the Treasurer, the government and the Democrats really highlights the general chaos that is going to ensue as a result of the passing of this package of legislation. It appears certain that it is going to be passed. It highlights the problem of a collection mechanism and the indirect collection of this tax using tax file numbers that superannuation funds do not have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have dealt with this earlier in the debate. On top of the letters that the funds will have to send out&mdash;most funds which I have consulted with and have listened to say that they will have to send out two or three letters&mdash;there will also be up to four letters from the tax office. The approximately eight million taxpayers in this country and the 16 million superannuation account holders are going to be bombarded with material over the next year&mdash;absolutely bombarded. They are going to get at least four to seven or eight letters. If nothing is going to highlight the shambles of this legislation, that issue certainly is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe this is grossly inefficient. Consider the costs involved in the sheer volume of correspondence that will have to be sent out by both the tax office and superannuation funds. We are given figures of between $20 and $100 million by the funds. There will be extra costs involved by the tax office. I certainly hope that it will not be taken off some other area of the tax office's budgetary allocation. That is a question we would like Senator Kemp to inform us on. What are the extra costs involved for the tax office?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This serves to highlight the gross inefficiency of collecting a tax in this way and why our
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3017"> threshold amendment on the second reading debate to refer this legislation back to the government for a rewrite should have been passed. We are dealing in a piecemeal fashion, bit by bit, with some success from the Labor point of view and the other senators in the chamber who have supported our particular amendments at times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is still a shambles. The Democrat-government deal on this particular provision highlights the shambles that is going to occur once this legislation is put into law. Labor will not support the Democrat-government compromise for the reasons I have outlined. Firstly, it is evidence of the further shambles. Secondly, there will be extraordinary extra costs involved. Fund members in this country will be bombarded with letters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other undesirable side effect of all this is the enormous uncertainty that has been created out in the broader community about superannuation, but not amongst higher income earners, although there certainly is significant uncertainty amongst them. Because of the collection mechanism and the volume of correspondence, everyone in this country is wondering, `What on earth is going on with my superannuation as a consequence of this legislation? Why am I getting letters from the tax office saying, "Provide the tax file number voluntarily" or I'll get hit with a new tax? I'm not supposed to pay this tax because I earn less than $70,000.' There is uncertainty about people's superannuation. I saw a survey last week. Uncertainty levels are increasing rapidly&mdash;in significant part because of this debate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry is also worried about people's confidence in superannuation being undermined. Physician heal thyself. I do not think confidence is being undermined in superannuation. But, to the extent it is, Senator Sherry, I think that you would be the key suspect because of the way you have behaved in trying to sow enormous seeds of uncertainty over this particular issue. I do not believe that it is the case but, if it were the case, on those grounds you would be the first person charged, I would think, with attempting to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next point I would make is on the old furphy which is rolled out relentlessly: that there is a better way to do it. We looked at the other options, including those which Senator Sherry `seemed' to be supporting, but would never quite put his moniker to, it has to be said. Senator Sherry's options would have involved very substantial costs on one million employers, additional work for 10 million or so taxpayers, and the superannuation funds would still be involved in a very similar way. Whatever glib arguments you trot forward, Senator Sherry, neither you nor the Labor Party were ever able to come up with any feasible alternative; not surprisingly, because all options were carefully considered
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3018"> by us. This is the option which we feel meets the appropriate criteria. It is certainly vastly more efficient than the mechanism which you put forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, I do not know how we can ever answer you. Last week you felt there were too few warnings; this week you feel that there are too many. I do not know what the balance is. When you really do not know what you believe in it is very hard to fix a position. I am not one noted in this parliament for being constantly on his feet praising the Democrats, but I will say this for the Democrats: they believe that the 15 per cent surcharge is a principle worth supporting. They believe that we need to address the issues of equity in superannuation. The Democrats at least came to this debate uncluttered. You, on the other hand, Senator Sherry, never believed in the 15 per cent surcharge. You ducked and weaved and made every attempt you could to undermine this particular measure. It is the dilemma of the modern Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, we will be supporting this amendment, although it was not one which we felt was necessary. We felt we had taken all reasonable steps to cover the particular concerns which had been raised. Nonetheless, we recognise the numbers in this chamber. We worked with the Democrats to see whether we could work out an amendment which addressed the central issue and at the same time did not open up a major area of tax avoidance. We believe this has been done. The date of 7 May was chosen because that is the date on which this material became public. We certainly did not want to leave a gap where some high income earners could, if they wished, split their contributions into new accounts so that each new account had contributions of less than $2,000. In other words, I think it was a reasonable measure in order to stop the splitting of contributions into accounts so the surcharge would not be imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had press releases from Senator Sherry over this and we have had Senator Sherry on the radio over this. Senator Sherry has been here, there and everywhere talking about the low and middle income earners. Despite all your rhetoric, Senator Sherry,

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not be supporting the Democrat amendment, because we do not believe it is comprehensive enough. We believe it has a number of flaws. I will raise an issue. Senator Kemp, I was not complaining about the new tax office provision; I was highlighting the cost of it and the limitations and the flaws in that approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us assume that the tax office has to send out two letters to everyone. That will mean a minimum of 20 million items of correspondence&mdash;I think that is a good average&mdash;going out from the tax office alone at a cost of 45c each. There will be more correspondence because there are many more superannuation accounts. That will cost $10 million, not counting all the extra administrative costs incurred by the tax office in sending all this correspondence out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like Senator Kemp to give us some ballpark figure of the extra costs involved in this level of correspondence. You must have worked out some sort of costing of this amendment. We do not have a problem with greater correspondence with members; in fact we think it is going to be very useful because it highlights the incompetence of the government on this package of legislation. We would like to know your preliminary costing for this extra mail&hyphen;out from the tax office and where the money is going to come from. This does highlight the extra costs that funds will
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have to incur, because funds are going to have to follow a similar process as well. So you have not answered that question Senator Kemp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like Senator Allison or Senator Kemp to tell us how the tax will affect people who open a new account after 7 May and who have accounts already opened prior to 7 May&mdash;many people will have accounts prior to 7 May. How will the tax treat the pre-7 May accounts if they have not provided their tax file number on their post-7 May account? I think there are going to be some significant complexities arising from the cut-off date. I would appreciate some advice on that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude my comments because we do not want to prolong this debate unnecessarily; it has had a considerable airing. I want to touch on the final issue of tax evasion that Senator Kemp has mentioned and the reason why the cut-off date of 7 May is in this amendment. We are looking at relatively small amounts in tax that will be collected from low and middle income earners, depending on their superannuation contributions.</PARA>

So, in order to prevent what the government thinks may be another push for tax avoidance in relation to higher income people, who could split their superannuation contributions into several different sorts, perhaps all they needed to put was the word `total', for heaven's sake! Instead of this, we are deliberately saying to at least one major and growing group in our society, `Once again you are going to get it in the neck because of the economic situation over which you have no control.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some concluding remarks. I need to indicate, firstly, that I spoke to our package of amendments earlier rather than to the three amendments which are on sheet 515. These amendments, of course, are consequential to the amendments which I foreshadowed to the imposition bill; I hope I have corrected that. Of course, these amendments allow the commissioner to amend an assessment and to impose the surcharge on a high income earner if it later emerges that they had not paid the surcharge because they fell within the $2,000 exemption. It makes it clear that high income earners cannot avoid the surcharge. It ensures that the $2,000 threshold does not bring with it a revenue cost in the collection of the surcharge on high income earners. For that reason, we have put this forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I need to make a response to Senator Sherry's remarks a little earlier about the fact that this does not catch, if you like, or address the question of those with incomes higher than $33,000 but lower than the level at which the tax applies. I remind him that his own amendments also chose this threshold of $2,000. We thought that was reasonable and that is the reason that we put this into our
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3022"> amendment. So I think Senator Sherry is being rather mischievous in suggesting that this is something that he would not have supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, I also need to say that I would agree with Senator Sherry's remarks about lower and middle income earners not being tax dodgers. But I remind him that all those income earners need to do&mdash;and we think we have put in adequate provisions to see that they are informed about this&mdash;to avoid paying this tax is to send their tax file number to their superannuation fund. So it is a simple means by which they can avoid this surcharge and our amendments seek to put those protection measures in place. I am disappointed that the opposition is not going to vote for our amendments because we think that they are fair and they are workable. I have to say that it has transpired that the opposition's amendments are not.</PARA></SPEECH>

I read through the six to 10 steps that the tax office was taking, and there was a lot of debate whether that was sufficient and whether more needed to be done.

But certainly is it $10 million, $20 million or $30 million? Some ballpark estimate would be useful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I have raised, Senator Allison and Senator Kemp, is what happens to people who have superannuation accounts open prior to 7 May who do not provide a tax file number with an account that is opened after 7 May?

Let me take you through it again. Superannuation funds have to supply the contributor's name, they have to supply the contributions and the tax file number as amended as a result of this. They send that to the tax office. What is so dramatically complex about that? Then the tax office matches the income and the contributions. Where a debit has to be raised, that is then sent back.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Okay, so it is on top of that figure plus the extra cost to the superannuation funds which they tell us is between $20 million and $100 million. What is that all up? Let us assume a $100 million round figure approximately&mdash;to collect half a billion dollars in revenue from supposedly high income earners only. In the meantime, what are all these high income earners doing? You pick up the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>  and tax advice newsletters and you will see they are all looking at repackaging and getting out of superannuation. So we have what might be $50 million&mdash;I think that is on the low side, as the all&hyphen;up cost of collecting this tax; it might be $100 million&mdash;to collect half a billion dollars in revenue from supposedly just the high income earners earning more than $70,000. And those high income earners are out there repackaging as quickly as they can and pulling out of super.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treasury is saying that there will not be one dollar lost from high income earners repackaging&mdash;they have told us that. No wonder they do not want to give us advice on what this is going to cost to collect. They told us that there would not be one dollar of revenue lost from high income earners&mdash;they told us that either in the select committee hearings or the estimates hearings. I predict there will be a significant loss of revenue in the second and third year from high income earners repackaging. We know they are doing it at the moment. All the anecdotal evidence supports that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3026"> and, again, if you would listen to industry, you would know that, Senator Kemp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have $50 million to $100 million in extra administrative costs to collect what might turn out to be $300 million from high income earners&mdash;maybe $300 million or $400 million. We do not think that the government will get the half a billion dollars in the second and third years from higher income earners. It might get it from people earning less than $70,000 a year. That makes it an extraordinarily expensive and inefficient tax to collect, extraordinarily so by any measure. One of the fundamental approaches to tax is to at least have an efficient collection mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kemp is not going to provide us with the figures. That is regrettable. History will tell us in a few years whether or not this is an efficient tax, as well as disclosing all the other problems that we foresee arising with it. History will tell us that, and we will look back in a few years, after this has all been implemented, at the total true cost and the total true revenue from high income earners and at the total revenue collected from people earning less than $70,000. We will also be able to measure the effect on confidence in the superannuation industry. By then we might have one state that is willing to say that it is going to pass state laws to collect this new tax. We do not have any yet. By then of course it might have been challenged in the courts. It might all disappear into history in the Federal Court and possibly the High Court. All these are unresolved issues.</PARA>

I honestly wish people would listen to what Senator Allison is saying. Protection is provided. It is no good you getting up and asserting that this is not the case. If there was a new account after 7 May and no TFN, after taking all the required steps, including writing to the member twice and so forth, the fund would tell the person, `If you open up an account after 7 May a tax file number may prevent you paying the surcharge'.

The effect of my proposal is to try to ensure that income is taxed once and once only when it is received into the hands of the recipient and not before. It is a fair taxation principle that income should only be taxed once and once only when it is received into the hands of the recipient. That, I believe, is fair, equitable, reasonable and just. This is what my amendment seeks to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The superannuation surcharge represents further taxation. It is in effect double taxation. When it comes to Commonwealth public servants and state public servants the surcharge also applies to people&mdash;we will deal with them later&mdash;who are part way through their careers and as such it will be a retrospective charge because it will result in the reduction in a promised employer contribution. Those who entered into the schemes did not do so on the basis that there would be such a surcharge as proposed in this legislation. They entered into an agreement with their employer to enter a superannuation scheme which would recognise the contribution that they have made to the public. I am talking now of Commonwealth public servants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people have given years of service on lower salaries than they could earn elsewhere.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3029"> There are many of those. They chose to go into the Public Service because it gave them some sort of guarantee. Superannuation was a very big factor in the minds of many public servants when they chose to go into the Public Service. They could have received higher salary packages outside.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will be aware, Madam Temporary Chairman, and other senators will be aware, especially those in the government, that I have not always considered that the Public Service provided the best advice to various governments. I have questioned them constantly in estimates committees and elsewhere. Surely the government's senior advisers do not deserve retrospective double taxation of their pensions and that is precisely what this measure does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a technical level, the surcharge can only operate for unfunded pension schemes&mdash;for example, for public servants, government schemes and the armed forces&mdash;by creating a notional or hypothetical surchargeable employer contribution. And If we debate the third reading of the bill or if we come to a situation where we have to declare a vote for or against this legislation I will come to the problem of the constitution with respect to that matter. I just wanted to refer to the fact that there are quite serious constitutional problems in imposing a tax on a notional amount. For example, I raise the question: what is the `subject of taxation' as required by the constitution?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely sensible government policy would encourage superannuation to be paid as a pension or annuity instead of by way of lump sum. But what the government is doing here with this measure is discriminating against those who take their amounts as pensions or as annuities. That policy of the government surely will force people to prefer lump sums to pensions. According to the government, in the long run only private pensions can do the job of replacing public pensions, and that is what this is all about. But in this legislation the government is discriminating against those who take the payments as annuities or pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that time is on the wing, but I would like to ask a number of questions of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the minister. In the case of pensions or annuities not paid out of a fund, the surcharge can only operate by forcing a reduction in pensions promised by the employer. I would ask the minister: is that just; is that proper? For example, take a Commonwealth public servant. Why is it equitable to impose a second tax on a pension which is already fully taxable? Is it not retrospective for an employer such as the Commonwealth to cut the pension promised to a public servant halfway through the term of his or her service? What is so wrong with attempting to provide for one's own retirement that one should be punished with retrospective double taxation for doing so?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will leave it at that. I do feel that it is very important not to discriminate, even if this is a discriminatory bill as a whole. I feel that the minister should respond to the questions that I have asked him&mdash;particularly as he is representing the employer of Commonwealth public servants&mdash;as to whether it is just to do what he is proposing to do and as to whether what I am proposing by this amendment will at least ameliorate that situation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will not be supporting the amendment. The amendment proposes to exclude non&hyphen;commutable pensions or annuities from the application of the surcharge. In order to be equitable, the surcharge should not discriminate between various categories. In other words, it should be applied in an equitable fashion amongst the various ranges and types of superannuation schemes which are in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The surcharge does not discriminate between pensions or lump sums. It does not alter the current balance. Pensions are commuted to pay the surcharge, whereas the surcharge is funded from the lump sum. It does not discriminate. Senator Harradine's amendment would discriminate strongly in favour of a particular class of pension schemes. Senator Harradine mentioned the Commonwealth Public Service and the state Public Service, and I endorse the good work which is done in the Public Service. I have great respect for the work which is done in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3030"> the Commonwealth Public Service, with which I have closest association. But this is not about the Public Service. This is about fairness and equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine, I know this is not your intention, but if your amendment were accepted, let me tell you what the headline on the front page of all major newspapers would be tomorrow: `Senators vote to exclude themselves from the application of the surcharge'. That would be the headline, because the effect of your amendment is to exclude Commonwealth schemes, which includes the schemes paid to senators and members of parliament. It would be contrary to what the Treasurer announced in his budget speech last year. We do not think that is fair, and we will not be supporting your amendment. This is not a retrospective amendment; it applies from 20 August last year when it was announced. It affects the contributions of high income earners from that date, but it is not retrospective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, we believe that, on the contrary, this is a principled bill; it is not an unprincipled bill. It is a principled bill because it attempts to address the fact that most of the concessions available to superannuation flow to upper income people. It attempts to address what is an inequity, so it is not an unprincipled bill. It is quite the reverse, in my view. It affects public servants in the higher income group just as it effects all other members of the community in the higher income group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of technical issues involved. For example, I am advised that with your amendment it would not apply where an eligible termination payment is rolled over to purchase a non-commutable pension or annuity, unless the previous surcharge assessments were reopened and amended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, we listened to what you said. We think your amendment would bring in discrimination between various types of funds, which we do not support. We believe that this bill attempts to ensure there is equity between all type of funds. Therefore, we cannot support the proposal that you have put before the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor introduced the superannuation guarantee charge in order that Australians would be self&hyphen;funded or partially self&hyphen;funded during their retirement. Labor believes that our superannuation system&mdash;and it is our superannuation system&mdash;in contrast to the approach of the Liberal government to superannuation, encouraged security and stability for individuals in their retirement. More will be said about this as a consequence of what is obviously Mr Costello's view that the additional three per cent government contribution will not be paid to Australian workers' superannuation. That will be an argument after the budget. We believe that the government's tax will contribute to undermining security and stability in retirement. A range of other issues has contributed to this lack of security and stability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the Liberal government's approach to superannuation seeks also to remove incentives for individuals to take their superannuation as pensions. That is one of the undesirable consequences of the package of legislation we have before us. Why would you take superannuation as a pension when you could take it as a lump sum, therefore minimising your surcharge debt? We believe that will be one of the consequences of the passing of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just an issue for the public sector; it is an issue for the whole community. There are schemes relating to BHP, Coles Myer, CSR, Amcor and Coca&hyphen;Cola. A considerable number of private sector superannuation funds have pension provisions within them. The members may receive pensions; we believe it is a good thing that they receive pensions. The whole of government debt establishes an income scheme that is taxed at whatever the marginal tax rate is later in life. We believe that is a good approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the fundamentals of Senator Harradine's approach on this issue are correct. We do not believe that we as politicians should in any way be seen to be favourably
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3033"> treated by any amendments that we consider before the Senate, and that is why Labor is excluding the parliamentary superannuation fund. We will support Senator Harradine's amendment if our amendment is carried. He may accept it; I am not sure. It is up to the will of the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I finish on the point I raised earlier. This legislation does not cover state politicians or, for that matter, state government employees. Despite your bland assurances that we have been hearing for some six months now, Senator Kemp, we are not confident that, at the end of the day, state government employees will be covered by this package of legislation in whatever form the states choose to implement legislation at the state level. There has been no sign to date that they will move in this area&mdash;in fact, all the signs have been negative, as you have alluded to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will have a grossly unfair situation where employees in the private sector and employees in the Commonwealth public sector, except for current serving judges, will be hit by this new tax. We will have emerge a new tax that will exclude certain classes of employees in this country by virtue of being state government employees. We make that prediction now, Senator Kemp. I hope it does not happen, but we believe it will on all the evidence that we have before us. There is no certainty that the states will act to pass complementary legislation at the state level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, we think the theme and the thrust of Senator Harradine's amendment is correct. We do not believe that parliamentarians should be treated differently and we intend to ensure that they are not. For that reason, I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But you said you were supporting it. Then I pointed out to you that you were about to exclude politicians from the surcharge. That is when I pointed that out to you and then you rapidly had to do a backflip. That is how careless you have been on this whole measure. This shows the lack of thought and application which has gone into this fairness measure that should be applied equitably to high income earners regardless of the schemes they are in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not alter, Senator Harradine, the balance between the funded and unfunded schemes. In fact, the whole point is to ensure that there is equitable treatment right across the system. In my view, Senator Allison was correct to point out that the concessions which are available flow in large part to people on high incomes. That is why this measure is about equity. That is why it is a principled measure, and that is why the government supports it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, most people in the community support the principle of it. It is only the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> modern Labor party which does not believe in equity and which has been all over the place on this issue. Senator, I have noted before how you have flip&hyphen;flopped on this issue because you are from an unprincipled position. The principled position is that we have to address the issue that most concessions in the superannuation area flow to high income earners and therefore it is not unreasonable that the 15 per cent should be applied. I would have thought that any traditional Labor Party, noting that it applied to high income earners, would have found no difficulty in accepting that principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have been all over the place on it. Your leader has said that he accepts the principle, but you have done everything you can in this chamber to undermine and to defeat this bill. You almost made a complete goose of yourself, frankly, by supporting an amendment which would have meant that MPs did not have to pay the surcharge. That is the position that you got yourself and the Labor party into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that was not the intention of Senator Harradine, but with your interest in this matter, Senator Sherry, you should have been quite aware of what you were voting for. As a consequence, you have been forced to move an amendment&mdash;much to your own embarrassment, but noting the howls of rage that would have come from the Australian public when it saw that the Labor Party was attempting to support MPs being excluded from the application of this surcharge. We believe this surcharge should be applied across the board to high income earners, regardless of the particular schemes they are in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, you mentioned the states to me and whether we had received any recent communication from them. I am advised that there has been some correspondence from the states. This forms part of the consultation process and will obviously be progressed when the legislation is passed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contribution just made by the minister must be answered. There is absolutely no principle behind the government's superannuation legislation that is currently before this chamber. Every time that this is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3035"> pointed out, the minister starts diversionary activities; he takes a populist line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> When it is pointed out to him that there is need to protect low income earners from paying this surcharge, what does he do? He cans that on the basis that it might mean that there will be tax avoidance. That term `tax avoidance' is a prejudicial term, and you are using it for prejudicial purposes. Then, when we are attempting to get some equity into this inequitable piece of legislation, you say, `Oh, look at the politicians. This is going to let them go scot&hyphen;free.' That is another prejudicial statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us get down to the principles that should be applied, those principles have been enunciated by philosophers and economists over the years. Let me remind you, Mr Temporary Chairman, and the committee of what I said in the second reading debate. I referred to this question of principle and John Stuart Mill in his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Principles of Political Economy</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I referred also to Professor William Vickrey who is now a Professor Emeritus of Colombia University and former President of the American Economic Association. He examined this question of equity as far back as 1947. The principle of lifetime income averaging did find favour with him and with economists such as J.S Mill. Professor Vickrey makes the point in his treatise, Agenda for Progressive Taxation, at page 166&mdash;and I ask you to deny whether this is a proper principle or not, Minister&mdash;where he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There would still be a very serious doubt of the equity of taxing each year's income as a separate entity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And underlying this whole measure that is what you are doing. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With progressive rates, an individual whose income fluctuates from year to year will, under this method, pay a heavier tax than an individual having the same average income more evenly distributed from year to year.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Vickrey goes on at page 186 to point out that it is logical in fact to average a taxpayer's income over his lifetime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want the government to come back to the question of principle. Senator Sherry&mdash;or it may have been Senator Margetts&mdash;asked the minister whether the government supported
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the taking of the amounts by way of pension or annuity, or whether they are supporting the lump&hyphen;sum approach. If they are wanting to have an equitable arrangement then they have not got it in the legislation because, as you know, there is a maximum amount of tax payable for persons receiving lump sums. That maximum figure, that ceiling, does not apply in respect of pensions and annuities. Those pensions and annuities, in fact, will be taxed at a greater amount than will the lump sums. Is that fair? Is that equitable? I ask the minister to respond to what I have said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is it not retrospective double taxation? A person who has worked half his life with a set idea of what his pension will be will now be taxed at a new rate. Why? You are taxing at an extraordinarily high rate the sacrifice that that person&mdash;he may be a Commonwealth public servant&mdash;has made to the public of Australia. That person, who has struggled on lower rates of pay, now may have a particular rate of pay that appears on the face of it to be substantial. Also, regard has not been given to the number of dependants that a person on that income may have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I refer to what Senator Margetts said. She asked whether the government is really moving towards the ultimate elimination of the age pension. I think she is right.</PARA>

I have the figures: of more than 143,000 employees reaching eligible pension age in 1997, 12 per cent of males and nine per cent of females will die before they are eligible to receive the proposed full cash bonus. Great saving, Minister, great saving! Death is very handy for the budget, is it not? And this at a time, would you believe, when we have high unemployment and when you have heaps of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3036"> people whom I know desire to retire at 60 or 65 but cannot because of economic pressures. What the government ought to be doing is to allow those persons who desire to retire to do so. It ought to give them the incentive to retire so that they can carry out their socially constructive work in voluntary organisations and enjoy their retirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead, this government is using death to bolster its budget. I think that is disgraceful. We will hear more of that, of course. I hope the press have got it wrong&mdash;I really do&mdash;because such a proposal is ludicrous when you have got such a great number of unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The description of unemployment is that you have more people seeking paid work when there are no jobs available and new jobs have been slashed as a result of technological change and a number of other economic reasons. Under those circumstances, surely you would encourage people to leave the way open for others to enter the paid work force and so ensure that those people are able to do what they really want to do. That would be beneficial to voluntary organisations throughout Australia. I know a number of people who would love to retire if they could do so, if that sort of incentive were available the other way around.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that your hysteria and rhetorical flourishes do not cover up the fact that you almost made a total goose of yourself earlier in the afternoon when you were about to support an amendment to exempt politicians from the surcharge. My pointing that out to you, as I said, led to one of the greatest flurries of activity that I have
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3040"> seen on your side of the chamber in the last 13 months. Senator, be in no doubt that your effort to undermine the surcharge is legendary. You have attempted to use every device, including the pretence that low and middle income earners were going to be hit, and your attempt to argue its constitutionality. After anyone gave you half a reason, you were out there trying to undermine the surcharge, Senator, and we know what the very reasons were.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your arguments ring totally hollow. They are utterly hollow. The reality is that this is a fair bill. It is an equitable bill. We are very confident of the constitutionality of the bill and of course it has been drafted to ensure its constitutionality. I can assure you that, as the Treasurer said in his budget night speech and as I say today, there is no question that federal politicians will be liable for the surcharge, and they would not have been if the amendment you are about to support had got through.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kemp, I am pleased on behalf of the numerous organisations and individuals that have made representations to us about the problems involving this new 15 per cent tax. We are pleased to have taken into account the concerns of organisations and individuals like Lambda Consulting; Sedgwick, Noble and Lowndes Ltd; Access Economics; Actuarial Buck Consultants; the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants; KPMG; Macquarie Investment; David Knox, a professor from the University of Melbourne, and your own superannuation adviser for a period of time, Coopers and Lybrand; the AMP Society; ASFA; the Institute of Actuaries; William M. Mercer Pty Ltd; National Mutual; Bankers Trust; the Taxation Institute of Australia and many more. We are pleased to be able to represent them in this chamber to try to minimise the effects of your surcharge, now a tax, particularly when you cannot name one organisation or individual except supposedly the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley. What a great referee that makes for you. You cannot give us the name of any

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a bit rich for the minister to be suggesting that the opposition and presumably others who are opposing this measure are using a contrived argument in this particular sphere. What is the greatest contrived argument that has been floated about this chamber and the House of Representatives during this whole time of consideration of this measure? It is a contrived argument by the government to call this measure a surcharge when in fact it is a tax and has now been recognised by this Senate as a tax. I would have thought that the government should recognise that and now, at this late stage, withdraw this measure. If it wants to achieve the objectives that its policy determines it achieve, make the collection through the taxation system. You will then not endanger lower and middle income earners. You will be striking the targets that you are after, and there would be no administrative problem in that particular way. Now you have got all of these administrative problems as a result of the fact that you have described this measure as a surcharge and not as a tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you were able to do that, if you decided to do it that way, you would catch all politicians in Australia. It is all very well to push aside His Honour's quite deliberate and premeditated remarks about this measure but he, of course, is of the view that it will not, and cannot, apply to members of the federal parliament, let alone the state parliaments. We all know that this measure of itself cannot apply to the majority of parliamentarians in Australia. That is what the government's decision means. This measure does not, and cannot, apply to state politicians, whereas, if the government were to have adopted the realistic attitude from the start and called this for what it is, namely, a tax, it would have been able to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand what Senator Allison said about equity of input, the fairness of what goes in, and that the tax treatment is really what comes out. She is of the view that that ought to be dealt with in some other way. But the fact is that we are dealing with this
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3041"> measure under the tax system as it stands. The fact is that contributors to, and the beneficiaries of, superannuation funds&mdash;those that take the benefit by way of pension or annuity&mdash;are discriminated against when compared to those who take it as a lump sum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to say anything more about this. As I said, I will not press my proposed amendment to a division in this chamber. I think it is totally unfair of the Assistant Treasurer to accuse the opposition of proposing an amendment which would in their view improve my amendment. That is what they have done. My final word is really an appeal to the Australian Democrats because, as I recall, the Australian Democrats did say that their view was, really, to `keep the bastards honest', although that may have been some time ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have a situation where the government was elected on the promise that there would no new taxation measures in their first term. It has now been determined by the Senate that this is a taxation measure. We all knew it was a taxation measure; now it will be regarded legislatively as a taxation measure. As I understand it, the Democrats voted for this measure to be regarded as a taxation measure. I appeal to the Democrats to oppose a third reading of this measure because, by so doing, it will keep the government honest with respect to its election statement, which many people regarded as very important in the scheme of things prior to the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my belief that, if the Democrats were to do this, there would be the numbers in the Senate to defeat this measure. The government could then take it back and rewrite the legislation so as to make it more equitable through the use of its taxation powers.</PARA>

This provides for exemptions for up to $2,000 in contributions for all existing superannuation accounts established by 7 May. After that time the threshold will not apply. That will prevent high income earners from opening multiple superannuation accounts of under $2,000 and avoiding this tax. Before that tax can be applied, the tax office will have to write initially to warn them that the surcharge will apply if they do not respond to the request by the superannuation funds for their tax file number and then a second time to each of the two addresses, residential and workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With these amendment we aim to protect the workers already in the superannuation system.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Amendments Nos 9 and 10 go to what we believe is a very important principle in the event&mdash;and we know that it will occur in respect of some people&mdash;of the collection of the tax from those earning less than $70,000. Regardless of the final number and regardless of the amount that is collected from those people, it is being taken out of their superannuation account and taken into the tax office and consolidated revenue. In taking it from a superannuation account&mdash;and these are people who should not be subject to this new 15 per cent tax on superannuation; the government has said that it is refundable if people go along and collect it, but we believe there are a lot of problems with that which I will not extensively debate&mdash;people who earn less than $70,000 are forgoing money that would have gone into their superannuation account.</PARA>

The deduction limit for the employer must not exceed the minimum contribution that the employer is required to make under those provisions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We are dealing now with amendments to make sure that an employer must not claim a deduction for contributions made on behalf of an employee unless the contributions are contributions which the employer is required to make under section 20 or 21 of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This deals with what we call the second simple idea of the superannuation contribution schemes. The first simple idea was that the rich ought to pay a reasonable, fair amount of tax. The second simple idea is that salary
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sacrifice is a problem that is mostly used by the rich. We would like to avoid a situation where people use a salary sacrifice measure in conjunction with their employer to avoid tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue here is fairly straightforward. Currently the law is that if a taxpayer is employed and their employer can claim deductions under section 82AAT of the ITAA, there are limits to deductions but deductions are fairly extensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first $3,000 of contributions are tax free from the standpoint of the employer. After that, only 75 per cent of contributions are deductible. The remaining 25 per cent is classed as a non-deductible contribution; hence, it cannot be used to reduce tax paid by employers at the company rate of 36 per cent. In other words, contributions equivalent to nine per cent of a salary of $461 a week are tax free and afterwards are taxed at an effective rate of nine per cent within the limits set by subsection 2A(c), which allows a maximum deduction of $25,000 for workers aged 35 to 49 and higher still for workers 50 and over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An employee can make additional contributions, but these come from income that is already taxed at marginal rates. In the case of someone earning $70,000, this would be 47 per cent&mdash;higher than the proposed 30 per cent of current tax plus surcharge. A self-employed or partially self-employed person can make their own contributions and claim deductions for them, also under section 82AAT of the Income Tax Assessment Act. This would include people who have intermittent incomes and are subject to the equalisation measures for taxation&mdash;farmers, writers, artists, athletes and the like. Again, there are limits to the deductions that can be claimed in any year, but deductible contributions are effectively tax free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once the money is contributed, it is taken to be income of the superannuation company and taxed at 15 per cent under section 26 of the Income Tax Rates Act. This 15 per cent tax was imposed in 1988 by the ALP over the strenuous objections of the coalition. The simple idea is to reduce tax benefits that provide opportunities primarily for high
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3047"> income earners with sufficient income that they can redirect some of it away from living costs. Wealthy employees, corporate executives and the like, take advantage of this not only without feeling restricted but also in a way that results in increased overall and long-term wealth and the maintenance of their high income status long after they cease to be productively employed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ending this situation is valid and an idea we support; however, the mechanism the government has chosen to pursue this goal is convoluted and awful. What this government has chosen to do is create a whole new structure so that superannuation companies must effectively vary their corporate tax rates on contributions, depending on the contributor's income. This is a violation of the principle that the rates act establishes rates for various general classes of taxpayers&mdash;residents, non-residents, businesses, et cetera&mdash;and for various general levels of assessable individual income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The actual detail about what income is assessable in the individual case is contained in the Income Tax Assessment Act. Here we see the government again muddying the waters, as they did with the family tax initiative, trying to make the rates act do the job of assessing individual circumstances, which is the proper place of the Income Tax Assessment Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Worse than that, they have violated another principle, which is that the taxpayer is liable for paying tax. Other persons, natural or corporate, are not liable for paying someone else's tax. The superannuation funds have so far been taxed in the rates act as businesses with income. The government now wants superannuation funds to act as agents of government and collect what amounts to personal income tax from contributors. This is not constitutional, nor is it logical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not simply making a change in the rate at which superannuation contributions are taxed; we are also asking superannuation companies to collect and pay some portion of the income tax owed by individuals and so get access to their financial information to do so. We should have done this in a simple way. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the objective was to reduce tax minimisation through salary sacrifice packages which increased employer superannuation contributions, then the obvious thing to do is to try to restrict the amount of superannuation contributions a company can make over that obliged by the superannuation guarantee legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If the intention was to increase the tax obligations of the rich, an increase in the highest tax margin or the creation of a new tax margin should have been undertaken. We have got amendments here to do both. The amendment we are speaking to first would limit 82AAT deductions by employers to the level they are required to make. In other words, they get no deductions for higher levels of superannuation contributions, and so such contributions will be taxed at the company rate of 36 per cent. Salary sacrifice packages may continue since 36 per cent is lower than the current top marginal rate of 47 per cent paid by those with income of over $50,000. The level of tax would be higher, however, than the level where the contributions were deductible under the current regime and then taxed at 30 per cent&mdash;that is, 15 per cent tax plus 15 per cent surcharge, which, of course, is tax as we know it. It will also apply to any worker getting a salary sacrifice tax minimisation deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will not end such schemes but it will reduce their attractiveness. It will result in less money going from the rich to superannuation. Of course, so will the government's scheme. I do not think there is much difference between our plan and the government's in terms of the effect on superannuation contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Encouraging savings is obviously not on the government's agenda. I do not see why tax minimisation and higher retirement incomes for the rich should be justified by the savings argument. Our plan will have the effect of increasing tax on required employer contributions, even for the rich. Somehow it is hard to justify requiring people to put in superannuation and then penalising through it. Either superannuation is something that government is prepared to create incentives for or it is not. If it is not, the simplest thing would be to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3048"> simply eliminate all deductions for contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also possible to say that employer superannuation contributions are a fringe benefit or remuneration and thus tax liability lies with the recipient of benefits taxed as FBT or a component of employee income taxed at the appropriate marginal rate. Our plan will avoid the need for a change to the taxation of superannuation companies and avoid the need for them to try to do the ATO's business of collecting individual financial records of contributors who actually pay the taxes the ATO says are owing. It will avoid the issues of privacy and unconstitutionality arising from this. It will avoid further mucking up of the rates act. It will avoid the situation where superannuation contributions required by an employer are suddenly effectively taxed at rates of up to 30 per cent. It will avoid the situation where an employee on $69,999 suddenly finds that the addition of $1 in income can cost them $42 on a six per cent contribution or $63 on a nine per cent one, as will be required by 2002 to 2003. It will avoid problems for part&hyphen;time and casual workers in relation to tax file numbers. It will avoid the problem of industries having to come to grips with yet another new legal regime which will undoubtedly be further modified in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think our method is clean and direct. It can accomplish it by the simple addition of a few lines in the Income Tax Assessment Act rather than the establishment of seven new acts. The financial implications are uncertain since this would probably mean an end to this particular form of tax minimisation, but probably not alternative forms. It would be good for revenue.

Earlier this year the federal government gave a strong signal that it too wanted to reduce public servant superannuation down to SGC levels. We oppose sending that as a reference to the Senate super committee and we will oppose any legislation which tries to do so, yet this amendment seeks to sanction this approach for the private sector and for government business enterprises. Senator Margetts seeks to assure us that this is only to stop salary packaging, but we think it goes further.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak against the third reading of this package of superannuation legislation. This provision to supposedly surcharge&mdash;now tax&mdash;high income earners who earn more than $70,000 a year was announced in the budget in August last year. What do we have in reality? We have in reality a package of legislation that is seriously flawed in a significant number of ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government attempted to call this package of legislation a surcharge when the advice from everyone, including the government's own budget papers, indicated it was a tax. Why did the government call it a surcharge? Because they did not want to be seen to be breaching the fundamental commitment they gave at election time&mdash;no increase in existing taxes and no introduction of new taxes&mdash;so they called it a surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an endeavour to avoid embarrassment on this new tax, the government went one crucial and important step further. They were requiring the superannuation funds to collect the tax. That in itself has led to a further range of significant problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the Treasurer himself who finally confessed, when denying constitutional problems with this new 15 per cent tax, that it was actually based on the 15 per cent tax that applies when superannuation moneys are paid into superannuation. He admitted that his justification for the constitutionality of this surcharge, as he called it up to that time, was that it was based on an existing tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the advice we have received from a Federal Court judge, from Mr Rose QC, from all the tax accounting, legal and superannuation experts, is that it is a tax and that it fundamentally breaches the commitment given by the Liberal and National parties at the last election and the solemn promise the Prime
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Minister gave that there be would no introduction of new taxes and no increase in existing taxes. It is a $&half; billion new tax in the forward estimates, supposedly to be collected from higher income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is fundamentally wrong in principle. And it is fundamentally wrong in principle to call it a surcharge and not a tax even today, despite the budget papers and everyone else in the community calling it a tax. With even the Treasurer admitting that it is a tax and even Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, referring to it as a  tax in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> interview, there is still one person who refuses to call it a tax&mdash;and that is the Prime Minister. To this day, he still refuses to call a spade a spade and a tax a tax when it is clearly a tax. It is pleasing to see&mdash;to that extent anyway&mdash;that that is what the Senate has called it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By calling it a surcharge and collecting it indirectly through superannuation funds, a whole host of problems have arisen from this new measure. One is that the government cannot apply it to all Australians who earn more than $70,000. They cannot apply it to the states, to state politicians, judges and other state public servants, because they called it a surcharge and not a tax. The government would not be taxing those people directly because they cannot tax the states directly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has had to exempt serving judges and has to rely on the states agreeing&mdash;and we have no agreement from any state yet&mdash;to somehow collect the tax that results from this package of legislation from those state employees. We are not confident that that is going to occur. The government has no agreement. It is now May; this provision was announced last August.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that what will emerge is two classes of employees. There will be an extraordinary tax that taxes Commonwealth employees and private sector employees earning more than $70,000 a year&mdash;with the exception of judges&mdash;but it will not tax the same class of employees working for state governments. That would be an extraordinary application of a tax. We certainly cannot recall any other tax that applies in that way to Australians.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3051">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are constitutional problems and significant legal questions that still remain over the legislation we have considered in the Senate over the last week. Initially, we had a view from Mr Rose QC that the legislation was unconstitutional because of clause 34. The government said, `No, no problem, no worry. It is constitutional.' Treasurer Costello, Prime Minister Howard and Assistant Treasurer Kemp were all in the media reassuring everyone there was not a problem; it was all constitutional and there was no problem with clause 34. And what happened? A few weeks later the government rushed amendments in to the House of Representatives to take care of that problem&mdash;it believes it has taken care of it; it may have created a whole series of other legal problems as a result of what they have done&mdash;to remove clause 34.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, only a fortnight ago, we had strong criticism from Justice Davies, a serving Federal Court judge, as to the constitutionality of the amended package that we have considered. That criticism went to the potential problem that this package of legislation does not cover existing federal politicians or existing federal judges. That is a severe problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be absurd and ridiculous if this legislation is found not to apply to existing politicians, and yet we may face that as the minimum of constitutional problems that arise from this package of legislation. Justice Davies and indeed a number of other legal experts have put a question mark over the whole package of legislation. So the whole legislation may fall over at some future date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The further problem that has emerged is the collection mechanism, because the government is refusing to call it a tax and is collecting it indirectly through the superannuation funds who do not have the tax file numbers to identify who earns more than or less than $70,000. If they called it a tax and applied it directly, the government would not have that problem but no, it has to be applied indirectly. By the government doing it that way, there would have been and there still will be a significant number of people earning less than $70,000 who will be caught in the tax net.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Initially, the government's approach was to hold up its hands and say that nobody who earns less than $70,000 need be caught by this tax, knowing full well that the funds do not have the tax file numbers and that the tax will apply automatically to anyone who does not provide a tax file number. We know through experience with the superannuation industry that the number of people who do not provide tax file numbers will be very significant indeed; there will be people who have to pay this tax at the full 15 per cent rate who earn less than $70,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the issue of what happens when a worker is made redundant. The government's definition of income included eligible termination payments, leave, and such things as retention bonuses that the military receive. There were significant problems with the definition of income and the application of this new tax to people earning less than $70,000 in a redundancy situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have the problem that even today, actuaries, who are expected to provide advice in the case of defined benefit funds, cannot provide detailed advice to individuals about what their new tax liability will be. There are hundreds of thousands of persons in defined benefit funds in that situation. It is not good enough that some nine months after the budget, individuals still cannot be advised by actuaries&mdash;I do not blame the actuaries&mdash;of the extent of their tax liability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have touched briefly on all of the issues that we have highlighted in this debate and over the last nine months since the announcement of this measure. But there are two particular inequities that Labor will not accept under any circumstances. This measure purportedly, supposedly, is to tax high income earners, but the result will not be a tax just against high income earners. In part, we have dealt with people who are low and middle income earners earning less than $33,000 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the amendment that has been passed does not go far enough; it does not exempt lower and middle income earners who have a new fund after 7 May. Lower and middle income earners will be taxed if they do not provide tax file numbers. Given that there
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3052"> were one million superannuation accounts in the last year for which we were able to obtain statistics, there will still be a significant number of lower and middle income earners caught by this new tax despite the best endeavours of the tax office and the superannuation funds, which will be going through a very costly process to try to collect the tax file numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second fundamental principle was the issue of what happens to a worker who is made redundant. Some of our suggested amendments&mdash;for example, excluding leave from the definition of income&mdash;were accepted. But eligible termination payments were not. There are many workers who are paid in the form of an ETP, in addition to what is defined as a bona fide redundancy pay. There are many workers in that situation who will be caught by this new tax. That amendment did not go the whole way to addressing this second fundamental concern that Labor has with this package of legislation. Accordingly, we will be voting against the third reading of what we see as a grossly unfair tax measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conclude, I might say there have been a number of undesirable side effects as a consequence of the Liberal government's announcement in the budget last year and the debate that surrounded this legislation. I know that Senator Kemp wants to attribute to me all the blame for the debate that has occurred over the last nine months. I only wish I had that sort of influence, Senator Kemp; I certainly do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last nine months there has been a very extensive debate about the future of superannuation. One of the detrimental side effects is a lessening of confidence in superannuation, not just among high income earners making more than $70,000 but a questioning by people who earn less than $70,000 about the value of superannuation. They say to Labor, `The government has changed the goalposts on this issue. Why should we believe them? Why won't they change the goalposts again in the same way that they changed the goalposts in deeming superannuation at age 55?' They changed the goalposts then. There were significant complaints from the broader community about the change of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the goalposts in that area. In the same way, I am sure many people will complain that this government committed itself to a promise to pay a further three per cent into all Australian workers' superannuation accounts and we know that they will break that promise tomorrow night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have three very significant changes with respect to superannuation. A new tax will hit not just the defined higher income earners earning more than $70,000 but a significant number of people earning less than $70,000&mdash;lower and middle income earners. There are also two million people in this country earning between $35,000 and $70,000 a year. We have the fundamental effect of this surcharge package. We have the deeming of superannuation, when a person turns 55, coming in on 20 September and we will have tomorrow night's announcements.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the surveys that I have seen&mdash;and I saw one last week&mdash;show there is very significant confusion and growing concern among Australians about the future of superannuation and what people will ultimately collect when they retire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's approach on this tax measure has been to say, `We will consult.' But, fundamentally, they have not listened. It is not just my voice in the media complaining about the particular problems of this new tax. We have had a whole range of media commentators&mdash;economic commentators, journalists, tax lawyers, actuaries, accountants and superannuation funds&mdash;expressing their concern about this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that this measure is set to pass the Senate. That does not please Labor. We believe, for the reasons that we have outlined, that this is fundamentally bad legislation. It does not address the particular principles that have been raised that we sought to have addressed. It leaves a whole range of question marks over the outcome that will develop in the next year or two as a consequence of this legislation passing into law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be millions of letters sent out by the tax office and by superannuation funds to millions of taxpayers in this country. The significant cost of that alone will have to be borne by every member of a superannuation
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3053"> fund. Lower and middle income earners and higher income earners will all have to bear the cost of that. Whether it be $50 million, $100 million or more, it is a significant cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To what end? The higher income earners who are supposed to be hit by this measure alone will not be, and I have dealt with that matter. Many of those higher income earners who have the discretion to put that money into superannuation are repackaging. Yet the tax office advises us that they do not believe one dollar will be lost as a consequence of higher income earners repackaging. All the anecdotal evidence and the advice we have been given is that such repackaging will occur. We could have the ironical situation and the perverse situation and the quite wrongful situation that more tax is collected from people earning less than $70,000 than from those earning more than $70,000&mdash;more tax collected from more people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">History will tell us whether that is an accurate assessment. History will tell us whether the estimates of the extra administrative costs are in the range of $50 million or $100 million all up. History will tell us about the effect on low and middle income earners and those others earning less than $70,000. History will tell us whether the states legislate to collect this new tax. History will tell us whether redundant workers and a significant number of lower and middle income earners are hit through ETPs. History will tell us in the next year or two whether this package of legislation is struck down because of its lack of constitutionality in respect of either judges and federal politicians or every category of employee. History will tell us that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that history has already told us is that you cannot trust the Liberal Party with superannuation. You cannot trust this government with superannuation. Every action they have taken, every law they have attempted to enact in respect of superannuation since they came to government, has had the effect of wrecking superannuation, wrecking confidence and wrecking the final payout from workers' superannuation. Unfortunately, that trend will again be highlighted and continued in the budget tomorrow night.</PARA>

We have argued for reforms of what is, in effect, $7 billion worth of tax breaks on superannuation, and most of those tax breaks have flowed to high income earners.

So we think this legislation goes some way to address that question which has so favoured high income earners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that we are interested in the fact that the ALP, having failed to address this question, is now proposing to vote against the third reading of this bill. We would, of course, have preferred an alternative collection mechanism, and we have said so on every possible occasion. This is a tax and, if it had been collected as a tax, a lot of those problems which will arise from this collection method would have been alleviated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators Harradine and Sherry might be right in terms of the constitutional issues and other administrative problems which have been raised, but we take the view that the government has to wear that. The government will need to address those issues as they arise, and so it should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We sought successfully to bring about changes to the bill which will protect low income workers. We have done that without opening up this bill to abuse and to tax avoidance. So, whilst this bill is not perfect by a long shot and it is not how we would have framed up the legislation, I indicate that the Democrats will support this bill in its current form.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens quite clearly indicated that it is very rare that we do see governments moving to get a fairer tax take from the rich in society who can afford to provide a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3054"> greater contribution at a time when we are seeing that there is a push to reduce taxes in general. Governments are using that as an excuse to reduce services provided to often the most vulnerable in our society, and we get an increased user-pays scenario in our society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens are opposed to this direction in which we are going. Therefore, we are concerned that any moves to oppose the bill in general will be used as an excuse in the future for the government to say, `Look, we made an effort to take more from those people who can afford it to contribute to tax revenue, and the Senate opposed it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I have to say that the Senate did come up with some very useful suggestions in relation to making this fairer. It was not really possible to make it a reasonable collection method. The bill was not set out as a reasonable collection method. Of course, the best way would have been for the Senate to decide as a majority that the bill should have gone back and should have been reworked over altogether. However, although there was a lot of support for that in the Senate, that approach was not supported by the Democrats. So we have been left with trying to fix up what is, in fact, an appallingly constructed bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were other opportunities to improve this bill in relation to actually looking at fairness for those people who do not earn anything near $70,000. What we have ended up with is a mishmash of halfways. The only reason that mishmash has occurred is that the amendments of the ALP and some of our amendments did not get that support. In fact, the government ended up agreeing to other halfway measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have is a badly constructed bill because, unfortunately, the Democrats allowed it to happen. Unfortunately the bill has not been improved or brought up by the bootstraps in relation to issues. It is a bill that has been made a lot worse than it needed to be. That is very sad in relation to the way the Senate is currently moving at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with great regret that I say we will still be supporting the bill. Those who realise how bad the bill is, compared with the fact it could

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All the issues have been extensively canvassed in this debate and in the period leading up to the debate. These are measures about equity and about fairness. I have to say that one of the most interesting developments that has come out in this debate is the fact that the Labor Party has finally revealed its true colours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party indicated with a lot of fanfare that it sought to back out from its leader's commitment to support the 15 per cent surcharge. Make no doubt about it: Mr Beazley indicated that the Labor Party would be supportive of the 15 per cent surcharge. What do we have today? Senator Sherry backing out. The modern Labor Party is not about equity; it is not about fairness. The modern Labor Party was worried about some of its mates. The Labor Party succumbed to pressure. At the end of the day, the Labor Party will not be supporting this measure, which is about equity and fairness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again put on the record that I believe that no Labor Party in Australian history would have opposed such a measure, which is about fairness and which is about equity. It says a lot about the modern Labor Party. They have refused to support a measure which will reduce the tax concessions available to those on higher incomes. Even Senator Sherry indicated that the test was whether we could avoid imposing it on low and middle income concerns. I indicated that the government had taken major steps to make sure it was not imposed on low and middle income earners. Senator Allison's amendment further reinforces that. But, in the end, Senator Sherry decided that the Labor Party would, I think, very strangely&mdash;and given the historical perspective of what one would have expected a Labor party to do&mdash;not support this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issues regarding low and middle income earners have been effectively addressed. They were effectively addressed by the government. To the extent that there was any concern, they have been buttressed further by the amendment moved by the Democrats. Labor's attempt, in its support for the privi
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3055"> leges which are being given to higher income earners, to hide behind the pretence that low and middle income earners were going to be affected has been revealed as the utterly specious argument which was presented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, this was an important part of the last budget. It was one of the reasons why this budget was accepted as a fair budget. The government has always intended to proceed with it. We have consulted widely. Senator Sherry keeps on raising the approach or mechanism in relation to the way it has been collected. We have extensively covered that. Senator Sherry was never able to put forward any other option which was a workable option. This is a workable option. Compared to any other measure that Senator Sherry was able to put forward, it is a far more simple measure. I might say that this debate on surcharges and taxes, Senator Sherry, fools nobody.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reintroduction of the retirement savings accounts bills is a rather contemptuous act. The government brought these bills in last session and faced strong criticism generally over a number of issues. It received this criticism both in the committee and in this chamber. Ultimately, the government decided to use its numbers and ignore every bit of that criticism as contained in the amendments. Unfortunately, it did not understand the numbers and the implications of denying legitimate concerns, so the bill was defeated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time it might have been able to get the bill through by addressing at least the worst aspects of the legislation. They may have been able to get a senator or two on side but they did not do so. Instead, they treated the concerns raised by the Senate with such contempt that in the end the bill was defeated. The government had the numbers to stop every amendment because, in the case of a tied vote, an amendment is lost. However, it did not have the numbers to actually pass the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems, however, that in the non-sitting period the government went to the Democrats and said, `We will make a few cosmetic changes so you can claim to have improved another awful bill.' On that issue, I would like to say plainly that the Democrats cannot in any way claim as a win a bill that might have got through if improvements had been made. We are now dealing with a bill that was defeated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are responsible for a Lazarus act having raised this bill from the dead. They, therefore, are solely responsible for every flaw in this bill that survives. It was dead and only lives again by their grace. They cannot claim that the government had them over a barrel and it was a tough negotiation.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3060"> The government in fact had no leverage on this one and they therefore must take responsibility for every single rotten item that survives in this bill. In any case, our position remains the same. We do not like the retirement savings accounts and see no reason for them. There is no advantage for anyone but the banking industry. We do and will oppose these bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We continue to have specific and strenuous objections to several issues, the main one being any situation where a default option for workers is something other than superannuation. I oppose totally the situation where an employer can decide an employee will enter into an RSA. I do not believe the amendments before us totally deal with this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I oppose totally a situation where there is any difficulty for an employee to transfer to a superannuation fund and have their employer honour that choice. I strongly dislike a system, whatever cautions are included, where the employer can put an employee in a RSA even when the employee can opt to go for a superannuation fund. This is not choice. This is allowing employers to skew the system towards banks and towards a retirement savings option that brings low returns for employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Superannuation funds produce better performance for virtually any employee. One might say that there are other better options which produce a better performance than superannuation funds, but that choice seems to have taken away from us a couple of years ago. I could accept a situation where the retirement fund contributions of all employees were placed into a superannuation fund unless the employees specifically asked to have them in an RSA. I could see a situation where only a specific request directly from an employee, separate from any other signed document, would result in an employer depositing an employee's money into an RSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to see the employee nominate the RSA if they chose to belong to one. I would like to see the situation law where if there is no signature or specific request initiated by the employee, separate to anything in general employment or conditions of employment agreements, it always means that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the employee wants to be in a superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agreed to some of the Democrat amendments last time, including to clause 15, because the ALP amendments were opposed and, if the bill was to get up, it seemed preferable to have a clause that would at least require an employer to offer superannuation membership along with any offer of a RSA. I am not quite so disposed to support this as the price to allow this bill to pass.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I clearly reject the right of an employer to influence in any way the membership of an employee in a retirement savings account. An offer can be made in coercive ways or set up in ways that result in them being accepted if there is a lack of thought or sufficient examination of the material and options. Those people who do not think coercion exists in the workplace have a lot to learn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may have been some Democrat amendments that I would still support if the ALP amendments were to have been put up, but it seems that they are not going to be. Those were the ones that amplify the ALP amendments rather than substitute for them. That would indicate that there is not a lot of point in window dressing. I would, for example, have supported measures to ensure that employees are not only given accurate information about performance and investment portfolios of RSAs but also information that contains specific cautions about the low returns and the drawbacks of such accounts. I would like to have seen RSAs take on a trustee&hyphen;like duty in relation to members and ethical options offered as alternatives within a bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the whole, I had intended to support the ALP amendments if they had put them again. There is also an amendment from Senator Harradine which I will support. As the ALP amendments will not be put up, I do not intend to support watered down versions of amendments put by the Democrats and potentially drafted by the government so that this bill can be raised from the dead. If the government wants these amendments, let them vote for them and make the situation here quite clear. Regardless of any amendments, I will still be opposing this bill. I do not think
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3061"> there are any real advantages to consumers&mdash;any advantages are mainly to banks&mdash;to be gained by having retirement savings accounts legislated in this way.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment of the Democrats and the government that we are currently considering relates to the regulation of RSAs as a low cost product. I will make a few comments about that shortly. Firstly, Labor's fundamental concerns about RSAs as a product were extensively canvassed prior to Easter when we debated this legislation. We moved a range of amendments to address those fundamental concerns. With very few exceptions, those amendments were not accepted by the Senate and by the government. As Senator Margetts has indicated, the government discovered it had the votes of half the Senate to not have our amendments passed but it did not have a majority to pass the legislation at the end of the debate on the third reading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have since examined the package of amendments that have come from the government and Democrat negotiations over the last few weeks. Without exception, they water down, where they deal with the protections that we sought to build into retirement savings accounts, the significant concerns and the range of amendments that Labor proposed to this legislation on the last occasion. It is regrettable that the Democrats have seen fit to succumb to the government's pressure with respect to watering down the amendments. Many of the amendments that they are supporting as part of this deal today they did not support on the previous occasion. This retirement savings legislation does not involve any change to the bottom line of the budget. So the Democrats have not even got the excuse that the government will be forgoing revenue as a consequence of the defeat that they received prior to Easter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I remarked earlier, the Labor opposition could go back and move all of its amendments. In light of the legislative pressure and time constraints that are on the Senate, that would be an irresponsible approach given that there is a locked in deal between the govern
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment and the Democrats. So one by one we will address the Democrat amendments that are being moved and indicate relatively briefly what our concerns are about those amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The specific amendment that we are dealing with here relates to the regulation of RSAs as a low cost product. Senator Margetts is correct; her recollection of amendments that went to the fees and charges that could be made with respect to RSAs&mdash;which she supported, Labor supported and, as I recall, the Democrats supported on the last occasion&mdash;was that it should be a no fees and charge product, not a low cost product, whatever that will mean. It should be a no fees and charge product, because this is a low return product. It is a guaranteed low return product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt, no argument, no disagreement that money in RSAs will return a lower interest rate over the longer term than traditional superannuation products. Why should RSAs, in those circumstances, be subject to low fees and charges&mdash;whatever that means in the context of bank fees and charges? There is significant community concern about what exactly is meant by a low cost product with respect to RSAs and, indeed, any fees and charges that are applied by banks. From my discussions with the banking industry, they recognise that it is a significant concern in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Banks have always argued&mdash;some more strenuously than others&mdash;that they need access to superannuation money. That is a fundamentally flawed argument. They have access, through their wholesale management arms, to significant proportions of superannuation savings in this country. Indeed, many of the banks have very successfully accessed, in the wholesale market, superannuation savings in this country. But fundamentally, what banks want is a retirement savings account similar in nature to the old savings account&mdash;a passbook product. It is a product that, for a range of reasons, most consumers lock themselves into for a long period of time with a low rate of return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The banks, very successfully of course, use the significant amounts of capital accumula
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3062"> tion through those passbook type accounts. In many ways, retirement savings accounts represent a similar approach by a number of the banks&mdash;lock in low return savings for as long as possible. In fact RSAs as superannuation accounts lock in the money much more closely to the banks than ever the traditional passbook type account was able to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last 10 years or so, if passbook type savings had any virtue, it did have non&hyphen;existent or extremely low fee and charges. But, of course, that era of the banks has passed. We are talking about workers' retirement savings that will inevitably be locked into these products for a long period of time&mdash;not necessarily by virtue of the regulatory regime that surrounds RSAs but by the inertia of a majority in the superannuation market not understanding that fundamental distinction between RSAs, a low return product, and the type of return their product would attract in other superannuation products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot believe the naivety of people who put forward the argument that, `Yes, the customer will be informed; they will transfer their money into a higher return product.' Why would a bank want to actively pursue that course when customers are a part of a low return product? The bank fundamentally will want to keep that money there for as long as possible. The comments that I have made are but a brief overview of the issue relating to fees and charges and RSAs being a low cost product&mdash;whatever that means&mdash;in the context of the agreement between the government and the Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not trust this government on superannuation. We do not trust the fundamental changes they have made and will announce tomorrow night in the budget with respect to superannuation. It will add to cost, to fees and charges and, inevitably, to a lower level of savings in superannuation and a lower return and to a lower retirement outcome for Australians. That is our fundamental bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does surprise me is that the government has not learnt from the experience of retirement savings account products in the United Kingdom. I do know that the government has in part modelled the concept and the principle of its legislation on what has occur
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> red in the United Kingdom with respect to personal superannuation products. In the United Kingdom we do know that the individual superannuation products, under the then conservative government of Prime Minister Thatcher, encouraged people&mdash;through a variety of measures, including `incentives'&mdash;to take out these individual account type products. As a result, well in excess of a million consumers in the United Kingdom were ripped off, and that is not putting it too emotionally or too simply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The studies that have occurred of these individual savings retirement vehicles in the United Kingdom show that well over a million people are going to have to be compensated because of the fees and charges that were made in respect of these individual superannuation savings vehicles. This government, in its ideological zeal, not learning from the conservative governments of the United Kingdom, has decided to repeat to a significant degree that approach in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor started from the initial position that if there could be adequate safeguards built around retirement savings accounts we would accept the concept. That is why we moved our amendments on the previous occasion. We do not believe that on these amendments the safeguards are adequate and meet the minimum principle in respect of fees and charges that we put forward on the last occasion. We do not accept this particular proposal of the Democrats and the government. We do not agree with it. We know it is futile to move the amendments we moved on the previous occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that in this area the Democrats did give support, but they have since done a retreat. I think, in the context of this issue, the overall package the Democrats have reached in respect of the government does not provide sufficient safeguards for individuals in respect of retirement savings accounts. We will obviously touch on and develop some of those issues as we move through the amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will be supporting the amendments the Democrats have moved. I will make a few brief preliminary comments. About 40 minutes ago we were subjected to a lecture from Senator Margetts about broken promises. The introduction of RSAs is an election promise of the coalition government. You, who incorrectly argued that we were breaking a promise, should bear in mind that the reason we are bringing this back is that it was an election promise. We believe there is room for such a product and we have long argued that in previous debates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is correct that, with the failure of the bills through the Senate, the government sat down and was prepared to constructively negotiate with all groups to see whether we could reach accommodation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The operation of the amendment has the effect of ensuring that an employer cannot open an RSA on behalf of an employee unless the employee has been provided with application forms for the relevant industry super fund or, if there is no industry super fund, another superannuation fund and the RSA offered by their own bank. They will have 28 days in which to make up their minds before the employer can act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment also contains a significant change from my former amendment No. 15, in that the employer will not be allowed to open an RSA if they are already paying into a superannuation fund or RSA on behalf of the member. This additional requirement in 51A(4)(e) meets a key concern that has been raised by unions. I think it is a fair balance between providing employees with choice whilst also ensuring that employers are able to meet their superannuation guarantee legal obligations.</PARA></SPEECH>

I do not think that a lot of employees, if they are already in the hospitality fund, will believe they should or would have to sign another form&mdash;or a letter to their employer, or signify to their employer&mdash;to rejoin the hospitality fund. Why should they? Why would they believe that they have to do this?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add to the remarks I made a moment ago. Senators Conroy and Sherry seem to be suggesting that we are going to have massive changes here. They cite the hospitality industry as being a likely area in which this would occur. I suggest that it is unlikely in the extreme that in that industry in particular the employers will even bother with wanting to offer an RSA. I remind the Senate that this is not an obligation on the employer to always offer an RSA. I imagine that the employer would only do so in circumstances where there was not an enormous number of employees coming and going from periods of employment. It would be much easier for the hospitality industry to continue to send contributions for those who are employed in the industry to the industry fund. I cannot imagine that there would be any change to that.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am not throwing it away without thinking about it at all. I have looked at it and thought, `I do not need to fill this industry fund form out because I am already in it.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish I could live in a world where there was only one industry fund in my industry, say, the teaching profession&mdash;that is, where I would be offered one fund that covers my industry or an RSA. In the real world&mdash;for people, say, in the hospitality industry or the retail industry&mdash;there are actually competing industry funds, Senator Allison. Some of them are employer front industry funds because they could not bear the prospect of being in an industry fund with a trade union. They actually set up rival funds purely on the basis of refusing to participate in a fund that had anything to do with the trade union movement. That is actually what happens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we have designated that there are going to be two pieces of paper handed to a prospective employee to choose between an industry fund and the RSA, it is a matter of which industry fund. Who gets to choose which industry fund is being presented to the employee? It is the employer. If the employer is part of one of these industry funds or is one of those out there that hates trade unions they would perhaps not present the industry fund that the employee was previously in. This could happen because they are committed to be anti-union companies. They do exist out there. I would have thought the teaching profession in Victoria would have come across an anti-union employer in the last few years, but perhaps not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I am making is that not all industry funds are the same. Not all industry funds have the same low cost structures. Not all industry funds have the same good performance. Where is the choice? Do not stand up in the chamber and say that this legislation is about increasing choice. Choice, as far as the Democrats are concerned, lasts for 28 days and after 28 days the choice is gone. This is a piece of legislation that reduces choice. Your amendments simply keep a bit of extra choice in place for 28 days and after 28 days this legislation goes back to what it

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a piece of legislation that is supposed to be about improving choice, but it reduced choice six weeks and you voted against it on the basis that it reduced choice. Your amendments simply mean that choice is there for an extra 28 days. There is no choice for the employee about which documentation he or she receives. If there is a range of different industry funds&mdash;and some of them in the transport industry, and I am sure other industries, are quite poor performers and high cost&mdash;the employee will be faced with a choice between an industry fund that is poor performing and high cost or an RSA which has a low return. That is what happens in the real world. That is what the Democrats said they were opposed to six weeks ago. You want more choice, but you have signed up to a bit of legislation that reduces choice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Allison, what I am more than curious about with regard to the Democrats' position is that you say that you have taken measures to protect workers and provide greater choice for workers, et cetera. If we take that at face value and accept that you have done those things, with regard to the amounts of money that we know are likely to go into these accounts, what are you going to do with regard to the interest that is paid to those accounts? I would also be interested in the minister's response to this. Regardless of the fact that you may think that workers will have more choice, in many cases the reality
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3079"> will be exactly as it has been put: there will not be the choice, as is quite often the case now where there are industry funds. Because employers do deals with insurance companies, workers are forced to have their superannuation with a particular company, whether they have got an industry fund or not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the fundamental issues in this legislation is where people are able to put their money. We are talking about retirement savings accounts. In the main, probably small amounts of money will be involved. I am sure you are aware of the rates of interest. I know that Senator Kemp would be, but of course it would not worry him too much because he would have enough money to make sure he is earning the top interest rate. The Temporary Chair, Senator Ferguson, would too, but he might not admit it. The great bulk of Australian workers who will find themselves being lumped in RSAs&mdash;a lot of them will be part-time workers&mdash;will not get any interest on their money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Reserve Bank bulletin of April 1997 says that Australian banks pay no interest on $14.8 billion of Australian depositors' funds&mdash;none, zip. Senator Allison, I am sure you are fully aware of the stepped interest rates that banks apply to deposits. I would suggest that you and the Democrats look very hard at the issue of interest rates and how they might be applied to RSAs. I for one am not going to vote to give away more money of Australian workers, particularly those who are in the position to least be able to afford it. We ought to be doing everything to ensure that the money that such people are able to pay into some sort of retirement fund earns the maximum amount of interest to ensure that, at the end of the day, they have the best amount of money available to them in their retirement. You should not be voting for or even supporting legislation that in any way, shape or form will designate most of their money into funds that will earn them no interest at all.</PARA></SPEECH>

However, it does seem bizarre that we could not have competition in superannuation.

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments mirror amendments 19 to 21 and 24, which I moved on the last occasion we considered this legislation. They seek to prevent an employer from accepting inducements from an RSA provider for signing up their employees to an RSA. These amendments meet the concern on third line forcing that the Australian Consumers Association reported to the Senate committee, and I commend them to the committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These amendments are okay as far as they go, but when compared with the totality of the amendments moved with respect to what is commonly known as third line forcing, they are not as strong. I do not wish to take too much of the time of the committee by going over the arguments that were traversed on the previous occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly in principle, RSA providers should not be permitted in any way, shape or form to offer any form of inducement. We do not cast aspersions on the ethical behaviour of the providers or the employers, but it is regrettable that there will be an element amongst some of the employers who will engage in such behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor cannot stress enough that it is very concerned about low income earning employees, particularly casual and part&hyphen;time employees, who are very vulnerable in that type of employment situation. As limited as these particular provisions the Democrats are inserting are, there will still be significant difficulties created for employees where an employer `suggests'. You can outlaw such behaviour all you like, but the majority of employees, particularly in those low paying, casual, part-time positions, are particularly open to coercion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employees who are in a vulnerable employment position may suffer serious, long-term consequences that will be detrimental to their
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> future financial security. Superannuation, as we have noted, is a compulsory saving. It is money that employees go without in order to save for retirement. It is not acceptable that employers can enter into any sort of arrangement with any financial institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was argued on the previous occasion that the Trade Practices Act in respect of third line forcing would prevent this type of situation. The government assured us on that occasion that this sort of behaviour would be outlawed by the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In evidence before the Senate committee, the Australian Consumers Association certainly did not believe the Trade Practices Act would be sufficient. They also gave evidence that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission had been unable to prosecute financial institutions on the basis of section 47. I have had a number of private meetings with a number of people in this area since the Senate last considered this package of legislation. This legislation is fine as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough in protecting consumers. We regret that. We regret and are very concerned about the weaker position the Democrats have retreated to in totality with the proposed safeguards in this package since the Senate last considered this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already touched on our concerns about issues relating to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, the role of trustees and a number of other concerns which are not addressed by this package of legislation, in particular the provisions outlined in the clauses we are considering in respect of the types of behaviour that certainly some employers and financial institutions may engage in. It will be interesting to look at the way in which RSAs emerge over coming years to see the pattern that emerges and, coincidentally, to see the relationship between those employees in a particular product, particularly those offered by a bank. I think we will see a not unsurprising coincidence between the RSA products that employees are in and the banking or other financial arrangements of their employer.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Except as provided otherwise in this Act, every director of an RSA institution is subject to the same duties and under the same liability in respect of an act or omission in relation to a trust or fiduciary duty as if he or she had been a trustee and as if RSA holders had been beneficiaries of such a trust, unless the director proves that the act or omission occurred without his or her knowledge and that he or she used all due diligence to prevent the act or omission.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The question remains, having regard to what we just did a moment ago, as to whether we should include the latter words relating to due diligence to prevent the act or omission. The committee might like to consider that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I put this forward on the last occasion on 25 March, this measure was adopted by the Senate; it was passed. It was supported by the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the Greens. When it was passed, although the legislation was ultimately defeated, there was a tremendous reaction from the banking industry&mdash;an overwhelming reaction. They were cranking up their very well oiled machine to have me see the error of my ways.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3084">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The error of my ways apparently was that there should be a fiduciary duty imposed on the banks&mdash;in respect of what? Money that is submitted and paid into retirement savings accounts for workers and their dependants for retirement. The suggestion was that that fiduciary duty would place the directors of banks in a situation of conflict with their responsibility as directors of the institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, before I address the issue, I believe&mdash;and I think the chamber would believe also&mdash;that it should be the case that such moneys do have protection that would be given by my amendment over the interests of, say, foreign shareholders of banks. The philosophy behind this measure is very clear: trustee duties and liabilities ought to be imposed on institutions taking money of those seeking to provide for themselves or their dependants for the vicissitudes of life and including moneys that are paid in for the benefit of retirees and their dependants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not dealing with the bank's money; we are not dealing with life insurance company money; we are not even dealing with employer's money; we are dealing with the workers' money. It is money that is being set aside for workers&mdash;including those who may become disabled and thus need to retire&mdash;for their old age or for their widows and orphans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For centuries, the law of trusts has been a body of law to which we resort in order to impose obligations where one person entrusts funds to another for the purposes of providing for others. That has been recognised in the Life Insurance Act; that was enshrined in section 38(8). Unfortunately, while that principle was in the first print of the Life Insurance Bill 1994, it somehow later got dropped out without debate as the Life Insurance Bill went through the House of Representatives. No explanation was given to parliament as to why directors of life insurance companies were to be freed from trustee obligations. I gather that the suggestion has been made that the particular statutory duties set out in the Life Insurance Act 1945 are superior.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind senators, as I did when I dealt with this matter on a previous occasion, that the first draft of the bill did not have that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provision excised. I think this is a very important matter that we are dealing with. I have noted what was said in the cabinet&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence document that happened to be lying on this particular table. That document talks about the cabinet commitment which raises significant policy issues: namely, which financial institutions may provide RSAs directly without a trust structure, the regulatory regime that should apply to RSAs and the appropriate tax treatment of RSAs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My amendment does not suggest that there needs to be a separate trust structure at all. I know that has been suggested. I know that the banks have been running around the place frightening the life out of credit unions and so forth, making them fearful of what I am proposing to do. It is a nonsense. I know they have been doing that, and I know the government is very much behind it. My amendment does not require&mdash;and I invite the minister to prove that it does&mdash;RSA providers to set up a separate trust structure. All it does is provide a holder of an RSA with appropriate protection by imposing the duties and liabilities of trustees on RSA providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt Senator Allison would have been told that my amendment would set up formal trust structures. That is what I heard her hint in her previous contribution. She has been told that, but it does not have to. It is recognised that some trustee obligations may be absolutely desirable. That should be recognised by the industry itself. I think that it would be unfair competition if superannuation funds holding superannuation savings were subject to trustee obligations but other institutions were not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government is all about free and fair competition, what about making it free and fair? For competition to be free and fair, similar products receiving similar tax treatment for similar purposes should have similar obligations on the providers. I point out that at a technical level debtor-creditor relationships and trustee beneficiary relationships can co&hyphen;exist in one transaction. I refer to the Quistclose Investments v. Barclays Bank case. Parliament previously imposed trustee duties and obligations in respect of contracts of life insurance under the Life Insurance Act 1945,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3085"> as I mentioned previously. I believe it is most important for the protection of beneficiaries that the Senate again adopts the amendment that I am proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I point out that this approach is also followed in section 200 of the New South Wales Workers Compensation Act 1987, which imposes almost identical trustee duties and liabilities on the directors of insurance companies undertaking workers compensation business. Clearly the amendment that I am putting forward is consistent with existing policy and is consistent with other proposed amendments to this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By starting with the trustee concept, we will have a clear legislative framework on which to build. Any modifications or additions to trustee obligations can then be specifically set out in the act. I repeat: given the purposes for which the moneys are invested, the inequality of bargaining power and the trust and confidence which is reposed in these institutions, the law of contracts is not sufficient alone. The duties and liabilities of trustees are the essential foundations, in my view, that need to be laid for this act to work in the public interest. I again commend the amendment to the committee. I hope that the committee will do what it did only as recently as 25 March and adopt this particular amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, Labor broadly agrees with the position put by Senator Harradine. Before I go into some detailed remarks, I have to say, Senator Harradine, that if the banks were trying to get you to see the error of your ways, I wish them better luck than I have had on occasions since we have known each other. It is certainly not easy, once you have taken a position, to point you on to a different path on the basis of the error of your ways. Even though we do not agree on many occasions, I think that is to your credit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the amendment being put forward by Senator Harradine, as was pointed out by Senator Harradine, this was passed on the last occasion that the Senate considered this package of legislation. Senator Harradine's amendment goes to what I think can aptly be described as the heart of the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> protection mechanisms of the superannuation system. When Labor was in office in 1993, we introduced what was known as the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, which ensured one of the most rigorous protection regimes for superannuation and like products anywhere in the world. Essential to that, of course, is protection against theft and fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, we have seen in recent months&mdash;I saw this first-hand in Adelaide a week and a half ago when I met with some RetireInvest victims, but I will not go into the details of the particular problems involving RetireInvest&mdash;an increasing problem of theft and fraud in respect of post-superannuation moneys. After a person has collected their lump sum, they are then faced with making the choice of investment in a range of different entities. There do seem to be increases in theft and fraud occurring in that area, but that is not the subject of our debate tonight. We are looking at pre-retirement, where money is in the superannuation system while someone is employed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the banks in this case or the credit unions with superannuation moneys&mdash;compulsory saving for a person's retirement&mdash;will not be covered by the types of protection that the SIS Act offers in respect of trustees. The SIS legislation creates a trustee duty. This fiduciary duty creates a duty on behalf of the trustee to act on behalf of the beneficiaries. This is very different, we would contend, from the duty of a board of directors for a company in the case of the banking industry. This duty is onerous, and Labor does not shy away from ensuring that this duty and the responsibilities exercised by trustees are onerous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Trustees that are in the position of the investment management of workers' money for their retirement have an enormous responsibility. It is significantly greater than the responsibility placed on the directors of a corporation, and for good reason. Superannuation saving is a different form of saving. It is for retirement. It has to be guaranteed in the event of theft and fraud. There has to be a significant number of checks and balances that place that protection at a more significant level than other forms of saving. If the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3086"> government does not accept that as a principle, then I would like them to say it. If they believe that superannuation saving should be treated in exactly the same way as most other forms of saving, with less onerous responsibilities in respect of the supervision of that saving, let them say it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This RSA bill seeks to reduce the liability and responsibility of trustees. That is the effect of it. Labor cannot accept this position. RSAs are products relating to superannuation. As I have said, superannuation is a different type of saving from that of other bank products. As Senator Harradine and Labor senators and other senators have commented time and time again, superannuation is workers' retirement income. It is not typical of a normal bank decision where there is almost total freedom to move in and out subject to the particular requirements in respect of normal bank accounts. This is money that individuals are required to save for their old age and to live on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons we toughened up the regulation of superannuation considerably in the SIS Act was the Maxwell disaster in the United Kingdom. I visited first&hyphen;hand the United Kingdom during the lead-up to the preparation of that legislation, and I spent some time with those of the trustees that were around with the victims of that fraud case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was obvious was that, aside from the failure of the regulatory supervisors of the financial system in the United Kingdom, the trustee system in the Maxwell disaster did not work effectively. There was effectively no trustee checking the mechanism. There were trustees, but trustees in name only. The ability of Maxwell to access the life savings of thousands of members of superannuation funds that he effectively controlled is no different from the ability of bank officials on a bank board to carry out dishonest behaviour. It would be unfortunate if it were to occur, but it could happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">RSAs as outlined in this proposed legislation, which is being supported by the Australian Democrats, do not line up with the government's election promises. Senator Harradine has already referred to the cabinet&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence document that we have shown
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those responsible for the legislation in here tonight. We will support Senator Harradine's amendment. Superannuation is a different type of savings product. It is fundamentally different and there should be the most fundamental and absolute protections. In our view, Senator Harradine's amendment certainly accomplishes those fundamental and, in our view, almost absolute protections that are possible to design within a regulatory framework.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Issues</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rationale</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> RSAs will be a simple, low cost, low risk product especially suited to those with small amounts of superannuation, such as itinerant and casual workers, or those nearing retirement (wishing to minimise risk). Their introduction will complement existing superannuation arrangements by allowing banks and other institutions to provide cost efficient delivery of superannuation. This will enhance competition and choice in the superannuation industry, thereby putting downward pressure on fees and charges, and encouraging improved service delivery. Employers looking for a convenient vehicle for small Superannuation Guarantee contributions will benefit. Many employees will also benefit as RSAs will be convenient and flexible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In light of the advantages of RSAs and the Government's firm commitment to them, I consider that RSAs should be introduced as quickly as possible. In particular, I do not consider that there is any reason to defer the introduction of RSAs until after the Financial System Inquiry has reported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Trustee arrangements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> At present, complying superannuation products must generally be offered through a trust arrangement, under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (SIS Act), in order to qualify for superannuation tax concessions. Under this structure, the fund trustee is the legal owner of the fund assets, with members having a beneficial interest. Fund trustees are subject to fiduciary obligations under trust law (some of which have been codified and expanded in the SIS Act), and are required to comply with the SIS operating standards, designed to maximise the likelihood that the fund is managed prudently and for genuine retirement income purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Deposit takers such as banks, credit unions and building societies are already significant players in the superannuation market, through subsidiary companies (often life offices), which, like other superannuation providers, must currently operate their superannuation business under a trust structure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Life offices and complying superannuation funds, which are more like fund managers than deposit takers, currently offer a range of market&hyphen;linked and capital stable individual and group superannuation products using `public offer' superannuation entities whose trustees are subject to approval processes administered by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> From a member's perspective, an RSA would be more akin to a personal deposit account than a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pooled or collective investment. In effect, an RSA would be like a deposit account in the name of an individual but subject to preservation requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Where employees have limited control over their superannuation, trustees have an important role in protecting the interests of fund members. However, the case for a trust structure is weaker where the sponsoring institution is already subject to prudential supervision and where employees are able to rollover their superannuation into another fund if they so wish, and can look after their own interests. This will be true for RSAs, as each account is envisaged as a single superannuation fund where the account holder would be able to rollover the accumulated superannuation amounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Thus, legally, the trustee/beneficiary relationship for existing superannuation fund members could be replaced by a debtor/creditor relationship; in the case of bank, building society and credit union RSAs, or a direct contractual relationship with the policy holder for life office RSAs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the absence of a trust structure, the right to offer RSAs should be confined to financial institutions which are subject to prudential supervision by the Reserve Bank of Australia, (RBA), the Australian Financial Institutions Commission (AFIC) or the ISC, that is, banks, credit unions, building societies, and life offices. (The eligibility of friendly societies to offer RSAs will be reviewed if they come under AFIC supervision.) Public offer complying superannuation funds would continue to operate through a trust structure (as this is the basis of protecting the interests of fund members). However, such funds could offer products broadly equivalent to an RSA, if they so wished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The proposed arrangements are consistent with announced Government policy to allow banks, building societies, credit unions, life offices, and superannuation funds to offer RSAs for individual superannuation. However, other financial intermediaries, for example, friendly societies, do not operate under sufficiently rigorous prudential supervision arrangements to be able to offer RSAs at present. I am therefore proposing to limit RSAs to those institutions which operate under appropriate prudential regimes, pending any changes to supervision arrangements following the Financial System Inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Investment arrangements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For banks, building societies and credit unions, RSAs will be held directly on balance sheet and so will form part of the deposit base of the institution. As a result, funds deposited with RSAs will be invested in the same manner as other deposits of such institutions, that is, primarily in cash, securities, and bank loans. This would mean that RSAs offered by deposit taking institutions would effec
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3088"> tively be a capital guaranteed, low risk/low return financial product.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the absence of restrictions, RSAs offered by life offices could invest in a wider range of assets (including property and equities) and so would be more akin to a higher risk/higher return managed fund. In the interests of competitive neutrality, I propose that all RSAs must be capital guaranteed. This would effectively restrict the investments which can be made by life office RSAs, but ensure that RSAs offered by the different types of institutions are broadly similar. This approach is also consistent with the basic concept of RSAs being low risk niche products which supplement existing superannuation instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulatory regime</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Pending any changes to the regulatory regime which might arise from the Financial System Inquiry, RSA supervision would be split into two parts: relevant prudential supervision for institutional soundness, and ISC functional supervision of compliance with retirement income standards. That is, the prudential soundness of institutions offering RSAs would continue to be the responsibility of the relevant supervisor (the RBA, ISC, or AFIC), while the ISC would oversight RSA compliance with relevant retirement income standards. (These are the requirements imposed on complying superannuation funds to ensure that benefits are used for genuine retirement income purposes.) There will be no duplication of regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The retirement income standards to apply to RSAs will be tailored to address the particular features and risks associated with RSAs and will cover aspects such as eligibility to make contributions, controls on benefit payments (including preservation requirements), appropriate disclosure, annual reporting, registering of RSA providers, member protection for small superannuation contributions, complaints handling, allowable investments, use of Tax File Numbers, penalties and purchasing of life and disability insurance. Further details on the prudential supervision arrangements and proposed regulatory regime for RSA providers is at Attachment B.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxation treatment for RSAs</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The proposed taxation treatment for RSAs is outlined in Attachment C. These arrangements are designed to ensure that the superannuation tax concessions are afforded to RSAs in an administratively simple and neutral manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Possible limits on RSA balances</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Because RSAs are expected to be a relatively low return form of superannuation savings, they would not generally be suitable vehicles for accumulating superannuation savings over a whole lifetime. This has led some commentators to call for a mandatory cap on the maximum amount
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which an individual can hold in an RSA. I consider a mandatory cap of this kind would be difficult to enforce (an individual who wanted to keep their savings in an RSA would simply open a new RSA once they reached the cap) and would be inconsistent with individual choice. However, to protect members against accumulating too much of their superannuation in low yielding accounts, I propose that once an RSA balance reaches $10,000, the provider will be required to advise the account holder of the desirability of investigating higher yielding superannuation products. The terms of this advice may need to be determined by the ISC to ensure adequate disclosure.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This attachment provides detail on the proposed regulatory regime for RSAs.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The supervision of RSAs can be split into two parts: relevant prudential supervision for institutional soundness, and ISC functional supervision for compliance with retirement income and other superannuation standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prudential Supervision of Proposed RSA providers</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Banks are required to operate within a prudential framework which covers, among others, minimum capital requirements and liquidity management. Banks are prudentially supervised by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) under the Banking Act 1959. Contributions to bank RSAs would become part of the bank's deposit base and balance sheet, and subject to the present prudential framework applying to their other business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For building societies and credit unions, contributions to RSAs would also be part of the deposit base and balance sheet, and would be subject to State based supervision by the Australian  Financial Institutions Commission (AFIC). (The eligibility of friendly societies to offer RSAs will be reviewed if they come under AFIC supervision.) Minimum operating standards for these institutions are broadly similar to those applying to banks. The RSA business of building societies and credit unions would be subject to the present prudential framework applying to their other business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Contributions to life office RSAs would be channelled directly to a life office statutory fund and subject to ISC supervision under the Life Insurance Act 1995. Life offices are required to meet capital adequacy and other appropriate prudential standards, although on a different basis to those applying to banks, reflecting the different nature of the industry. The RSA business of life offices would be subject to the present prudential framework applying to their other business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Complying superannuation funds are supervised using a trust arrangement by the ISC under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision Act 1993 (SIS Act). These arrangements would continue and would permit public offer complying superannuation funds to offer products broadly equivalent to an RSA if they so wished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Retirement Income and Non&hyphen;Prudential Superannuation Standards</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> RSAs will generally be required to comply with retirement income and other non&hyphen;prudential superannuation standards currently outlined in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (SIS Act), income tax legislation and so on. These rules are quite detailed and the proposed treatment is outlined below. New legislation will be required to give effect to these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eligibility Rules/Contributions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> RSAs will be subject to the same eligibility rules for contributions as currently set out in the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3090"> SIS Act, Superannuation Guarantee (SG contributions for their employees, but the account should be held in the name of the employee, and the employer would not be allowed to prevent the employee from transferring the balance to another RSA or superannuation product.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In this context, RSAs would have to comply with the rules which currently refer to the eligibility of an individual to contribute (or have contributions made on their behalf) to a regulated superannuation fund, as currently outlined in Regulation 7.04 of the SIS Act (although under announced Government policy, these rules are likely to be relaxed). Currently, a regulated superannuation fund may generally accept contributions that are made in respect of a member who is under age 65 only if the member is in part&hyphen;time or full&hyphen;time gainful employment. "Part&hyphen;time" means gainful employment for at least 10 hours, and less than 30 hours, each week and `gainful employment' means employment or self&hyphen;employment for gain or reward in any business trade, profession, vocation, calling, occupation or employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are several exceptions to this general rule such that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) a member may contribute for up to two years after ceasing part&hyphen;time or full&hyphen;time gainful employment;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) a member may contribute if he or she ceased full&hyphen;time or part&hyphen;time gainful employment because of ill&hyphen;health (whether physical or mental); and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) a member on authorised leave from his or her employer in order to raise children may contribute for up to 7 years. The member must have a statutory or contractual right to resume employment at the end of the leave. He or she must have been a member of the fund immediately before going on leave, or the employer be a standard employer&hyphen;sponsor of the fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Investment Restrictions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Complying superannuation funds and life offices are not permitted to `gear up' their assets by borrowing, or to lend money to, or acquire certain assets from, members of a fund. It would not be appropriate or practicable for banks, building societies or credit unions to be subject to these restrictions because RSAs will not be segregated from other borrowing and lending activities of the institution. These rules will still continue to be relevant for RSAs provided by life offices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The prohibition on funds allowing members to secure borrowings against their superannuation benefits will apply to RSAs. Institutions will not be permitted to make loans to RSA account holders secured against assets in an RSA account. RSAs offered by banks will not be permitted to be subject to any account combination arrangements, or interest offsetting arrangements.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RSA Returns and Investment Rules</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> RSA products provided by banks, building societies and credit unions will be intermingled with other deposits and invested in the traditional manner (eg. cash, securities, and lending against secure assets). Such RSAs would, therefore, effectively be `capital guaranteed', low risk/low return financial products. Some equity investments by banks in non&hyphen;financial businesses are possible under recently amended Reserve Bank prudential rules, but these are subject to limits and are likely to remain small in the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This treatment implies that bank, building society and credit union RSAs would earn a rate of return broadly equivalent to that of a bank deposit. These institutions may choose to offer RSAs with a fixed interest rate (like a term deposit) or a variable rate. In general, RSAs could be expected to yield lower returns than a typical balanced fund (which invests in a wider range of assets, including equities and property).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To ensure that investors are aware of the returns on RSAs and can compare them to other products, RSAs should be required to report returns to account holders on a similar basis to other superannuation products, rather than use a standard bank statement. In addition, the low risk/low return nature of an RSA would need to be adequately drawn to the investor's attention at the time an account is opened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Current investment rules for life office statutory funds enable life offices to invest in higher yielding `growth' portfolios with property and stock market exposures. Superannuation funds also can invest in such portfolios. Hence, life office and superannuation products could potentially be riskier, market linked products, with potentially higher rates of return.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the absence of any restriction on life office investments, this would mean that RSAs sold by different agencies would be effectively two different products, notwithstanding the same generic name. This has considerable potential to cause confusion for consumers and is almost certain to give rise to `competitive neutrality' arguments by banks, credit unions and building societies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To overcome this problem it is proposed that all RSAs would be required to be `capital guaranteed'. (Life offices and public offer superannuation funds already offer `capital guaranteed products.) If necessary, this issue could be reviewed following the outcome of the Financial System Inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Addressing the Expected Lower Returns from RSAs</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As RSAs are likely to provide lower returns than other superannuation products, end benefits provided by RSAs will often be lower than provid
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3091"> ed by other `accumulation style' superannuation vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is often argued that low, stable returns are inappropriate for superannuation, which is a long term investment. However, RSAs should be seen as a low cost/low risk niche product which may suit people with small balances or who are nearing retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">21.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In view of the low return nature of RSAs, they would not be a suitable vehicle in which to accumulate superannuation savings over the whole of a person's working life. Modelling indicates that an increase in real returns from two to four per cent would increase a person's final benefits by about 60 per cent, from approximately five times their final salary to eight times their salary over a typical working life. There is, therefore, a strong case for encouraging RSA amounts to be transferred to higher yielding `balanced' funds at certain monetary levels. There are two options for dealing with this issue. One option is to require that the institution providing the RSA advise the account holder to assess alternative higher yielding superannuation investment opportunities when an RSA account balance reached a certain amount (say $10,000). This could be accomplished by a compulsory notice to RSA investors which describes switching options. This is the proposed approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">22.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The alternative is to require funds to be transferred out of an RSA once certain monetary levels are reached. However, this would be paternalistic, commercially intrusive and difficult to enforce. For example, people would, if they wished, be able to open a new RSA account before the limit was reached. Enforcing the use of Tax File Number linkages to ensure that people only operated one RSA could be effective, but would be cumbersome, expensive and intrusive on TFN policy. In addition, it would be inappropriate for members close to retirement, as RSA products could be used as part of a risk reduction strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tax File Number Reporting</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">23.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Proposed amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 will require superannuation funds to collect Tax File Number (TFN) particulars from members and will enable TFNs to be passed between funds on the transfer of members' benefits, and to the Commissioner of Taxation. To ensure RSA accumulated amounts can be readily transferred to and from superannuation funds, and that RSA account holders can be identified, TFN reporting provisions will also apply to RSAs on the same voluntary basis as for other transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Benefit Payment Rules/Preservation/Vesting</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">24.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Benefit payments would be subject to the same tax treatment and Reasonable Benefit Limits that apply to existing superannuation payments, including the related record keeping requirements.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Further, the same conditions of early release (such as in cases of financial hardship, or permanent departure overseas) would also apply. These rules are currently contained in the SIS Act and Income Tax legislation. Preservation and vesting rules for amounts paid into RSAs would be fully consistent with those which apply to other types of superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">25.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Deposit taking institutions which provided RSAs would be permitted to pay RSA benefits in the form of allocated pensions and lump sums only. The provision of ordinary pensions would be problematic as this would mean that banks, building societies and credit unions would be accepting mortality risk (for example, the risk of having to pay out a life pension greater than the value of the accumulated contribution and earnings, if say beneficiaries live longer than expected). Taking such risk is not readily compatible with the nature of a deposit taking institution. As RSAs will form part of the institution's deposits, any such risk would be borne by all depositors. (This issue is further discussed in paragraphs 8 and 9 of Attachment D under Constitutional issues.) RSAs offered by life offices would not face this restriction and could provide benefits in the form of an ordinary pension or annuity. This issue could be reviewed in the light of the findings of the Financial System Inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disclosure/Member Reporting Requirements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">26.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It will be necessary to put in place an appropriate information disclosure regime. This could be set out in legislation or in an ISC determination enabled by legislation. There is already a determination in place for public offer superannuation funds and approved deposit funds in certain circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">27.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Any departures from the standard superannuation disclosure regime would require very careful consideration. However, in view of the capital guaranteed nature of RSAs, it may be appropriate for RSAs to have less onerous marketing and prospectus requirements than other forms of superannuation. At a minimum, ongoing disclosure could cover contact information, annual account balance and amount deposited, annual and historic earnings/crediting rates, and fees and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">28.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> RSA providers would also have to give prospective depositors sufficient `point of sale' information to understand the main features and benefits of the RSA, including fees and charges, the low risk, low return nature of the product, and an indication that account holders have the right to request further information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Registering of RSA providers</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">29.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> RSA providers would not need to be licensed under the Corporations Law, as they are covered by alternative arrangements. This is provided there is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3092"> appropriate point of sale disclosure and the RSA is sold by the institution's employees and not by an agent on the institution's behalf. These issues will be dealt with in the disclosure regime to be put in place by the ISC. It would seem to be appropriate, however, for all RSA providers to meet at least the capital adequacy requirements applying to a public offer, complying superannuation fund, namely that the custodian of fund assets must have minimum net tangible assets of at least $5 million. Currently, some small building societies and credit unions may not meet these requirements. An authorisation process undertaken by the ISC would be necessary. This process would include an assessment that the institution's proposed systems and staff training will be adequate to ensure compliance with retirement income and other superannuation standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Member Protection Rules for Small Amounts</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">30.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> RSAs will be subject to the `member protection' rules in the SIS legislation, for amounts less than $1000. For such amounts, fees and charges are not normally permitted to exceed interest credits to the account (the main exception is life insurance premiums). RSAs should provide investors with the same protection in this regard as public offer superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Portability/Choice of Fund</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">31.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> RSAs should be required to be fully portable (subject to any fixed term for interest payments on the deposit account). That is, an RSA provider should be required to transfer part or whole of an account balance to another RSA or superannuation fund at the account&hyphen;holder's request. Such money should remain subject to preservation rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">32.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> An issue which will require further consideration, in the context of a review of portability more generally, is whether there should be any restrictions on exit fees or on up front fees/commissions that RSA providers can levy in the event of such transfers. In general, fees should only reflect legitimate administrative and investment costs and should be disclosed when the account is established.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">33.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Employees should be free to move from an RSA to another approved account of their choice, without leaving their existing employer, although choice of fund for new contributions will need to be exercised together with the employer where Superannuation Guarantee contributions or other employer contributions are to be made into that superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Complaints Handling</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">34.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is desirable to have a uniform approach to complaints handling for RSAs. In addition, the mechanisms for dealing with complaints about RSAs should be efficient and easily understood by all parties. The present diversity of dispute resolution schemes covering proposed RSA providers
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> makes this problematic, and in the case of building societies, the scheme is only in the early stage of development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">35.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The preferred option will be for all superannuation products to be subject to the existing ISC complaint processes for public offer superannuation funds. This would bring them under the jurisdiction of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal (SCT). However, the SCT already faces substantial work load pressures. This issue may need to be addressed should extending coverage to RSAs increase the SCT's workload significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Responsible Entity and Penalties</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">36.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A key feature of the SIS regime is that every regulated superannuation fund must have a `responsible' entity&mdash;that is a trustee&mdash;who is primarily responsible for the viability and prudent operation of the fund. The `responsible entity' concept ensures that trustees are fully accountable for any discretionary benefit payments made by the fund (eg. death and disability benefits) and are clearly liable for any gross negligence or international or reckless non&hyphen;compliance with the SIS standards. This framework of accountability is enhanced by the requirement for equal numbers of employer and employee representatives on the trustee boards of employer&hyphen;sponsored funds and for ISC approval of trustees of public offer superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">37.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To the extent that RSAs provide ancillary benefits to members, there will need to be both a responsible entity to make decisions about whether to pay such benefits in particular instances; and some entity with the financial institution will need to rake responsibility for ensuring that the SIS retirement income standards are complied with more generally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">38.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One possibility would be to make the Board of Directors of the institution responsible for these matters (they in turn could delegate decision&hyphen;making authority but not responsibility down the line). To enhance this process, the Board could be required to establish a `compliance committee' which would be accountable for compliance with RSA legislative provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">39.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Legislation would provide for the enforcement of penalties through the courts against the Board where an RSA provider breached the operating standards. Attorney&hyphen;General's Department advice is that the Commonwealth, under the Corporations power of the Constitution, could impose a regulatory regime for the provision of RSAs that involved the imposition of direct penalties on the responsible entity' of institutions offering RSAs for breaches of its regulatory requirements. Compliance with the regulatory regime by State banks (if any) offering RSAs could be negotiated voluntarily with the States or promoted through the tax system (al
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3093"> though any withdrawal of taxation concessions, as may be necessary because of breaches of superannuation legislation, would impact on RSA account holders, rather than the institution).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">40.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Given the public offer nature of RSAs there would be no requirement for equal representation on the `responsible entity' of the RSA provider. New entrants would be required to register with the ISC, and market players required to report annually, inter alia, the names of the relevant directors and to certify compliance with the SIS retirement income standards (including that a compliance and financial audit) had been undertaken by an approved external auditor.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Objectives</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The inclusion of RSAs on the balance sheet of a financial institution will have an impact on the taxation treatment that is provided for RSAs. It suggests that a financial institution would not be required to establish a separate entity to operate RSAs but could operate RSAs as part of its `general' business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are several objectives for the design of the taxation treatment of RSAs:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) That superannuation contributions made to an RSA, investment income credited to RSAs, and withdrawals from RSAs are taxed, as far as possible, interest he same manner as comparable superannuation transactions with a superannuation fund.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) That RSAs offered by different financial institutions are taxed, as far as possible, in a consistent manner; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) That the tax measures for RSAs should not confer any tax or commercial advantages to financial institutions which operate RSAs, compared to entities conducting traditional superannuation business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> However, the taxation treatment of RSAs needs to be incorporated into the taxation treatment
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> applying to each type of financial institution. As explained below, this places some restrictions on the degree of consistency that can be achieved in the taxation treatment of RSAs operated by different financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Possible Tax Design</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The taxation of RSAs within any financial institution using a balance sheet approach involves two steps.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Step One</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first step is to calculate the taxable income of the financial institution as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Assessable income, which would include all earnings generated from RSA funds, including any fees derived from RSA account holders, less:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Allowable deductions, which would include all amounts actually credited (as opposed to amounts accrued at a particular date) to each individual's RSA account during the financial year and any expenses incurred by the financial institution in undertaking RSA business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will generate a similar taxable income for RSA business to that arising for a deposit taking financial institution on ordinary deposit business. This will ensure that the financial institution is assessed at its relevant rate on its profit margin from operating RSA deposits, but not on the investment earnings credited to RSAs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> However, the rate of tax that will apply to the taxable income from RSA business will vary as it is governed by the `normal' tax rate applying to the type of financial institutions offering the account. The tax rates are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) for a bank, building society and non&hyphen;mutual life office&mdash;the company tax rate (36 per cent);</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) for a large credit union&mdash;20 per cent in 1996&hyphen;97 and 36 per cent thereafter (reflecting the legislated phase up of the taxation rates applicable to large credit unions);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) A large credit union is one defined in the tax legislation to generate notional taxable income higher than $150,000 per annum;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) More generous taxation rates apply to medium and small credit unions (though such credit unions may not qualify to register for RSA business if they do not satisfy the capital adequacy requirements proposed in Attachment B);</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) for a mutual life office 0 39 per cent; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) for a complying superannuation fund&mdash;15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Step Two</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The second step is to tax the RSA in the same manner as a superannuation fund, ie at 15 per cent on contributions and investment income (net of expenses). For practical reasons, this taxation would
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3094"> need to be withheld by the financial institution on behalf of the individual account holder. That is, the financial institution would credit a periodic payment (net of expenses) to the RSA account but withhold 15 per cent tax, which it would remit to the Australian Taxation Office. It would also remit 15 per cent tax from `deductible contributions' made to RSAs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This approach assumes that the financial institution would credit RSA accounts with returns net of expenses. However, it would be possible for the financial institution to credit gross returns and debit the RSA account with fees to cover expenses. In this case the fees would be deductible in determining the tax liability of the RSA account holder in step two, and the fees must be reflected in the assessable income of the financial institution in step one.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Assessment of the Tax Design</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A balance sheet approach is a relatively simple method of calculating the tax on RSA business. In relation to the tax liability described above in step one:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) for a bank, building society, credit union or complying superannuation funds, the calculation would be part of the normal calculation of taxable income for the financial institution;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) for a life insurance company, the calculation would be part of the calculation of the taxable income arising on the ordinary life insurance business in the case of a mutual and the non&hyphen;statutory fund component in the case of a non&hyphen;mutual.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the tax to be withheld by each financial institution under step two on behalf of RSA account holders, an additional, but relatively simple, calculation would be required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> However, the proposed tax treatment for RSAs assumes that all the expenses incurred in relation to the RSA business are incurred by the financial institution, and matched against its assessable income. This approach affects the taxation rate that will be applicable to the deduction and will result in each type of financial institution attracting deductions at their appropriate tax rate (as set out in paragraph 6)., rather than the 15 per cent complying superannuation fund tax rate.</PARA>
<PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The proposed taxation design raises a broader concern that inefficiencies will arise from the applicant of different taxation rates and other taxation arrangements to the RSA business of different types of financial institutions. However, the proposed taxation treatment for RSAs is merely extending the taxation arrangements that presently apply to various parts of the financial industry. For instance, for tax purposes, banks currently return interest on an accruals basis whereas life offices and superannuation funds return interest on a cash basis. Other policy work is currently being undertaken address such distortions in the tax treatment of the financial sector. A review of the tax treatment of financial arrangements generally is well progressed and other reviews on the tax treatment of leasing transactions and life insurance are being undertaken. For example, a desirable outcome of the current review of the taxation of life insurance would be that the trustee rate be aligned with the company tax rate. This would reduce differences in the tax rates applying to RSA business conducted by different types of financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Under the proposed arrangement there would appear to be little opportunity for the financial institution to manipulate the calculation of taxable income to gain a taxation advantage from the lower tax rate applying under step two. This is because the financial institution would claim all deductions at its relevant tax rate and thus gain no additional advantage from `shifting' expenses to the RSA business. As the concessional tax rate of 15 per cent will only apply to amounts credited by the financial institution to individual RSA accounts (amounts which are able to be audited), there would appear to be little scope for the financial institution to gain a taxation advantage for itself.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This attachment outlines several constitutional issues which may arise in the implementation of RSAs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Direct Penalties and State Banking</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> First, there is the question of whether the Commonwealth Parliament can legislate to provide for the imposition of direct penalties on State `responsible entitles'&mdash;that is, State banks, building societies and credit unions&mdash;where the RSAs provided by those institutions breached the standards contained within SIS or equivalent legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Attorney&hyphen;General's Department advice is that direct penalties could be imposed on banks (other than State banks), building societies and credit unions. The Parliament cannot impose restrictions directly on State banks in relation to the operation of RSAs. This is because the Commonwealth cannot make laws in relation to `State banking'. `State banking' is the business of banking conducted by a bank owned or controlled by a State. Under section 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution, a State may refer its banking power, in relation to a State bank,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the Commonwealth, as has been done several times to date. QIDC is the only State bank currently operating in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Constitutional Interpretation of `Banking'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">  Second, Attorney&hyphen;General's Department has advised that on the basis of ordinary principles of Constitutional interpretation, the High Court would be likely to give a broad meaning to the Constitutional concepts of `banking'. It therefore seems possible that the provision of an RSA could constitute `banking' in the Constitutional sense, at least to the extent that it involved taking money on deposit and repaying a like sum (or an amount or amounts bearing some predetermined mathematical relationship to that sum) to the depositor or his or her personal representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Thus, institutions other than banks which provide RSAs could be in breach of the Banking Act 1959 unless an exemption were given under section 11 of that Act to allow such institutions to carry on any banking business in Australia (but not the general business of banking). Building societies and credit unions are already provided with a general section 11 exemption by virtue of being registered under the Financial Corporations Act 1974. However, life offices and superannuation funds which want to provide RSAs may need to obtain a section 11 exemption. This can be given by the Treasurer, by order published in the Gazette, can apply to a specific group and may be made subject to any necessary conditions which are specified in the exemption order.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Constitutional Interpretation of `Insurance'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Third, Attorney&hyphen;General's Department has advised that on the basis of ordinary principles of Constitutional interpretation, the High Court would be likely to give a broad meaning to the Constitutional concepts of `insurance'. It therefore seems possible that the provisions of an RSA could
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3096"> constitute `insurance' in the Constitutional sense to the extent that it involved the acceptance of risk by a financial institution. This issue can be resolved by ensuring that banks, building societies and credit unions only pay out allocated pensions (e.g. where there is no risk of having to pay a pension to a  client greater than the value of the accumulated contributions and earnings).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Therefore, in line with existing restrictions on the type of liability commitments that institutions may incur, it is proposed that RSAs offered by deposit taking institutions be limited to products that do not involve incurring any mortality risk or risks associated with defined benefits in their payouts. Such RSAs will be accumulation accounts (benefits will broadly be the accumulation of contributions plus net earnings on those contributions) and will pay out benefits in a form that does not involve mortality risk, namely as lump sums or allocated pensions. In addition, as an RSA is an individual account, even a life office could not provide risk cover on it. Such cover would need to be purchased separately from a life office using member contributions.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Required Legislative Amendments</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allowing institutions to offer RSAs will require a separate Bill amending the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and any other affected tax legislation.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Department of Finance</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finance supports the proposal to allow certain financial intermediaries to offer Retirement Savings Accounts (RSAs) as a means of increasing competition and choice for consumers in the area of superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RSAs provide an alternative to the Superannuation Holding Accounts Reserve (SHAR) administered by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) in which small amounts are accumulated, without the value being eroded by fees and charges. RSAs should thus replace the need to continue this arrangement and it would be appropriate to review the ongoing necessity for SHAR and associated administrative costs in ATO prior to the 1998&hyphen;99 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unlike savings invested in normal superannuation funds, savings in RSAs will be subject to State taxes such as financial institutions duty tax. This may present a revenue windfall to States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We note that the National Commission of Audit considers existing superannuation arrangements as unnecessarily complex and in need of simplification, and recommends the Government should undertake a comprehensive review of options for improving the contributions of household saving to national saving, including in the area of superannuation.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Impact on age and service pension outlays</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The submission notes at paragraph 18 that `RSAs are expected to be a relatively low return form of superannuation savings, . . . not generally suitable vehicles for accumulating superannuation savings over a whole lifetime'. The effectiveness of the proposed $10,000 `voluntary' cap might be reviewed at a later date to ensure that Government targets for the future containment of age and service pension outlays are not compromised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Competitive neutrality
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3097"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DSS notes that the proposal, if implemented, would increase competition within the superannuation market, but differentiate between competitors in some respects. Complying superannuation funds would operate RSA `equivalents' under the trustee structure, which, it is argued, imposes higher  administration costs than other business structures. Complying superannuation funds would be subject to limitations on the assets in which they could invest, reducing the returns they might otherwise achieve for investors. Different types of institutions would be subject to different rates of tax on their taxable income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impact of such differentiation, to the extent that it exists after the Financial System Inquiry and the current review of the tax treatment of financial arrangements, should be reviewed in the light of experience with the operation of RSAs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RSAs opened by employers</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DSS notes employers' legitimate concerns about being required to deal with many financial institutions if RSAs are introduced. However, permitting employers to open RSAs on behalf of employees may limit consumer choice and, for transient workers, result in multiple small accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many employers already pay salary and wages into accounts nominated by employees and it should be quite feasible for these employers to make superannuation contribution payments in the same way.

In fact, nobody at that time asked during the inquiry stage for this provision to be incorporated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to quote from correspondence from the Australian Consumers' Association which outlines the reasons why it does not believe it is necessary to set up a trustee&hyphen;type system. The letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, ACA does not believe it is necessary to establish a trustee type system for RSA providers . . . as long as certain other safeguards are met. RSAs are intended to be simple super products that could be offered by prudentially supervised deposit taking institutions, and should not require the additional cost of trustee type arrangements if other consumer protections are in place. We fear that such a move would see Credit Unions and Building Societies, in particular, shut out of the RSA market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mechanisms that provide real choice for consumers, including a proper information disclosure regime, will provide the key safeguards for consumers. In addition, due diligence defences against misleading and deceptive conduct are inappropriate for such products and should not be in the Bill. The removal of such defences will help to establish the protection that a trustee structure may otherwise provide.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, this evening we agreed to remove those due diligence clauses from the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do need to acknowledge that this is a different product.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unnecessary because it overlooks stringent prudential safeguards which RSA providers are subject to in the place of a trust structure.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe therefore that what has been proposed by Senator Harradine is not necessary and, as expressed by Senator Allison, many groups in the community, even those with a consumer orientation, apparently do not find it required either and presumably they are looking closely at the very tight prudential supervision which RSA providers are under. I also mention, Senator Harradine, that the banks of course have expressed a strong view on this issue, as I understand the credit unions have also done. In my view, people who have concerns about bills are entitled to come and see senators to put their views. We do not have to accept their views, but they are entitled to make them known. We are well aware of the sorts of concerns that have been expressed but, as I said, we all believe in safeguards. Safeguards for retirement savings are particularly important. We

If the government's response before Senate estimates on superannuation issues is any guide to go by, it will be a non&hyphen;event largely.

<PARA STYLE="Para">I hope this amendment will be supported by the committee, despite what has been said on the previous amendment that I moved. This amendment seeks to amend the Life Insurance Act 1995 in a number of aspects but the key to it is the insertion of a new clause. The object of the amendment is, as the proposed new 1B of the Life Insurance Act indicates:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The duty and liability of a director is the same as the duty and liability that would exist if:</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the directors were trustees of the assets of the statutory fund under a trust for the execution of the provisions of this Part in respect of those assets; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the owners of policies referable to the fund were beneficiaries under that trust.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is slightly different to the amendment that I moved previously. This really brings it down to the question of whether we are going to have a level playing field, whether in fact RSAs, which are offered by banks, are going to provide the protection necessary to beneficiaries of amounts of money put aside for employees for superannuation purposes, which of course they need for their old age, for their being disabled or for their widows and orphans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If these obligations are imposed upon superannuation funds, I think it is fair enough that they be imposed upon other providers in the superannuation regime. I explain to the committee that, where my amendment relates to schedule 12, under 1A I am seeking to have subsection 34(5) of the Life Insurance Act 1995 repealed. That subsection says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to avoid doubt, it is declared that nothing in this Act is intended to constitute a life company or the directors of a life company a trustee or trustees of the assets of the statutory funds of the company.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What I am proposing is really not necessarily that they be constituted in a formal structural manner but that the duties and liabilities of the directors be the same as the duties and liabilities that would exist if the directors were in fact trustees of the assets of the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> statutory fund under a trust for the execution of the provision of that part of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That deals with the addition of 1A, 1B and 1C. In so far as 1D is concerned, I am seeking to have a provision inserted in subsection 48(4) of Life Insurance Act which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The owner of a policy referable to the fund has the same right to institute proceedings against a director in respect of a breach of the duty imposed by this section as the policy owner would have as a beneficiary under the trust referred to in paragraph (3A)(a).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As honourable senators will know, section 48 of the Life Insurance Act 1995 refers to the duties of directors in relation to statutory funds. Section 48 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) A director of a life company has a duty to the owners of policies referable to a statutory fund of the company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The director's duty is a duty to take reasonable care, and use due diligence, to see that, in the investment, administration and management of the assets of the fund, the life company:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) complies with this Part; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) gives priority to the interests of owners and prospective owners of policies referable to the fund.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The key point we are talking about here is to give the utmost protection that is reasonable&mdash;I do not know whether it is possible&mdash;to the beneficiaries of the RSAs. Without canvassing all the arguments that have been trawled around this place previously on as late as 25 March this year and today, I would like to commend the amendments to the committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Labor Party will be supporting the amendment that Senator Harradine has moved. It deals with the same sort of principle that we addressed in the previous bill. Again, broadly we support the approach and principle of Senator Harradine. As we have said time and time again in this debate, superannuation moneys are for retirement. They are a special form of savings. They should be subject to an enhanced protective mechanism. This, in part, goes to enhancing that protection mechanism. In the interests of consistency we support those. One question

As they are required to put them into something, it does seem a bit odd that one of those choices does not have the same protection as the other. Therefore we will be supporting this. It does not seem right to put corporate profit above other considerations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and less secure. It does not seem to be the normal way with investments. Usually there is a trade-off between security and returns. This is a very odd situation. That is why I really do think it would be necessary for the Senate to look into the performance of these retirement savings account some time on. I agree with Senator Sherry that perhaps a Senate inquiry should look into this. I am sure we will be looking into the operations of the superannuation
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> surcharge/tax. However, I think we will certainly find it necessary to look at these in a year's time and hope the government has enough nous to realise that, if the legislation is not working and not protecting workers, it will be prepared at that stage to change it or repeal it.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think, as Senator Sherry said, this is essentially to reinstate the similar principle that was moved in a previous amendment by Senator Harradine. Without canvassing all the arguments put then and the previous time this amendment came before the chamber, the coalition will be opposing this amendment. I think the distinction though, Senator Sherry, is that this amendment in fact goes far wider than superannuation. Whereas the previous amendment dealt with RSAs and superannuation&hyphen;like products, this in fact goes far wider than the superannuation product. So Senator Harradine is attempting to reinsert a provision which was deleted from the Life Insurance Act 1945.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Life Insurance Act 1945, introduced by the previous government&mdash;now they are apparently not supporting it&mdash;has inserted in it new provisions which require directors of life insurance companies to give priority to the interests of policy owners over the interests of shareholders. That is what the act requires. This is akin to fiduciary obligations but recognises the non&hyphen;trust nature of life policies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make only some brief comments in opposing the third reading of the bills. My colleague Senator Lundy will be making some further comments. We traversed over our in&hyphen;principle concern with the concept of RSAs on the occasion when this package of legislation was debated prior to Easter. The Labor Party on that occasion, the Democrats on some occasions, I think the Greens and Senator Harradine, moved a range of amendments&mdash;a few of which were carried&mdash;and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ultimately the legislation that we had before us tonight was defeated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with some irony that amendments that were passed on that occasion were not passed on this occasion and  amendments that were not passed on the last occasion were passed on this occasion. It is an intriguing little set of contradictions that we have had with respect to the amendments to the RSA bills that passed or failed when we considered them six weeks ago and again today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the central concerns for Labor has been the protection of workers' retirement money. It is money that is contributed compulsorily. In a number of elements, the deal between the Democrats and the government fails the principles we enunciated six weeks ago. I do not intend on this occasion to go through those principles again. We have done so time and time again in respect of our consideration of this legislation and, I certainly believe, we have clearly demonstrated that the principles we adhere to in respect of superannuation have not been met by the final package of legislation that has been presented to the Senate today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First and foremost, Labor has been consistent in its call for the RSA product to be prudentially regulated in a similar manner to traditional superannuation products, recognising of course that banks have a company structure. Credit unions and building societies have a somewhat different structure, but the same principles apply to superannuation currently offered, which is protected by what is regarded as a world leader of prudential regulation; that is, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not have one of the great safeguards of superannuation products in respect of RSAs&mdash;trustees. We accept that that would not have been a realistic proposition, but adopting the common law trustee duty, as well as the statute law as exemplified by the SI(S) Act, certainly would have provided one of the essential safeguards we sought. We do not believe that in practice the types of protections, the so-called choice options, that have been agreed between the Democrats and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3104"> the government will offer sufficient protection to Australian workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude my remarks by quoting from a Mr Tom Ross, chairman of the United Kingdom National Association of Pension Funds. In reference to products similar to RSAs he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And I think that it's the best illustration I have come across, in the financial world at any rate, that giving people freedom, flexibility and the ability to exercise choice without suitable education and without adequate regulation of those who are purveying the choices is a recipe for disaster.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I hope, colleagues, that the recipe for disaster we see in the superannuation policies of this government does not come to pass. If it is not disaster, it will certainly be a series of legislation, including retirement savings accounts, that will not enhance the retirement income of Australian workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the set of measures we considered earlier in respect of the now&hyphen;named tax and at the deeming of superannuation when a person turns 55, the interesting test of these three sets of legislation is: do they provide one dollar extra into Australian workers' superannuation? The answer is very simple. They do not. No-one is better off as a consequence of these three fundamental changes to superannuation legislation in this country. The retirement savings account is but the third very important measure which is detrimental. Not one Australian is one dollar better off as a consequence of these superannuation changes.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to oppose the third reading of this series of legislation. In doing so, I also want to make a few comments about its failings in the eyes of the workers who are the ones who stand to lose if this legislation is in fact passed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of issues have been raised by my colleague Senator Sherry. I will touch upon them also. In doing so, I want to basically declare what interest I have in superannuation. It is a personal one that comes about from having been a member of an industry superannuation scheme, from about a month after I
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> started work in the building industry when I was 16.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that time, the furthest thing from my mind was superannuation or my retirement savings, as I am sure you can all appreciate. My introduction to that superannuation scheme did make me think, as a young person, how important it was not just to try and earn some money at the time but to think about all of these things. At the time in the building industry, it was quite controversial, I suppose, because we were basically looking at wage sacrifice to allow contributions to be made to that industry superannuation scheme. C&hyphen;BUS, as it is now known, has gone on to become one of the largest industry superannuation schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another interest is that my partner is a trustee on that board. I mention that because, from that perspective, I know exactly what the trustee's role is in industry superannuation and how important the amendment put forward by Labor, and a similar one put forward by Senator Harradine, is to ensuring that these fiduciary responsibilities of the directors of these RSAs are overridden by the same requirements as are provided by trustees for the members of superannuation funds. Both those amendments have failed and, in their failure, have left the interests of workers at the mercy of the banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there are not too many people out there that would actually feel some comfort in the banks having complete control over their money in this regard. We only need to look at what has happened with fees and charges in an unregulated environment to see whose interests the banks represent. There is now no adequate protection of members' money. The opportunity was there for the government to do that in a variety of ways, including our amendments placing restrictions on fees and charges for the RSA product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not supporting that amendment was a gift to the banks&mdash;nothing more. It is another way in which they can produce more profits in the interests of their shareholders, not gains in the interests of members who take out these RSA accounts. It opens up a whole new area for the banks and allows them to move into a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3105"> market in which they had not previously operated, and it does so at the expense of industry funds. Industry funds, I have to say, offer more to members than just a simple superannuation product that provides a reasonable return to members. They offer a lot more in the sense that their investment policies are certainly generally geared towards the interests of members, but they are also geared towards the interests of the industry from which they seek their membership and cover in terms of membership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry funds also look towards the needs of their members. In a large number of cases they offer supplementary benefits for membership, including death cover, disability insurance and so forth. As is the nature of the building industry, which is the example I am using, because employment is so transient and members and workers in this industry can expect some periods of unemployment, these benefits carry on if employer contributions cease for a short period of time. So the insurance provided by these schemes extends beyond the actual point at which an employment contract exists. These benefits came about not because the super funds came up with a good idea, but because they responded to the needs of members. How are RSAs going to do that? They are not structured on an industry basis. They are not structured in a way that is responsive to the needs of their members. They are structured in a way that is wholly and solely controlled by the boards in the interests of the shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the issue of choice&mdash;a pet subject of this government. It is a subject on which we hear lots of rhetoric, but we are yet to hear any substance. We have heard Minister Kemp talk about choice, both now and the previous time this legislation was debated, but here we have no choice. How can you say there is choice in a member or a worker opting for a RSA when, if no clarification is sought by the member, the default position is payment of their contribution into an RSA and not into a superannuation fund or an industry fund? That is not choice. It is about giving the banks a gift. It is about exploiting the perhaps complacency of some members who feel quite secure in their indus
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> try fund and are confident that their retirement savings are building up with an adequate interest rate and with their interests at heart. It is exploiting that complacency&mdash;complacency that has been built up with good reason because of the success of some of the major industry funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from RSAs denying workers real choice in their superannuation fund in that regard, they also leave casual workers, part&hyphen;time workers and lower income workers at a disadvantage. When you have transient employment, another bout of paperwork is quite often the furthest thing from your mind. When you transfer from one job to another it is hard enough forwarding your address and your details and changing your accounts and all the rest that comes with changing jobs. It is ironic that this government talks about cutting red tape for small business in this regard. We have had an increase in red tape for the workers, the consumers, who have to concern themselves with changing jobs and changing super. That applies not just to the application of an industry fund, if that is what they pursue, but also to managing what could perhaps become a multitude of RSAs under different employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue with respect to this choice is that the workers that I have just mentioned are quite often women. It is quite often women who have the part&hyphen;time jobs, the casual jobs and the lower paid jobs. It is quite often the case that women may not have preoccupied themselves with issues relating to superannuation because of the nature of their employment. In recent times women have started to take an interest in this. Statistically, you do not need to look too far back to see how successful Labor's policies were in getting women involved in superannuation and interested in their own retirement incomes. RSAs undermine this progress. They undermine it in a way that will for ever, from here on in, once again put these people at a disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last thing I would like to say on this issue is what it does to superannuation and the confidence that people generally have in superannuation. I mentioned this matter when the previous superannuation legislation&mdash;the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3106"> surcharge bill, now the tax bill&mdash;was debated. The tax bill went a long way toward undermining the confidence of the community in the superannuation product. This RSA legislation takes that one step further. Not only can you not have confidence that your savings will be intact if your income is over the $70,000 level, but also, just to make sure the other end of the stick is disadvantaged, you can have an RSA account as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everything that this government has done has undermined the role of superannuation as a viable retirement savings option. It is unfair. It is not about choice. It is about a gift to the banks. I for one do not believe it is the banks that need assistance at this point in time; it is working people who need to have a bit of faith and a bit of confidence in the superannuation product. Unfortunately, they will not be satisfied when this legislation goes through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nothing has been resolved in the deal the Democrats have done with the government.  The issues of concern have not been answered, they have not been addressed. The crucial amendments have not been supported. That is why we on the Labor side find ourselves opposing this third reading. As I have said, we oppose it for very good reasons.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the committee does not insist upon its amendments disagreed to by the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There have been two High Court actions, seven Federal Court actions, three Supreme Court actions, a royal commission, two inquiries under federal Aboriginal heritage protection legislation, a state inquiry and an investigation by the Environment, Resources and Development Committee of state parliament. Enough is enough. The time has come for the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair to be brought to an end once and for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill has now been before the parliament since October last year&mdash;almost eight months. Since then, the bill has been debated extensively first in the House of Representatives, then in the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee, then not once but twice in the Senate itself and then once more in the House of Repre sentatives. No-one could say that the issues have not been comprehensively examined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, Labor has always said that the bridge should go ahead but, perversely, it had until recently refused to support the bill. Even when Mr Beazley said that Labor would support the bill even if the government rejected its amendment, the bill was still not passed. So senators will understand the government's considerable frustration at the fact that we are here today yet again debating the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To say the least, there is no need for further extended debate on the matter. All the facts and all the arguments are well known; there is nothing new to add. Legal action has been commenced to force me to appoint another section 10 report. This action is very likely to succeed if it continues. That would result in the preparation of a fifth report. I do not know what that will cost. The Justice Mathews report cost a  million dollars of taxpayers' money. There has been an estimate that another report could cost at least $200,000, and there would be no guarantee
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that it would lead to a finalisation of the matter, given the history of litigation surrounding the affair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the legal actions have been discontinued pending the passage of the bill. My understanding is that the action will recommence if the bill is not passed now. We are presented with one final window of opportunity to apply some commonsense to all of this. It is time to pass the bill without delay. I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME><STATE> (Northern Territory)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.02 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The one thing on which I agree with the minister is that I also see no need to prolong the debate here tonight, and I will not do so. Frankly, considering the history of this matter, I would be surprised if any senator was of another view. It is perfectly true that the issue has been comprehensively canvassed in the Senate. What is also true is that right up until this point in time the minister has not provided a cogent reason&mdash;or any cogent reasons at all&mdash;as to why the powers that are available to him have not been exercised rather than taking this route.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the reason for that has just been given in the minister's use of the word `perverse' in respect of the opposition's position on this piece of legislation. The minister said that the opposition stated clearly and publicly that we had no objection to the bridge itself being built and yet perversely would not support this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That simply indicates that the minister has absolutely no conception of why the opposition and other senators oppose this bill. The reason is that it suspends the operation of a federal piece of legislation designed to protect the places of significance to Aboriginal people for the purpose of this particular construction. It is the first time&mdash;and I hope the only time&mdash;that it has been done. The bill provides for that expressly. In fact, the only really relevant clause of the bill simply removes this particular proposal from the ambit of that act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As speaker after speaker after speaker in this debate has pointed out, there is not only clear understanding from reading the legislation itself but also a number of substantive
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3109"> legal decisions that make it absolutely clear that there is no way that the minister can be forced to make a declaration under this act if the minister determines that he will not do so. Indeed, some of those decisions are quite recent ones. That has never been contested by any court. Indeed, it has been confirmed by the highest legal authority in this country that the minister cannot be forced to make that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I make that point is that the operative clause of this bill says that the heritage protection act does not authorise the making of a declaration in relation to the preservation or protection of an area or object from any of the following activities&mdash;that is, the construction of the bridge. The minister, if he is so minded, cannot be compelled to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I can go back to the genesis of this act because I was involved in the events that led to that act being introduced by the then minister for Aboriginal affairs, Clyde Holding. The very first application made under that act to the acting minister for Aboriginal affairs at that time, Susan Ryan,  was rejected by the minister. You could hardly get a clearer case to support what I am saying. It was related to the construction of a dam in Western Australia where a sacred site had been damaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it was seriously contested by anyone that the site was damaged. A report was commissioned into the matter which confirmed that. The report was given to the minister that a site had been desecrated. Acting minister Ryan, as she then was, came down with a determination, despite that report, that in the public interest because of the importance of the dam to the local community no declaration for protection would be issued and that the construction of the dam could proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the first cab off the rank. The reason for that is very important. The reason was that it was deliberately drafted by the government of the day to provide a degree of protection to sacred sites in Australia at the federal level because of the paucity of such protective legislation at the state level. Again, those who want to have reference to the act
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will see that deliberately referred to. If the minister is satisfied that state legislation provides sufficient protection, that is sufficient for the minister not to make a declaration under this act. The minister was always given&mdash;and deliberately given&mdash;by the drafters of the act a determining position in respect of protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not intend to launch into that explanation once again, but it was the minister's use of the word `perverse' that required me to do so. It is not a perverse position, Minister. I am sorry you cannot understand that there is no contradiction between saying that we have no objection to the bridge going ahead&mdash;and I understand that others do, but that is not our position&mdash;and at the same time saying that we find this avenue to get it built highly objectionable. We have pressed our case hard in here. We have placed our objections to this on the public record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister made an interesting statement a few moments ago. He said, in respect of the report, that legal action has been taken to compel him to initiate&mdash;if he had done so, I might add, it would be finished by now&mdash;and he said, `I don't know what it would cost.' As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record will clearly indicate, he had no difficulty some time ago in throwing around figures of $1 million with gay abandon. A million dollars is not a problem. That was put again and again in here by the minister&mdash;six months, 12 months, $1 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the minister knows, when this matter was pursued at Senate estimates&mdash;and I was pursuing it, so I know without reference to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that this, in fact, was the answer given&mdash;the officers of ATSIC, who would have been responsible for commissioning the report and paying for it, said that their best estimate based on their experience with these things was that it could have been done in two months at the cost of around $100,000. So I am interested to hear that the minister says tonight that he did not know what it would cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The relevant matter&mdash;and the minister has touched on it, and I agree with him&mdash;is that that legal action would almost certainly have forced the report to be commissioned by the minister. That much of administrative case
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3110"> law I am familiar with. He could not have unreasonably delayed for much longer, I would not have thought, actually commissioning the report. The report would, I suspect, have been completed within that two months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report probably would not have cost, in my view, much more than $100,000. I think that figure is about right. Inevitably, as I have said already, at the end of that process it would have been totally open to the minister to have declined to make a declaration for protection under the act. In fact, there is no question at all, in terms of what is already on the public record, that that is precisely what he would have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is for those reasons that the opposition does not intend tonight to press this matter further. There may well be a legal challenge. I think the absolute lowest point of this debate for me&mdash;particularly in the current climate, in the context of public debate in Australia on these issues at the moment&mdash;was when the government stated, not once but on several occasions, that they would have been quite confident about using the power given by one of the rare successful referenda in Australia to the federal government to make laws for the benefit of the Aboriginal people of Australia. They would have relied constitutionally for that power on the passage of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I mention that is that I do not think a High Court case in the history of the High Court has been misinterpreted deliberately by many people more than the recent decision in Wik. The High Court has been subject to the most extraordinary attacks by the most senior people in public life in Australia, including the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer).</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, the Premier of the state of Queensland; but relevant to this parliament, the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia was among those attacks. What concerned me profoundly as an Australian, who does have some concern about the institutions that our successful exercise in democracy has in this country, is
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that those attacks were based on utter nonsense and a total distortion, deliberate in some cases, of the actual decision taken by the High Court in Wik&mdash;clearly by people who had not bothered to read the judgments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Buried among this diatribe of abuse of the High Court for making allegedly loopy decisions and stupid decisions and decisions that make no sense about the devaluation of the land, Senator Ron Boswell, on the ABC recently, talked about how appallingly disadvantaged pastoralists in Australia had been since the Wik decision because of the devaluation of their land as a result of Wik.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but can I say, Senator, in respect of your interjection, `The Sultan of Brunei,' absentee Los Angeles dentists&mdash;who own another property that I am familiar with&mdash;or whoever have, in fact, not lost a dollar in terms of the value of their land from Wik, and I say that authoritatively as somebody who is very close to the workface on this issue. Wik has caused a number of concerns that have to be resolved for pastoralists. One of them is not the value of their land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that in respect of any decision taken from this action&mdash;and a lot of people are anticipating some High Court action in respect of this matter&mdash;I hope that whatever decision the High Court may take on this issue is, in fact, carefully considered by people rather than simply being thrown in as another convenient card to play in what is certainly the nastiest and the most divisive race debate that I have witnessed in my 20 years in public life in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever else you can say about the current debate, from my perspective, particularly from where I come from&mdash;and I have seen a few race debates: I have stood up at platforms at `Rights for Whites' meetings on more than one occasion over the years, and that is among a number of organisations that I can recall&mdash;I have not seen a more divisive debate at the moment. But if you are going to criticise the High Court, at least criticise it for what it has done, not for what it has not done.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3111">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, you may or may not have heard an interview&mdash;on Anzac Day, interestingly enough, the 25th of April&mdash;on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> with a representative of the Australian Institute of Valuers. This is the institute in Australia which actually advises lending institutions on the value of land. The transcript of the interview is instructive. To all those who are claiming that people's land has been devalued by the Wik decision and that we suddenly have to do things like upgrade the title of pastoral leases right across Australia overnight, that representative of the institute said that nothing of the sort had happened&mdash;that the Wik decision had simply confirmed what the institute and banking institutions had known forever, because banking institutions have never lent money on the basis of the value of leasehold land. In fact, the representative of this institute said&mdash;and I thought it was instructive&mdash;that banks and lending institutions, and indeed his institute, had always based their decisions on the value of land on the actual legal status of the title held by people rather than perceptions by the titleholders as to what they might and might not have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say in the context of this debate, Minister, that this ill-considered diatribe of abuse of the High Court decision in respect of Wik has been almost entirely erroneous and based on absolute nonsense rather than fact. I also know that, from talking to people at the front who are currently negotiating their loans from the banking institutions for the next financial year&mdash;and these are from people who do have problems in respect of Wik, particularly those who have multiple claims over their land&mdash;the banks have advised them that, as far as the banks are concerned, nothing has changed since Wik in respect of the value of that land, and the bank is placing exactly the same valuation on that land this year as it did last year. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are riding along, unfortunately, with that wave of scapegoatism, with that very wave that was alluded to by Senator Collins that comes along with the Wik decision, that very wave of scapegoatism that allows people to think that the taxpayers ought to, in the end, put their hands in their pockets and give large welfare payments to some of the richest people amongst the largest pastoralists in Australia.

In fact, Tom Chapman himself told the committee that nothing was legally stopping it. He said there were no legal impediments and that there had not been any impediments since July last year. Mr Palyga said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have been asking . . . repeatedly since the full court decision on 7 December . . . to start constructing the bridge.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was 7 December last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So legislation is not necessary, but what we have to understand about what the government is doing here is the context of it. It has come in with an agenda, which was whispered before the election but which Pauline Hanson has since shouted from the rafters, to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3113"> play on the prejudices of the Australian community. They did it. They coasted into government and that helped them. When they came into government, they wanted to continue with the agenda and I do not think it is an overexaggeration to say that they used indigenous Australians as a political football.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Herron was jumping out of his skin to appoint an auditor. He was jumping out of his skin to do other things and on every occasion he jumped out of his skin he was put back in it by the Federal Court. That has been the history of this particular minister in this particular portfolio since the election&mdash;voices whispering before the election now echoing and reverberating back to government members through the mouth of Pauline Hanson. This legislation was born in that climate and if the Prime Minister was serious about trying to tone down the debate and trying to take some divisiveness out of this community, he would be pulling this legislation because he knows and the minister knows that it is not necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Collins said earlier today, it would have taken a couple of months and less than $100,000 or thereabouts and they would have had their bridge built, because nothing could have forced the minister to take one  position or another and he himself has acknowledged that. If he had really wanted this bridge built, he would have taken that action a good few months ago and there would be no impediment now. But what he has chosen to do and what the Prime Minister has chosen to do is to play politics in a way that not only frustrates the timetable for those who want to build the bridge, but also may very well lay the groundwork for some real constitutional problems in the rest of their anti&hyphen;black agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that because this bridge could very well have been built&mdash;and everyone knows it&mdash;under existing legislation without one entry into this parliament. But by taking this particular course, Senator Herron, you have guaranteed that you will be back in the High Court within a week&mdash;w&hyphen;e&hyphen;e&hyphen;k. You will be back in the High Court within a very short period of time and you will be back in the High Court with issues that you yourself have
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> admitted that you did not even prepare yourself on. What is the basis of the constitutional power on which you act? We asked you that just a few weeks ago when you first brought in this legislation and you said, `I have got no problem. I haven't prepared. I haven't asked anyone about constitutional problems and power.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is precisely what you said. Have you taken advice on the constitutional foundation? You said, `No, and I don't need to.' Come in spinner, bowling full tosses! `We don't need special legislation.' Have you taken advice? `No.' You do not know that what you are doing has got some basic constitutional concerns whether it is the race power, or whether it is your playing around with special measures under the international covenant, or the RDA. Senator Herron, you have come into this parliament with this legislation without adequate preparation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say, as one of those who has taken an interest in this debate, knowing that the minute you became minister the chances of the Aboriginal women in terms of having any say in the process would be dashed, that you have actually played right into the hands of those who have a real concern that this bridge does not get built. You have played it and you have walked into it blindfolded and it has been of your own choosing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One good thing that will come out of this, Senator Herron, is that this will go to the High Court almost immediately and issues that are critical to the Wik debate will probably be assessed by the High Court&mdash;issues as to whether the race power can be used in a way detrimental to a particular race, particularly indigenous Australians; issues such as the duration of a special measure, and whether a special measure can be wound back in the absence of any substantive improvement of the race for which that measure was introduced. They are some of the issues&mdash;issues of course as to racial discrimination which I am sure will always come to the attention of the court when it deals with matters like the constitutional ones that I mentioned.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3114">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time as this, Senator Herron, you have before you a decision in respect of Boobera Lagoon, a decision for which there is a report recommending against the desecration of the area and about which you have refused to take any action.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`It's going well', he says. Well I heard you on radio 10 days ago saying that you were going to make a decision last week. I said to myself, `That is probably because he thinks Hindmarsh Island will be through next week. He will wait until Hindmarsh Island is through and then he can address Boobera Lagoon and not take the action recommended in the report.' I will bet you London to a brick that is what you are going to do. Once this is through, you will make it very clear that you had absolutely no compulsion on you to act in respect of Boobera Lagoon, but you might do one or two things to try and placate people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Herron, you know that nothing can force you, but all of us know that you have led with your chin in respect of this legislation. Under existing legislation, the bridge could have been commenced by now. Under your legislation, it will be back in the High Court within just a few days, if not a few hours, and a bridge that could have been built  by the end of last year or early this year will not be built until those High Court proceedings are over. You are, in fact, ensuring that construction of the bridge is delayed. Not only will you be held to account for that degree of gross negligence in not preparing yourself on constitutional grounds, but also I am sure the Chapmans will remember you for it. In respect of the Chapmans, let me say to them that, in urging for this legislation, I think they have actually dug themselves into a corner as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go back to the point that this is actually one of the most sleazy and sordid bits of legislation this parliament has seen because there is no justification for it other than for the politics of race and prejudice. That is what has driven this, that is what drives it and that is what continues to drive this minister, who knows no better, and this Prime Minister, who wants no better. I actually think that this
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is one of the sorrier days in our parliamentary history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must admit that, for my part, I only support this legislation because it will finish up in the High Court and those issues that we are so keen to ensure are clarified will be clarified in a way that could probably pre&hyphen;empt some of the planks of your 10&hyphen;point plan in response to Wik.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the problem with this legislation includes what has already been mentioned in terms of the indigenous people, but I want to mention the problem for the Australian constitutional system generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this case, there is an expectation that without this legislation there may have been a challenge over the bridge; that this legislation has anticipated, if you like, judicial proceedings and has stepped in. This is not the first time that has happened. There have been other examples of where people with a right of action at law have had their case interdicted by legislation. And that is a very bad thing. So it is not simply the indigenous people who are at risk here; it is anybody who wants to bring an action and particularly an action against the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing I want to say is this: the Racial Discrimination Act is often mentioned here and it is usually mentioned in terms of what protection it gives to the Aboriginal people. But the Racial Discrimination Act is an act with general application for all Australians and, in a multicultural society or however you want to describe it, it is absolutely essential that there be no racial discrimination against any particular person or any particular culture. Where that is violated&mdash;as it is in this case&mdash;it is a tragedy. There should be almost sacred attention given to the Racial Discrimination Act, and that has not happened here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I just add to something that Senator Bob Collins has said about the High Court. We are, and some of the debate tonight has shown this, in an era of the politics of blame.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3115"> We do not look for solutions so much any more as to blame others&mdash;anybody else other than ourselves, our own party or our own position&mdash;and that is a bad thing. The subject recently of the politics of blame is the High Court. I think that once we start denigrating the High Court we start attacking the acceptance that people have of the system. Once people lose respect for the institutions&mdash;whether it is parliament, the government or the court itself&mdash;we are in trouble as to how we operate here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is distinct from other countries where law and order may be enforced by military power or similar power. In Australia, law and order is enforced by the acceptance of the population as a whole. And when you start denigrating an institution like the High Court there are real problems. In fact, the High Court is a most honourable body. It has served Australia well since federation and is presently serving Australia well. That has got to be affirmed again and again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wik decision was decided&mdash;as, for example, the judgment of Mr Justice Gummow shows&mdash;in accordance with the law as it is. If we want to change the law, that is a matter for parliament. But we should not, because we get an inconvenient decision, denigrate the court, as we have. In fact, you get the impression that, had the decision gone the other way, the people who are presently condemning it would have praised it to the high heavens and would have been saying, `Look, you who now show disappointment with the decision in  Wik, it being contrary to the one that actually came out, you should obey the umpire's decision.' So the people who are now inviting us not to obey the umpire's decision are the very people who would have been urging upon us the sanctity of the High Court and the necessity of obeying the umpire's decision if, in fact, the decision had gone their way.</PARA>

We have actually made it. Just to refresh people's memories, the amendment we are actually dealing with relates to the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin. We believe the section of the bill that looks at how money from the trust should be spent on the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin is rather loosely worded. Therefore, we are asking the Senate to consider improved and clearer amendments to the wording that we believe will make it easier for us to achieve the aims and objectives which this government wishes to achieve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While speaking to this amendment, I must just for a moment ask the government a question on an issue that has arisen today which relates to the focus of the Natural Heritage Trust. As we have seen in the media, it seems that there are some considerations by government that this trust rather than focusing on the environment may be redirected to emphasise employment aims and objectives of the government. I note with some concern an interview tonight with the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) who, when asked the question about the refocusing of the trust and the use of the money first and foremost for employment rather than the environment, said, `There are lots of surprises in tomorrow night's budget,' and he refused to further clarify.

I do not know whether you have seen it, Senator Hill. I assume you have. It was headed `PM tags green money for jobs'. That article makes it clear that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has instructed that all fund spending proposals are to be vetted by the employment committee of cabinet to maximise employment creation effects.

In fact, I think the article went so far as to say the sanction of the Prime Minister. That is of course not the case as is evident from the bill before the Senate.

Under this legislation they are appointed for the disbursement of moneys. But the minister has said now that where you have environmental projects which are of equal merit, the employment considerations will come into play. What he has not said, of course, is why you would ever get stuck in the situation where you have two projects and you cannot decide between the two of them. If that were the case, then it might be for the minister to get in some environmental expertise&mdash;the sort in which he is lacking&mdash;so that that decision could be made for him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will find that in the real world where you have competing environmental projects,  you are not going to get into that trouble if you do your homework properly. However, what the minister says is that, in that circumstance, having rejected the Greens's proposal that there be an independent committee of nine people with environmental expertise to sort out just that problem, the matter will go to a cabinet committee which will determine it on the basis of employment. So in fact what we have is not an environmental outcome but a government, economic and employment driven decision making process set there to determine what the ministers cannot determine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, the minister is kidding us when he says that environmental outcomes are to the

The increases in fees of $20 or more per child per week coincided with the decision of many women to leave the work force.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the matter of  a proposed new industrial complex planned for a picturesque stretch of coastline called Oakajee in sight of Geraldton in Western Australia. We have a scandal unfolding at Oakajee. We have a state government again acting in a hasty, arrogant and improper fashion. It is currently pushing and guillotining through the WA state parliament a state agreement act to lock in a major new industrial development without having gone through the most basic and essential processes of community consultation and open environmental and economic assessment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Oakajee site itself has not been subject to formal public and environmental assessment. The way that the environmental assessments are currently being conducted is intended to prevent any comprehensive understanding of the impact of the project. In flouting due process in this way, the WA state government is contravening its own policy on state agreements acts which claims that necessary assessment and consultation processes will be concluded before such agreement acts are developed. Why are existing environmental impact assessments being seriously mishandled? Why are the concerns of the local community being ignored? Who benefits? Whose pockets will be filled?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The WA state government, in its desperation to get this project up and running without proper scrutiny, has committed itself to spending in the order of $400 million to subsidise and underwrite the development. Its coalition colleagues over east are unlikely to spend one dollar saving the Newcastle steel mill. This government is to spend $400 million on another steel mill. The question is: why?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same government which claims it is short of money for schools and hospitals is proposing to commit massive funds from Western Australian and Commonwealth taxpayers to an enterprise which has not been properly assessed and has not been the subject of proper community consultation. This is, in my opinion, a recipe for environmental, social and economic disaster. It smells of entrepreneurial government, of risk taking of an unacceptable level&mdash;of a WA Inc. style approach. How much of this $400 million is Commonwealth money coming from state grants? Does the Commonwealth give money without regard to how it is spent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth has a direct role and responsibility in this matter. The Commonwealth government has made much of its commitment to and involvement in issues to do with coastal and marine management and conservation all around Australia. In August last year, Senator MacGibbon was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper as launching a new Commonwealth coastal planning initiative and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3121"> allocating some $100 million from the sale of Telstra to implement proper coastal planning and pollution control processes. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . industry expansion in coastal zones presents a serious risk to the national coastline . . . a succession of small decisions has produced fragmented and inefficient coastal management . . . A co&hyphen;operative integrated approach to coastal planning and management, as outlined in the Federal government's coastal policy, would ensure that talk became action.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is no sign of this commitment being met in the case of Oakajee. Worthy initiatives and expressions of concern from the Commonwealth are being mocked by the Oakajee development. Let me refer to an article written by Brian Miller in the April edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">WA Business News</EMPHASIS> . The article castigates the state government for its lack of clear industry policy and its ad hoc and inconsistent involvement in industrial development. Mr Miller, in referring to the Oakajee project, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . what is certain is that the government is driven by short term opportunism not a long term strategy . . . </PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article goes on to point out that, by subsidising the project to the tune of $300 million&mdash;it is now $400 million&mdash;the 1,000 jobs created will cost the government $300,000 each&mdash;it is now $400,000 each. The strategy of the WA government, such as it is, is to proliferate new heavy industrial sites on the WA coastline. Using this scattergun approach, they have decided that the Oakajee site is one suitable place and they seem hell&hyphen;bent on forcing the project through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a means to get the whole project up and running, a company called Kingstream Resources NL, which is headed by the Premier's brother, Ken Court, has been used as the lead company. I am concerned that a local company headed by the Premier's brother has made itself available to the government as a trojan horse to get this new industrial site off the ground. The project also has Taiwanese backing through the large steel company An Feng Steel Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent reports indicate that Kingstream Resources NL, Ken Court's company, and An Feng Australia Ltd, the Taiwanese company,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are going to merge to form a subsidiary company of the large Taiwanese steel company. The public of WA and the public of the Commonwealth should be told much more about the nature of this merger and if this arrangement will lead to opportunities for the Taiwanese parent company to engage in transfer pricing or any other pricing or taxation stratagems. If transfers of profits occur and if taxes are minimised, such financial gains as might have come from this project could quickly be lost in terms of Australian benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Geraldton, which is WA's third largest city, already has an established industrial estate called Narngalu. Geraldton has also established industry infrastructure, including a port. To upgrade this and use existing investment, existing facilities and existing unemployed labour would cost much less than $400 million. Again, I and the Australian Democrats ask who benefits? Whose pockets are to get filled with this Commonwealth and WA taxpayer funded $400 million?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Narngalu industrial site six kilometres south-east of Geraldton was the original proposed site for a steel mill. The EPA conducted a public environmental review of this project and approved it. It was subsequently decided that existing pollution levels were bad enough without adding to them. It does not seem wise if Geraldton has serious pollution problems at its existing site to now look to repeating the dose on the coast to its north. Given that the Oakajee site is only some five kilometres from the nearest Geraldton residential area, Drummond Cove, it cannot be argued that this new site will protect residents from pollution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the state needs more heavy industry in this region, it should be located close to existing infrastructure. If the government has $400 million to spend on encouraging industry and jobs in the Geraldton area, that money would be much better spent on cleaning up the existing Geraldton industrial zone to world best industrial practice standard. This would then allow for further environmentally acceptable industries to set up in the existing zone utilising existing infrastructure and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3122"> would do away with the need to destroy Oakajee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other sites more suitable for the steel mill project, including a cleaned up site at Narngalu, or sites inland and closer to the mine itself in the Mullewa Shire need to be publicly, independently and objectively examined and assessed on economic, social and environmental grounds. In 1993, a petition signed by some 3,500 Geraldton people was tabled in the state parliament expressing concern about the Oakajee development. There are many legitimate concerns amongst the local community over the siting of the project at Oakajee in terms of expected impacts on the marine environment, the expected and possible impacts of pollution, the site's geological suitability and the hydrological problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other valuable economic uses of the area are also endangered, including fishing and international tourism based on sailboard sports, which together are worth many millions of dollars. The WA government's priorities are biased towards powerful vested interest and big industrial projects. As a result, once again, small business, fishing and tourism which currently benefit from the Oakajee area are now in danger. If the state government has $400 million to spend in the Geraldton region, there are probably many other ways the community could use that money to create lasting employment and sustainable economic benefits without having to put smokestack industries at Oakajee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">WA Inc. taught Western Australians to be suspicious of grand government schemes favouring powerful corporate interests that are not subject to full and open scrutiny. I and the Australian Democrats are not alone in our  fears. I am aware that there are members of the WA coalition government who are extremely concerned about process, costs and the guarantees. They will not want to be dragged before the public at some future date. Every notion of careful, intelligent, cooperative and sustainable coastal management and development is being tossed out the window with Oakajee. The Commonwealth must not turn its back on this fact.</PARA>

Mr Holding in his observations of Canberra's development and his thoughts on the uniqueness of the ACT as a city state and the nation's capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important point that members of both sides of parliament made in the debate over the ACT's debut into the political world was the fact that the ACT enjoyed the status of being a community and the seat of the federal government. This brings me to the point of this adjournment debate tonight. `Enjoy' is not a word that we are using at the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3123"> moment in Canberra. It is not a word that the people of Canberra are using to describe being a regional centre and the national capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the coalition government the honour of being the capital of Australia has become a burden that members of my community are finding extremely difficult and extremely unrewarding to bear. When self&hyphen;government was introduced, the ACT Labor party worked to provide a model of government that was responsive to the needs of its members whilst maintaining a standard of infrastructure that was required of a city which is always on the national and international stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Canberra acknowledge that their standard of living compares well. For the record, there has been an increase in the proportion of two&hyphen;income families, and that has boosted the average income. We enjoy unpolluted air, comparatively minimal traffic congestion and lots of trees. But we do so humbly, recognising that many other communities have also suffered through recessions. Such are the things that come with being the nation's capital&mdash;a city that, when held up to international standards, can thankfully hold its own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of Canberra's strengths of course is that we are a relatively new city. In 1927, when Parliament House was first opened, we had a population of 7,685. In 1970 it had grown to 130,000&hyphen;plus and now stands at over 300,000. Regionally, the population is over 500,000, clearly identifying Canberra as an important regional centre&mdash;a fact that is often sadly lost in the current debate about our role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our heritage and history are therefore contemporary. On the surface they hold little of the colonial mysticism of Sofala and the Rocks. Rather, our heritage is inextricably  linked to our political development as a nation and our social and democratic progression. Perhaps this is the key to Canberra's struggles in the PR stakes with the rest of Australia. Politics, politicians, government, et cetera, are held in dubious regard by the majority of our population&mdash;with recent scandals only reinforcing this sentiment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, the readiness of some politicians to use Canberra as a convenient scratch
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing post serves only their short&hyphen;sighted populist agenda and fuels `wedge politics' or the selling of a sentiment in place of a policy. Hence, Canberra bashing becomes a political tool in the hands of a conservative government such as that in power now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How to deal with these specific challenges and fend off such attacks confronts us as a community right at this moment. As an elected representative of this place I can argue that there is victimisation and unfair targeting of cuts by virtue of our industry blend. I can demand that it stop and that due consideration of our citizens be given. And I will continue to argue those points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But do these arguments penetrate the minds of those whose political agenda ventures not outside the driest of dry economic rationalism? Only money talks to them. So I turn my attention to the fiscal structures that underpin the Commonwealth financial contribution to this place. The Grants Commission is the body through which the Commonwealth allocates its contribution to the states and territories from revenues raised through taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The methodologies that are applied therefore provide one of the few windows of opportunity through which the citizens and their representatives of the ACT can argue for a fair go. The problems with the Grants Commission's methodologies, however, are infamous. Since 1933, the commission's methodologies have changed significantly but standardisation has still resulted in a complicated model that is based on an adversarial system of states pitted against each other for funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Grants Commission reviews its allocations every five years and the ACT has completed its submission to the 1999 review. Many issues were raised in this submission but, as with all states, the ACT does not enjoy bringing attention to its situation when we know that, for us to get more money, other states have to lose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are just three issues that I want to bring to the attention of the Senate. First, as the nation's capital, my community witnessed the security arrangements for the visit of the US President, Bill Clinton. It was hard to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3124"> ignore secret service personnel in and around the parliamentary triangle and the resources that were utilised for the visit. One example of those resources was that of the police of the ACT. For the residents of Canberra, it is a pay&hyphen;off that we have to accept that, during a visit of a dignitary, above and beyond the work of security forces the level of policing will be concentrated on the safety and security of visiting dignitaries and their clean passage whilst in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point that defines Canberra's uniqueness is the fact that we are landlocked within another jurisdiction. The constraints placed on the ACT because of our borders have limited our future growth potential. An issue involved in this quite specifically is having two distinct planning authorities&mdash;one representing the interests of our role as the nation's capital, the other the growth and expansion of the issues facing the territory government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point that is more easily quantifiable relates to cross&hyphen;border issues. An example of this, according to the information I have received, is that an entire ACT college could be filled with students from outside the ACT. Also, the reality of health care is that New South Wales residents in surrounding regions must at times need to access the ACT's advanced health facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However the Grants Commission has overlooked factors such as these when equating the financial needs of the ACT against other states. There is no parallel. The Grants Commission has been slow to recognise that the ACT cannot be treated like any other state or territory in their process of calculating finances. With up to 20 per cent of ACT services being used by non&hyphen;residents of the ACT, we are unique.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The infrastructure and ongoing maintenance of the roads networks has translated into the ACT inheriting a liability. And that can be used as another example of paying up&hyphen;front on a liability inherited from the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the local front, unfortunately, misguided priorities have become a feature of the local Liberals' budget strategies, with unsustainable
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> budget revenue sources used to pay for flawed programs sadly contributing to the territory's dilemma rather than offering sound solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the state of New South Wales lost 2,368 square kilometres of its land in 1911, the nation's capital was born. On 11 May 1989, self&hyphen;government was proclaimed and the people said we had come of age. In 1997, at 86 years young, the current federal government has abandoned the nation's capital in more ways than one and the people of the ACT are feeling decidedly beleaguered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government must take responsibility for the nation's capital. The targeting of Canberra and the refusal of John Howard to live here show an immaturity attributable to no other government and it does not do Australia proud at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say these things tonight not to put in yet another plea for the ACT to this government with the pending budget, but to bring to the attention of people all around Australia that the ACT is unique in some very special ways, including the fact that it is the nation's capital. I ask that this government take into account those issues before they embark upon their next round of cutting funding which will not just affect the public sector or public sector employees here, but also severely damage and limit the growth of the private sector as we move from the emphasis being on our public sector to being on our private sector.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="3124"><TITLE>Youth: Poverty</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to put on the public record my concerns that, despite the warm and fuzzy words of governments over the decades, many young Australians face poverty. This is not about sympathy or paying for the problem to go away; this is about justice and equity and that much talked about civil society. It is about complex social relationships, cooperation, social capital, civic culture and positive social outcomes. By poverty, I am talking about relative poverty where a standard of living taking into account assets, income, diet, housing, health care, lack of access to or depravation of resources, et cetera is below a standard of living that we as
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3125"> the majority of people in this community find acceptable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say at the outset that poverty is a structural issue for our society. It is about how we accommodate and care for a group in our community and the way we structure our government's policies and actions to care for that particular group's interests. Blaming poor people for being poor and hassling them to do something about their predicament without providing them with a means to do so does not solve problems. Telling homeless people or long-term unemployed young people to get a job to better themselves does not solve their poverty, as they do not have some of the basics that are necessary for getting a job, such as a contact address, interview clothes for a good impression, transport to the interview, and the list goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to point out that there is a divide occurring in Australia between the haves and the have nots and that this is a move away from our country's egalitarian goals. The number of households earning what we might consider a good income has increased, but so has the number earning what is a poor income. This division shows the increased representation of the lower income group for whom poverty becomes a real concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an address to ACOSS in October 1995, the Prime Minister, John Howard, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All Australians should have access to an adequate income, affordable housing, quality health care and a level of education that enables them to fully achieve their potential.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Supposedly, the present government began with good intentions and initiated a youth homeless pilot program and an early intervention and prevention program with community groups. These programs are a start, but they are a long way short of the serious action needed to address youth poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we see from the government is a drive to reform welfare by injecting market principles into social life, moving to re&hyphen;establish the primacy of family responsibility so that turning to government funded welfare becomes the second or the last resort. This places a burden of responsibility on the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> individual for their predicament and fuels the perception that welfare programs are too large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training in its report in 1992 viewed unemployment as the single greatest contributor to poverty. Australian studies, such as Whiteford, Bradbury and Saunders in 1988, link unemployment with poverty. The Morgan and Banks job index, February to April 1997, asked a large number of organisations what government policies and programs would make their organisations more likely to employ young people. The answers provide an interesting view of what employers think.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The results showed that only three per cent of organisations think that high quality job placement services are likely to result in increased attractiveness to employing young people. Fifteen per cent of organisations think cash or tax incentives and wage subsidies are likely to result in increased attractiveness to employing young people, and 24 per cent of employers think industry relevant training is likely to result in increased attractiveness to employing young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, this survey also showed that 11 per cent of organisations would not consider employing a young or unemployed person. Morgan and Banks attribute this to negative stereotypes and generalisations about young people and the unemployed. I must say that many of those negative perceptions have been perpetuated in this very place. The survey also shows that some organisations are not prepared to participate in the training of young people and want someone else to foot that training bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have talked before about the numbers of unemployed young people and the cutting of youth employment programs. What I have said shows that the present government's commitment, as set out in their election policies, has not been followed. They continue to wait for the egg to hatch, already knowing it will not happen. The Morgan and Banks survey challenges the government's reliance on employers and highlights the requirement for industry relevant training.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3126">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is of great concern is the body of evidence which shows that young people without jobs are being increasingly marginalised. The Williams study in 1987, which followed a number of young people from 1975 to 1986, showed that people from poorer families were more likely to leave school early. Without training, they tend to make up the ranks of the unemployed, as they are unable to compete against more qualified and trained people and, in the part-time job market, against competing students. These young people then become the long-term unemployed subsisting on benefits. These marginalised young people face barriers to gaining or regaining employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993 ACOSS research conducted for the task force on employment opportunities identified barriers to employment for the long&hyphen;term unemployed, including not enough appropriate jobs, not enough financial resources, not enough income, lack of relevant vocational training, employer discrimination, low self&hyphen;esteem, low motivation and presentation, poor health, lack of housing, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Measuring poverty is difficult because it relies on economic and social conditions. The make&hyphen;up of the family grouping and the particular necessary expenses of individuals all add up to make the measure difficult. However, there are benchmark measures which have been examined since 1973 and presented as a disposable income per week to satisfy the basic needs of a family of two adults and two children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Based on the June quarter 1995 data, the Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research suggested the single person poverty line was around $177 per week. At that time, social security entitlements for a similar person were around $185 a week. Social security is not the lifestyle of riches and leisure and does not provide a great opportunity to get ahead, contrary to some suggestions that are often floated in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Welfare reform must be based on real politics and a real understanding of the barriers to escaping poverty. Idealised concepts of labour markets, the ability of families to deal with welfare on their own scarce resources, an
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> exclusive rather than inclusive definition of the public good and the perception that welfare programs are too big all need to be addressed. The pursuit of economic numbers
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3127"> to the exclusion of all else fails a just and equitable community and that much talked about civil society. These are difficult issues and they require concerted action. Madam President, let us hope this government will soon act&mdash;hopefully as of tomorrow night's budget&mdash;as there is a desperate need for federal leadership in this area.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="11.37 p.m." PAGE="3127"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 11.37 p.m.</EMPHASIS>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable Senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Under the current legislation not all amounts paid in excess of entitlement are legally recoverable debts. Data is not maintained on the value of these excess payments which are not legally recoverable debts. However, in the 12 month period from 1 March 1996 to 28 February 1997 there were
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3128"> 863,695 legally recoverable debts raised under the Social Security Act 1991 (the Act) with a value of $471.88M, and 4,314 debts raised under the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973 (in respect of Youth Training Allowance administered by the Department) with a value of $1.03M.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a)&hyphen;(c) It is not possible to provide the precise information requested. However, in 1996 it was estimated that 4.4% of legally recoverable debts arose because of administrative error. It was also estimated that 52.1% of debts arose as a result of failure by the recipient to comply with their notification obligations under the legislation, a portion only of which involved false statements or false representation. Although these debts involve some element of `fault' on the recipient's part, not all would have involved a deliberate attempt to defraud the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other major reasons or categories of debts were estimated as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> 11.6% of debts were outstanding Newstart advance payments;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) There is no available reliable total estimate of the cost of fraud to DSS. Serious cases of fraud are prosecuted where the Director of Public Prosecutions considers it is in the public interest to do so; based on the guidelines set out in the Prosecution Policy of the Commonwealth; including whether there are reasonable prospects of a conviction. There is no available figure on the total number of cases which involved deliberate intent on the part of a customer or other person. As noted above, a significant number of debts arise because of failure to advise a change in circumstances, although not all of these instances would be fraudulent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)(a) The Department is not in a position to assess the incidence of fraud in other areas. The Department accepts that relative to total outlays, the incidence of fraud in the social security system is modest, but notes that even a small proportion involves a significant amount of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)(b) It is agreed that most overpayments are relatively small amounts and most of the money is recovered. However, as outlined in (2) above, it is not correct that most overpayments are identified by information volunteered by customers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The United States maintains nuclear forces to deter their use by others and to contribute to the deterrence of conventional warfare between the major powers. The end of the Cold War has allowed the status of nuclear weapons as weapons of last resort to be further emphasised through significant reductions in the number of deployed strategic and tactical systems; through agreements between the United States and the Russian Federation to de&hyphen;target strategic nuclear missiles so that their aim points while on alert are a point in the ocean rather than targets in the other country; and through the removal of all tactical nuclear weapons from surface naval vessels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Joint Defence Facility Nurrungar continues to make an essential contribution to the stability of nuclear deterrence by providing early warning of ballistic missile launches. It further contributes to global and regional security by inhibiting the proliferation of ballistic missiles. The Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap contributes to monitoring of compliance with arms control agreements, including the agreements that seek to make deterrence more stable and provide for lower levels of nuclear armament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The capability of the facility at North West Cape to relay communications from US command centres to submerged strategic ballistic missile submarines contributed significantly to the stability of deterrence by underlining the inevitability of retaliation in the event of a nuclear attack. This function is now less urgent, but the capability of the station to communicate with Australian and US ships and submarines in the Indian Ocean and the Western Pacific remains important to both the RAN and the USN. The joint facility is now run entirely by the RAN, under the command of an RAN officer; it will be come an Australian Naval Communication Station in 1999.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable Senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) If a Widow Allowance recipient obtained full&hyphen;time employment and within 13 weeks decided that she was not able to continue that employment, in most cases she could return to Widow Allowance. However, if her period of full&hyphen;time employment was 13 weeks or more, she would not immediately requalify for Widow Allowance because she would have `recent workforce experience'. (`Recent workforce experience' is defined as work of at least 20 hours per week for 13 weeks or more, at any time during the 12 months prior to claiming Widow Allowance.) In this situation, the woman would need to apply for Newstart Allowance. If the  woman was unsuccessful at finding further employment after 9 months in receipt of Newstart Allowance, she may then requalify for Widow Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes. See response to question (1).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (a) The requirement for no `recent workforce experience' is not a disincentive to participate in the workforce. Instead, this provision ensures that women who are able to support themselves through employment are encouraged to do so. A woman with `recent workforce experience' is considered to be more job ready and more able to benefit from the active job seeking emphasis of Newstart Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (b) It might be regarded by some as a benefit for women with `recent workforce experience' to be able to requalify immediately for Widow Allowance and not have to meet the activity test. The disadvantage of allowing these women to requalify immediately for Widow Allowance is the reduced exposure to the active job seeking emphasis of Newstart Allowance and the lack of incentive to participate in employment. As participation in employment provides greater long term financial security than long term dependence on income support, any perceived benefit needs to be carefully weighed against the loss of access to the opportunity for long term employment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health and Family Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The vaccines included under the 7 point plan are those recommended by the National Health and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3131"> Medical Research Council (NHMRC). The NHMRC recommends that children receive the first dose of Oral Poliomyelitis Vaccine (OPV), Diphtheria&hyphen;Tetanus&hyphen;Pertussis (DTP) and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) at 2 months of age. Measles&hyphen;Mumps&hyphen;Rubella (MMR) is recommended at 12 months of age.2.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) Due to the varying nature of individual diseases and the efficacy of vaccines, two examples only are addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) Pertussis (whooping cough) is an extremely infectious disease. Up to 90 per cent of unimmunised individuals in households where there is a case of pertussis contract the disease. Since whooping cough is not only highly infectious, but also causes severe disease, the risks of complications or even death for each unimmunised child are high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) Measles is virtually universal amongst unimmunised children in all countries. Eventually, 99.9 per cent of people who have not been immunised will contract measles, and 90 per cent will do so before the age of 20.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Vaccine efficacy is a measure of the level of protection against a disease in children who have been vaccinated compared with the attack rate in children who have not been vaccinated. Pertussis  vaccine has generally been shown to be 85&hyphen;95 per cent efficacious. Measles vaccine has been shown to be 95 per cent efficacious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Many children experience some symptoms following vaccination. Most of these only last a short time and the child recovers without any problems. Reactions can include swelling and redness at the injection site, moderate fever, crying or irritability. Measles Mumps and Rubella vaccination may be followed about 10 days later by a fever lasting 2&hyphen;3 days, malaise and/or rash. These reactions do not contraindicate further vaccination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Doctors and other immunisation providers should ensure that the individual to be vaccinated does not have a condition (or history of a previous condition) which increases the risk of a severe reaction.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Some vaccines contain a very small dose of a live, non&hyphen;harmful form of a virus. Some vaccines contain a very small dose of killed bacteria, and other vaccines contain a small dose of a modified toxin produced by bacteria or small parts of bacteria. Vaccines also contain either a small amount of preservative or a small amount of an antibiotic to preserve the vaccine. Some vaccines also contain a small amount of an aluminium salt which helps the immune response.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPENING REMARKS</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The management of Commonwealth Fisheries is currently subject to an inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs following the tabling of the ANAO report. Further, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has tabled its report into the Bilateral Agreement and a Government response is pending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committees are considering a number of the matters raised by Senator Margetts making it inappropriate to comment on them at length. Of the ANAO's 39 recommendations, AFMA accepts twelve (and part of another), accepts in principle a further fifteen (and part of two others) and disagrees with ten.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The response provided below relates to foreign fishing in the AFZ and, specifically, to the new bilateral fishing agreement with Japan. However, it should be noted that the questions asked appear to mix domestic issues with foreign issues and have been answered only in terms of foreign fishing. This is particularly the case with the issues raised in 3(b), 3(c) and 3(d).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bilateral Agreement enables the operators of Japanese vessels to take tuna and associated species within the terms and conditions of access specified in an annually negotiated agreement. The predominant species is yellowfin tuna followed by big-eye tuna and broadbill swordfish. The SBT catch by Japanese vessels in the AFZ is limited to 400 tonnes and any catch against this amount is deducted from Japan's national catch allocation granted to it by the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The 1996 FAO report on the state of world fisheries and aquaculture provides analysis of trends in 200 of the major fish resources of the world, which account for 77 percent of the world's fisheries landed catch. The analysis suggests that 35 percent are overfished, 35 percent are fully fished and 40 percent of fisheries are still developing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In considering these figures two important features should be borne in mind:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> 1) that the FAO compiles these figures on a global basis from information provided by member nations and that the data and analysis and by their nature broad and subject to the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3133"> accuracy of the data supplied. As such, the Government is not in a position to assess the veracity of them;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> 2) the figures provided by FAO incorporates `commercial' fishing, which by implication suggests that any fishery subject to commercial fishing would have its total biomass reduced, to the point of being `fully fished'. In this context, it is misleading to interpret the aggregated figure as an indicator of the state of degradation of fisheries. Clearly a fully fished commercial fishery may be an ideal situation to be in from both an economic and conservation perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this context it is not realistic to use either the overall figure or its component figures to do anything more than to draw the inference, as the FAO report does, that the worlds fisheries need effective management, a proposition that the Government accepts fully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The FAO report goes on to comment that with improved, sustainable management of the worlds fisheries and aquaculture, substantial increases in catch are possible. The report suggests a range of approaches to achieve this, particularly noting the need to address the globalisation of fisheries, related to expanding global trade and the international mobility of investment capital. Fisheries management, to a large extent, is subject to such influences and its effectiveness is becoming increasingly dependent on addressing these issues.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this context, Australia has played a major participatory role in developing a series of instruments aimed at managing the world's fisheries in a sustainable and responsible way. Australia played a key role in developing and establishing international conventions and agreements, including the United Nations Agreement on Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and Straddling Fish Stocks. Core elements of the new instruments are being given effect through Australia's active participation in regional management regimes, including the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, as well as the Forum Fisheries Agency and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. Australia is recognised internationally as having some of the best managed fisheries in the world, and as being a producer of high quality seafood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Government does not intend to make such a nomination. I understand representations requesting that southern bluefin tuna be listed on Appendix II to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) were received by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment. The Minister and I have had consultations on a listing under the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Convention. The listing of southern bluefin tuna will not now be considered at the forthcoming conference of parties to the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this respect, it is important to note that international co-operation in the conservation and management of SBT is well established through the CCSBT. A recovery program is in place for the stock; a global total allowable catch (TAC) and national quota allocations apply to member countries; and vigorous attempts are being made to encourage non-member countries whose fishing fleets take SBT to join the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conservation and management of highly migratory fish stocks and straddling fish stocks requires the co-operation of both coastal States and distant water fishing nations (DWFNs). Such co-operation is embodied in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and the related UN Fish Stocks Agreement, which establishes a comprehensive regime for the conservation and management of transboundary fisheries resources. The provisions of UNCLOS and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement are to be given effect through regional fisheries regimes such as the CCSBT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the broader issue of marine fish species subject to large scale commercial harvesting and international trade will be discussed at the forthcoming conference of the parties to CITES. The USA has proposed that, in response to concerns about the technical and practical issues associated with listing such fish on the Convention, a working group will be established to analyse these issues and make recommendations on how they should be dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) a) AFMA agrees that southern bluefin tuna (SBT) stocks are below desired ESD biological levels and has played an active role in having this issue addressed internationally. Australia has been involved in the international management of SBT since 1983, through an informal Trilateral Management Group, which was formalised in 1994 through the CCSBT. The CCSBT is an international Commission to which Australia, Japan and New Zealand are parties. It's primary function is to manage the global SBT stock. The CCSBT has a key biological management objective of rebuilding the parental stock to the 1980 level by the year 2020. A major focus of the Commission is to encourage non-parties, principally Indonesia, Taiwan and Korea, whose catches are increasing in significance, to join CCSBT or introduce complementary management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) This ANAO comment appears to refer to domestic fisheries arrangements rather than to foreign fishing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to data collection from the Japanese fleet the level of compliance is very high. Operators are required to report position, effort and catch
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3134"> of target and non target species to AFMA on a daily basis via satellite based vessel monitoring systems (VMS). The data includes catch by weight and number of target species and non target species, and individual lengths and weights of each SBT taken. Catch data is verified through the use of an on-board observer programme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The requirement to report via VMS was introduced in 1996 to replace the daily radio reporting system. As the collection of data via VMS is a recent innovation, the Japanese vessel operators are required at this stage to also complete logbooks on a daily basis, as was the case with radio reporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) Again the ANAO comment appears to refer to domestic fisheries arrangements rather than to foreign fishing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to foreign fishing, AFMA has implemented a number of measures to ensure compliance arrangements are adhered to by foreign operators. Under the terms and conditions of the Bilateral Agreement, the Japanese longline fleet are required to report position, effort and catch on a daily basis, are subject to pre and post fishing inspections, and at sea inspections. At the pre fishing inspection Japanese fishing masters are thoroughly briefed on the conditions on their licence and the codes of conduct in place under the Bilateral Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, AFMA has in place an on-board observer programme which, depending on the region in the AFZ, covers between 10 and 30% of all fishing trips in the AFZ by Japanese vessels. This assists in the verification of figures provided by the Japanese and also enables AFMA to gain information to continuously improve the bilateral management arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1991 a Japanese boat was detected misreporting catch made in the AFZ. Subsequent prosecution of the Master of this boat for breaching conditions of his foreign fishing licence lead to the forfeiture of the Japanese longline boat and its catch. At the time this amounted to a $4.5 million penalty. Subsequent to this prosecution Japanese boats have been subject to more rigorous controls including freezer hold inspections in port and at sea, a higher level of observer coverage and daily catch reporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">AFMA is generally very confident in the reporting of retained catch by Japanese longline boats. Since 1991 the detected offences and associated prosecutions have been related to a much lower level of misreporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) This ANAO comment and response relates to domestic fisheries management arrangements, noting that the bilateral process will be covered under the response to 4(c) below.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">AFMA has been working closely with the Environment Protection Agency (now the Environ
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment Protection Group (EPG) within Environment Australia) since late 1994 on Commonwealth fishery decisions which have environmental significance. AFMA has designated as environmentally significant under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, the South East Trawl, East Coast Tuna and Southern Shark management plans along with the Macquarie Island and Heard/McDonald Island management policies and the 1997 total allowable catch (TAC) for eastern gemfish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) (a) AFMA is of the view that the Bilateral Agreement conforms to AFMA's ecologically sustainable development objective, noting that tuna species targeted by the Japanese while fishing in the AFZ are part of wider stocks that extend well beyond the boundaries of the AFZ.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In developing Australia's position for the bilateral negotiations AFMA and DPIE seek the views of a wide range of Government and non Government bodies, and incorporates the views of scientists, industry (through Management Advisory Committees), environment agencies, conservation groups, recreational fishing groups and State Governments. Consideration is given to the impacts of fishing on both target and non target species. The negotiating position is cleared through the Prime Minister and the relevant Commonwealth Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tuna and billfish stocks are managed through a variety of international fora, including CCSBT, the Forum Fisheries Committee and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission. Advice on stock status is provided by either a Scientific Committee or a scientific body associated with each management regime, and Australian scientists have a major input in provision of this advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">AFMA provides advice on the status of those parts of the stocks that exist in the AFZ through an annual fishery assessment process. These fisheries assessments, which draw together all available scientific advice, are available as public documents. AFMA's assessments form part of the Australian view on tuna fisheries in the wider Indo-Pacific region which it takes to international fisheries meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should also be noted that Australia has signed and ratified the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea which, whilst bringing benefits, also requires it to give consideration to providing access to foreign fishing operations where domestic operators are not yet able to take full advantage of a fishery. In short, Japanese vessels take the fish that domestic operators are unable to take, and their combined catches are believed to be sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) As indicated in the response to question 3(c), the Japanese bilateral vessels are subjected to a wide range of monitoring provisions to enable monitoring and assessment of fisheries stocks,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3135"> including southern bluefin tuna. These include pre and post fishing inspections, observer coverage, and daily position, effort and catch reporting amongst others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to stock monitoring, a number of long-term research programs are in place to monitor the distribution, abundance, age structure and length-frequency on SBT in the AFZ. This comprises both Australian research and collaborative work between Australian and Japanese scientists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) The Bilateral Agreement is between the Japanese and Australian Governments, therefore matters relating to Australia's part in it are determined by the Minister for Resources and Energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Resources and Energy (the Minister) considers the Agreement in relation to, among other things, the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 (EPIP Act), which requires proposals that are environmentally significant to be referred to Environment Australia for examination. If a decision is believed to be environmentally significant by the Minister then s/he can designate it under the EPIP Act. With regard to designation, DPIE provides advice to the Minister on the Agreement and its implications, including environmental significance and other relevant matters. The Minister is currently considering the application of the EPIP Act to the 1997 Bilateral Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) The response provided to question 3(c) addresses this question and in conjunction with the attached table, clearly indicate that the penalties are sufficient to deter non-compliance.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The attached table provides a summary of prosecutions of Japanese longline vessels since 1990 (Bilateral and joint venture).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) The Bilateral Agreement makes specific reference to billfish, including marlin, and sharks which are taken incidentally in longline operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Agreement billfish (except broadbill swordfish) are not to be targeted deliberately by Japanese fishing vessels, and there is a voluntary code under which all blue marlin and black marlin which are alive at the time of longline retrieval are released. AFMA monitors this through the daily catch reports and the observer program. For the 1995/1996 year, there is no evidence of billfish targeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Historically, in recognition of concerns over the catch of billfish a range of area closures and restrictions on fishing methods have been applied to the Japanese fleet. These include the exclusion from the East Coast Tuna and Billfish Fishery area off Cairns known as Area E, and 50 nautical mile closures off the east and west coasts of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Japan has historically finned sharks and discarded the carcasses. The shark code of conduct requires
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the carcasses to be retained and `trunked'. This is to reduce wastage and encourage the development of a market for sharks. Through the observer program compliance with the code appears to be generally good, although AFMA remains concerned that some token trunking does still occur. Australia has requested Japan to take this matter up directly with its fleet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Given that a World Wide fund for nature study in the southern ocean found that 44,000 albatross were being killed annually by Japanese longliners, what is the Government's scientific advice about the level of reduction of incidental catch of albatross and other seabirds that will be achieved when operating south of latitude 30 degrees through the use of tori pole devices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 44,000 figure was an estimate based on observations made on Japanese longline vessels in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3136"> waters adjacent to Tasmania in 1988 when the SBT quota levels were considerably higher than they are now. In 1988 Japan's national SBT catch allocation was 19,500 tonnes compared to 6065 tonnes since 1990. As a result the number of hooks set by Japan now are considerably less than in 1988. Japanese longline effort in the Southern Ocean is now approximately half what it was in the mid to late 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also important to note that, of a national SBT allocation of 6065 tonnes, Japan has only sought to fish 600 tonnes of its allocation in the AFZ under the Bilateral Agreement in recent years. Much of Japan's catch is taken on the high seas where Australian regulations do not apply. The seabird issue is being addressed more broadly through the Ecologically Related Species Working Group of CCSBT which is a forum to focus on high seas fishing operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tori poles became mandatory in the AFZ south of 30 degrees for the 1995/1996 Agreement and for the 1996/1997 Agreement SBT catches in the AFZ by Japanese boats has been reduced to 400 tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although there is no information on the specific effect of tori poles in reducing seabird bycatch, a recent report by CSIRO suggests that seabird bycatch (including albatross) within the AFZ has reduced by a half to one eighth since 1988. Tori poles would certainly have contributed to this reduction. It has been noted that many Japanese vessels use tori poles and other mitigation measures when operating outside the AFZ.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992, a Threat Abatement Plan to reduce the threat of longline fishing on seabirds is being prepared. Additionally, under that legislation a Recovery Plan for the Macquarie Island population of wandering albatross is being prepared. Both of these plans will provide for specific targets and monitoring and research to enable the efficacy of mitigation measures, including tori poles, to be quantitatively assessed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The EU applies a series of tariff quotas for both uncooked and cooked pig meat.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) Australia applies no tariffs on uncooked pig meat and the tariff binding on uncooked pig meat is zero. Australia has a tariff binding on cooked pig meat which ranges between 12.5% and 20% depending on the specific product. This tariff binding will be reduced to between 10% and 11% by the year 2,000 in line with our Uruguay Round commitments. Our current applied rate of duty for cooked pig meat is 5%, however, imports of cooked pig meat from Canada would not be subject to duty under concessional arrangements as part of the Canada Australia Trade Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) There are no specific Government programs in place other than the marketing and promotional program managed by the Australian Pork Corporation, which is funded by statutory industry levies; and the research and development (R&amp;D) program managed by the Pig Research and Development Corporation, which receives a Commonwealth contribution to match industry R&amp;D expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are however, a range of generic programs available which would assist eligible applicants from the pork industry. Examples of such programs include the Rural Adjustment Scheme, AusIndustry programs and Export Market Development Scheme, and other programs administered by AusTrade. For example, should the members of the pork industry apply, AusTrade could assist with trade shows, contacts and promotion. Assistance would be provided on a fee paying basis, but this fee does not fully recover costs.</PARA>
