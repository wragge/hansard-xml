<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Opposition amendment No. 6 opposes schedule 5. Essentially, the effect of our amendment would be to provide that the superannuation of veterans between the age of 55 and retirement age in particular would not be taken into account in determining their access to benefits. The effect of removal of the deeming for veterans in budgetary terms is relatively small. We believe that, in particular, veterans are a class of persons who should not be treated harshly and that we have particular responsibilities to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them. As I have stated previously and as the opposition has stated very clearly, we are opposed on principle to deeming on the basis of superannuation. We strenuously oppose measures which adversely affect veterans, as schedule 5 of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996&hyphen;97 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1997 does.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Schedule 5 of the veterans' affairs bill seeks to mirror a change made to the Social Security Act late last year. That change was to include the value of superannuation assets in the social security means test and the schedule makes a similar change to the veterans' affairs act. The Australian Democrats opposed this move late last year and will be opposing it again today. We do so on the following grounds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first one is to perhaps reply to the government's arguments, which I have listened to carefully&mdash;that is, savings should not be treated differently. But the whole point of superannuation is that there was cross-party agreement when the superannuation system was set up that in fact it would be treated differently. That was the whole point of the exercise. It is not only me who says that but in fact many people on the Liberal side who, of course, because of party discipline, are unable to vote the way they feel.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously they would not ring you, Minister, because you are not going to listen to them. That is why they are desperately ringing other people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="NEWMAN" NAMEID="BE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator Newman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It's a party decision.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it is. That is exactly what I am saying. It is a party decision, so they are unable to do anything about their frustration and apprehension about this bill. I am saying to you, Minister, that I do not accept one of your fundamental arguments&mdash;that is, somehow or other savings are the same. Deliberately and on a multiparty basis for at least four years&mdash;and this is what
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5432"> the electorate understands&mdash;we have been working on the assumption that superannuation would be treated differently from other savings. That is the fundamental point in this whole argument. So I reject the government's argument on that basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On some of the other grounds, we believe that superannuation assets should be exempt to ensure that the nest eggs of many people who have worked hard to provide for their retirement are protected. In other words, it is pointless telling people over a long period of time, `This is what you should do,' and, when they finally get to the stage where they need to absolutely ensure that those nest eggs are protected so they can look after themselves in retirement, then change the rules and say, `No, we're going to make you cut into that nest egg so that you'll no longer be able to do what you thought the government was telling you to do for many years.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we believe that it is unfair for the government to encourage people into superannuation through tax breaks and the like and then clearly penalise those people for having followed that encouragement. This is the problem. I do not think the government understands what it does to people when it changes the rules after a long period of time when they have been doing what they thought the government was telling them to do. It changes the rules and leaves them stranded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole move should be opposed because it threatens public confidence and support for Australia's superannuation system, confidence and support on which our super system relies. I can tell you that the people out there, not the people who are trying to rort the system&mdash;there are certainly some of those&mdash;but the vast majority of people, are really starting to lose confidence in the whole business of retirement because they are unable to know just what they should do when governments continually change the rules. Without that kind of public confidence, it will be impossible to encourage people to save for their own retirement because they will say, `What's the point? We start off on one basis and then, before we know it, the rules are changed and we're left stranded.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not forget that the people who will be affected by this change are those who have tried their hardest to provide for themselves in retirement and tried to lessen the load on our aged pension system. Over the past few weeks in the Senate, I have tabled a petition. When I wrote this speech a couple of weeks ago, there were 5,000 signatures. Since then, I have received another 1,500, so I have crossed it out and it is now 6,500 signatures from people calling on the government to repeal the social security legislation on this issue. I will be seeking to do just that shortly but, at this stage, I indicate that the Democrats will be supporting the opposition's amendments&mdash;that is, we will be opposing schedule 5 in its entirety.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to go over the debate that has taken place on this veterans' affairs bill because of the time. Schedule 5, which we are dealing with, does remove the exemptions from income and assets tests that apply to the superannuation and rollover funds assets of certain service pensioners and income support supplement recipients, as is explained in the explanatory memorandum. For the reasons that I gave yesterday, I am opposing this particular clause. The government now has a number of options open to it to see and realise that there is a great deal of feeling amongst the community about how this is going to operate so far as the ones who are affected are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been indicated, there are a huge number of people for whom this will be a great problem because they will have planned otherwise, on the basis of existing legislation. Persons between the ages of 55 and 65 who have lost their jobs are going to be affected by this. If their superannuation happens to be above the limits that are set in this particular legislation, they will be told that they have to dip into it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember the debate of last December. I also remember the letter from the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), or presumably from the department, and the note that I had sent around to people who raised this matter. The document put out by the Minister for Social Security and the Minister for
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5433"> Veterans' Affairs (Mr Scott) on 7 November entitled `Information on the removal of the superannuation social security means test exemption for people aged between 55 and age pension age' contains figures which, whilst implying to be pertaining to 55&hyphen; to 64&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds&mdash;I got a very strong response in respect of this&mdash;are relevant to the 65&hyphen;plus&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had a look at that document. I can see in hindsight that, if you are fully aware of what the issues are and go through the arguments, strictly speaking the document is accurate. I will read from a letter that I received from a person who was personally interested in this matter. The person said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is fact that (conveniently) the income and assets tests tables 1 and 2 (on pages 3 and 4) are the figures for aged pensioners (stuck in the middle of a document expressly referring to 55&hyphen; to 64&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds) and the mistake (perhaps  deliberate) gives the false impression that aged pensioners and 55&hyphen; to 64&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds are to be treated to identical assets test rules.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This person, who quite clearly has a deep and abiding interest in the matter, and even with his expertise in the area, felt that the statement that was issued could lead to confusion. One might say that politicians should not be confused; unfortunately, we do get confused from time to time. I am not suggesting that, in respect of anything I have asked the minister, she has not been open, honest and fulsome in her response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sad part is that we are debating this matter. We are poisoning the debate over a piece of legislation on which the minister should be congratulated and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs should be congratulated. Let me make it perfectly clear: the overwhelming provisions in this legislation are thoroughly beneficial to veterans. It is this provision, because of the time constraints, that we are focusing on at the present. I will be voting against the whole of schedule 5.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I am very disappointed with the attitude that has been taken by the committee today to schedule 5 of the veterans' affairs bill. I do not know where I
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should start. I will respond to Senator Woodley first and then move on to Senator Harradine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley, you are failing to acknowledge that superannuation is already given preferential treatment through the tax system. There is across&hyphen;party lines agreement that there should be preferential treatment for this, or that it should be treated differently&mdash;and it is treated differently in the tax system. Why would the Democrats want to continue to give preferential treatment also in the social security and veterans area?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This special treatment, as I have said before, has been available to these people since only 1993. People, especially veterans, made their investment decisions a number of years ago. So, in fact, they have not been misled. They had a period of misguided intervention by the previous government. I will give it the benefit of the doubt and believe it was trying to do the right thing by people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time that superannuation was exempted from the means test, it was believed that it would be just a modest cost to revenue. But because the financial planners had in fact found this a great opportunity to change people's investment patterns, it had become something of a rort, and, if we had not closed it in December, it would have been an enormous drain on revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge you to think very carefully before you try any measures to undo what already has been done. It is of great concern to the government. I am advised that something like $300 million over four years would be lost if the social security legislation was not maintained in the form it was passed by the Senate last December. I also emphasise that people can access their superannuation savings from age 55. That is the law; they can access it now. Why treat it as though it is inaccessible? It is available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine was talking about people losing their jobs. At this age some people are choosing to take voluntary redundancy and some people&mdash;keen fishermen amongst them&mdash;think that the idea of going fishing on and off for the last five years or so of what might be their working lives is an attractive
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5434"> proposition, if they can leave their superannuation tucked away safely and get the taxpayer to give them income support for those few years. How rational or fair is it to ask the taxpayers to be funding voluntary retirement? Superannuation is intended to provide that. If people are over the age of 55 and have the means, through superannuation, to support themselves, to the extent they are able, surely that is fair to all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is a lot of feeling from taxpayers that the revenue should be protected and that income support should be applied according to people's means, as it always has been in the Social Security Act. I would call the three years from 1993 an aberration, and a most unfortunate one, because it did open up the revenue to serious impacts. We already demonstrated in the debate last December that it was gathering momentum until that legislation was passed. I urge the Senate to think very carefully before they take a different tack now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine, I had a very great respect for your former adviser, Terry Dwyer, who was a man of infinite capacity and great experience. I think he came out of the Treasury, from memory. You were very well served by him. I think my department, but certainly my office and myself, had long discussions with him about this measure and others. I always found him very able to get on top of the detail in these areas. As I said to you a day or so ago, he was very helpful on occasions on matters that needed detailed attention. He well understood these measures. I understood that you understood them, and certainly that the document that you referred to just now was talked through with my officers and with Mr Dwyer. There was no attempt to deceive anybody. We understood that the details of that document were well understood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things you must acknowledge is that most of the people affected by last year's amendments to the Social Security Act are pensioners. Therefore, the table you were referring to about pensioners was very relevant to this whole debate. Most people are pensioners. I have some figures here in relation to the social security legislation. Only
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 18,400 allowees are estimated to be affected by that measure in 1997-98 compared to around 48,600 pensioners. Of those allowees, only 4,300 are actually on activity tested allowances. In other words, the rest are retired&mdash;they are not looking for work and they are not being required to look for work. So I am afraid that there are still obviously some severe misapprehensions around as to who is affected by that measure in social security for which we are now debating a comparable measure for veterans' affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not true that this is not a fair measure. This is a particularly fair measure. You have to recognise that, until relatively recently, superannuation has not been something that most people have; it is just in recent years that people have started to accumulate superannuation. But they have other forms of savings: they have had money in the bank, they have had shares, they have had term deposits and they have had money in their small business, as I said to you yesterday. All those forms of savings have been and still are means tested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For just over three years superannuation was not means tested. We are putting it back so that all forms of savings are treated in the social security and veterans' affairs legislation in a comparable way&mdash;fair to people who have savings, regardless of what form they take. Over time, of course, more and more Australians will have more and more of their retirement savings in the form of superannuation. We encourage that. We are happy and delighted for that to happen. That is why there is tax assistance for it, which there is not for most of the other forms of savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think you have to give careful thought as to why we should be giving preference in the social security and the veterans' affairs legislation for particular forms of savings. It is no more virtuous than any other. Why should it be accorded different and special treatment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, veterans who are already over 55 made their investment decisions many years ago. It only affects people who are below pension age and over 55 and who have received income support payments for at least 39 weeks since reaching 55. Far and away, the majority of them are already retired.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5435">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of particular interest to the committee is that the pension age for a veteran with qualifying service is five years earlier than others in the community. For a male veteran, the pension age is 60 and for a female veteran, the pension age is currently 55.5 years. To be paid a service pension before pension age, a veteran would be permanently incapacitated for work. As such, the veteran would be eligible for payment of superannuation. They would already receive the more generous assets and income test levels in most circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did emphasise in the second reading debate yesterday that exemptions from the new rules will be considered on a case by case basis where people aged between 55 and pension age are unable to access superannuation. There is not a great number of those. For example, if a partner of a service pensioner is unable to access their super at 55, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs can exempt the superannuation from the extended deeming provisions, just as I can in the social security legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The means test free areas will protect people with modest amounts of superannuation and/or rollover savings; that is, total financial investments less than $50,000 for a single pensioner or $90,000 for a couple. The taxpayer should not be required to supplement the people who have access to their superannuation but who choose not to put their superannuation to its intended use, and that is what this measure is about.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I have taken a good deal of interest in this matter and am very clear in my mind as to what I ought to do.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the light of this very strong community response and also because of what I have put on the record previously, which I really do believe in, it is appropriate for the Senate to reconsider its position on this issue as well.

The deeming rules mean that anyone with as little as $37,000 in superannuation will have their allowance reduced.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment effectively was being debated during the consideration of the previous amendment. I am very concerned that the Senate is trying to turn around, using the peg of a veterans bill&mdash;after all, we do usually have bipartisan support on veterans legislation&mdash;a bill that the veterans have being waiting on for a long time to get through the legislative logjam. This bill is of particular importance to Vietnam veterans. For the Senate to artificially use that bill as a peg with which to hang a quite different agenda in relation to superannuation means testing for all other people, not particularly veterans, is a terrible state of affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I make clear once again that the advice of my department is that the loss of revenue in the first year will be something like $90 million and it will be approaching $300 million over four years. The Senate has to think very carefully about how it is going to explain that to the Australian taxpayer. Senator Woodley is very keen to tell us that he has people signing a petition on this matter. Senator, you could get an even bigger petition if you went around asking people whether they would like income tax abolished. You should go and try that one. I am not impressed by your petition. I am impressed by the people who take the trouble to write to the minister or the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleagues in my party are not lobbying me to do something about this measure. They have found that it is fair, and that is why they are not lobbying me. You suggest that somehow they are bound by party solidarity and that they would not even come and talk to their minister, their colleague. You are wrong. That is not the way we run our party. I am very approachable. I meet with my backbench committee weekly. The party room is always ready to cross&hyphen;examine ministers thoroughly. I can assure you that your claims about my colleagues are untrue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5437">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, you are holding up a beneficial measure for veterans. Everybody has acknowledged that this rehabilitation scheme is long overdue to prevent veterans becoming welfare dependent for all their lives. The Vietnam Veterans Association in particular has seen that this is a way to help their people. This attempt to wind back a lawful decision of the Senate made only on 13 December last year is absolutely disgraceful. I can hardly find the words sufficient to express my disgust at what you are attempting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You, and Senator Harradine in particular, may well have been seen as a convenient post to lobby by those people who have a vested interest in this. I can assure Senator Harradine that I understand the pressure he is under, not just on this legislation but also on a large number of the bills that come before the parliament. I feel very sorry for him, because of the position he is in. He has this responsibility and has the pressure of the lobbyists of Australia continually beating on his door.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I say to him, as I say to the other parties, that the people that yell loudest are not the people you should be concerned about now. There is a great deal of self-interest there. What you are doing by trying to wind back the measure we passed last December is protecting millionaires. The battlers are already protected by what we have put in place and by the exemptions I have given people who cannot access their superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you should be under no misapprehension whatsoever about what you are doing. You are protecting the millionaires of Australia who have extraordinary amounts of superannuation tucked away in hollow logs. In 1993 rich people were able to move assets into roll-over funds and superannuation&mdash;very convenient. This is why there are books in this country telling people how to be millionaires and still get welfare benefits, still be entitled to the money that battlers are paying for social security income support for people who are well able to support themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is utterly disgraceful that you would contemplate doing that. It is absolutely disgraceful. The government rejects this amendment out of hand. We will not accept it and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we will make it very clear to the nation just who is responsible for delaying the veterans entitlements and putting $300 million of revenue at risk.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two matters I wish to respond to that have been raised by the minister. The first is her allegation of the delay involved in the consideration of this particular piece of legislation. I wish to emphasise again, as I did at the beginning of the second reading stage, that we are in support of the majority of this bill relating to the rehabilitation and simplification of payments to veterans. But I must remind the minister that the bills that are dealt with by this chamber are determined by the government. If there has been delay in putting forward this particularly beneficial piece of legislation, then the responsibility stops with you, Minister, and the other members of your government, because you determine the priority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the benefits to be obtained from this bill, I must say that I find it somewhat remarkable that you are essentially prepared to hold hostage a scheme such as this in order to get your own way in an area where the Senate has clearly expressed its view. I would like to indicate that at the appropriate time, if you proceed with your threat and try to hold back this bill, we will either split the bill or move the positive aspects of the bill in our name in order to avoid the callous action that you intend to visit on veterans.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to say anything more, but I think the minister's outburst has been intemperate, to say the least. To suggest that somehow or another I am bowing to the lobbyists and their self-interest, I find insulting. I have a situation in my office where I largely deal at arm's length with lobbyists. I have to say that I am aware of people who are, and will be, seriously affected by the measures that were adopted last year. This gives us an opportunity to redress that position.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Precisely. They are not millionaires&mdash;you can say that again. I think it is ludicrous for the minister to say that what we are doing is in the interests of millionaires. If she and her department are not monitoring the situation, it would be their fault, because we are not talking about lifting the amounts above that which would be an even playing field. I give you the example that is in the letter that I have tabled. I do not know this person&mdash;that is obvious&mdash;and I suggest you read the letter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the Senate that I asked Senator Sherry in December last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . why should someone with a house, plus $180,000, plus $250,000 in superannuation be regarded as eligible for welfare?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I might have answered somewhat differently from the response that Senator Sherry gave, but I thought Senator Sherry's response was quite a good one too. I now want to quote the following comments from my correspondent:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That may be a valid question where you cite the case of someone with $430,000 in monetary assets. But regarding equity, why should someone with a house, who is 65 and has elected to retire with $250,000 in superannuation, be regarded as eligible for welfare, and yet someone who is 55 to 64 and loses their job, also with $250,000 in superannuation assets, is not eligible for welfare unless their total assets, excluding house, are less than $176,000? Is this fair?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The  quote continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am assuming that the retirees referred to in the above paragraph are both married; therefore, the iniquitous anomaly is because a 65&hyphen;year&hyphen;old couple are allowed assets of $370,500 in order to be considered for eligibility for pension payments. As an example of the unfairness of the new rules, the following assumes a home owner couple with $30,000 in possessions and $250,000 in superannuation savings . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Not a millionaire, Minister&mdash;$30,000 in possessions and $250,000 built up over a lifetime. The 65&hyphen;year&hyphen;old plus gets a DSS payment of $5,064 and the person of 55 to 64 who has lost their job gets zero&mdash;nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then it goes on to what interest is accrued each year and the total received. Can that couple live on $15,000 a year? I do not know
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> how people manage. The bottom line is that the person who has lost the job, that couple, is discriminated against to the tune of $192 a fortnight. We are not talking about millionaires. We are talking about, I believe, equity and fairness. I am not going over the subject again. I have thought about this deeply and I do believe that, in a period of unemployment&mdash;it is different from last December; things are worse at the moment&mdash;you have to have regard for these people that are losing their jobs. They are not millionaires.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to have regard for them, when they are losing jobs at age 55 to 64, because they find it very difficult to get back into the paid work force. Indeed, as I said yesterday, I believe that rather than doing this sort of negative thing, the government ought to be encouraging persons to retire early. Give them some incentive to retire earlier so as to relieve those who desire to do so and to relieve pressure on the work force. But no, the government is going the other way around. It is giving bonuses to those who are fortunate to be able to choose to work till they are 70 years of age.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not stupid, Senator Newman. If you were concerned about millionaires, you would have supported us last year in inserting the cap of $250,000. Now, $250,000 sounds like a lot of money, but what does it mean in reality if converted to a pension? What it means, at today's interest rates, is that if you go and purchase with your $250,000 an annuity for life you will get approximately $15,000 to $17,000 a year. That is what that converts into. Last year, Labor thought that seemed to be a reasonable figure to establish a cut&hyphen;off point at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to assure the Senate&mdash;and to agree with Senator Harradine and Senator Woodley&mdash;that Labor has taken a consistent position, for the reasons we have outlined, that the many tens of thousands of people to be affected by this draconian measure, this vicious measure, workers who have built up over a long period, voluntarily in many cases, a reasonable superannuation asset to live on when they retire, have had the goalposts changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is grossly unfair and grossly inequitable. You are attempting to blackmail us&mdash;and that is what it is&mdash;by saying that there are some good measures in respect to veterans, which there are, and that unless we cop tens of thousands of Australians being deemed on their superannuation you are going to go and argue that the veterans are to blame for the provisions in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already said that we will come back here and take up the good measures of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the legislation and we will move them when the Senate next sits. We will date them from your operative date. I can assure you that if you front up in front of veterans and put your position, we will put our position about saving them from the deeming of superannuation. I think I know what argument will win the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has been quite consistent on this issue. We are determined to save the many tens of thousands of workers in this country from this dreadful and vicious deeming provision&mdash;it is absolutely vicious. There will be at least 1,000 people in Tasmania affected by it.

I would not want Senator Harradine to think I was attacking him when I made the comments about the pressure; it was in sympathy for the pressure that an Independent's office must suffer because they are the focus of attention on all legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me point out to the committee that the average superannuation holding of Australians, as Senator Sherry has pointed out over and over again, is $38,000. These people are not affected at all. It would be a terrible misrepresentation to be suggesting that people's superannuation is vulnerable. It is people with substantial superannuation who will be affected. They do not have to be millionaires, but they are pretty well off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the three years that you opened the door since 1993, when the Labor Party changed the rules, the financial planners jumped onto this. Their customers, their clients, would have been mad not to take up the opportunity. Perhaps, Senator Sherry, you have not seen the books that are about now and the ads for the books urging people how to get superannuation entitlements and still have masses of assets. You did that and it is because of that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5440"> that the cost to revenue of what you are proposing is going to be so great.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may not be a lot of rich people in Tasmania, but if you were right&mdash;and you do not know any more than I can say&mdash;that there would be 1,000 people affected in Tasmania, there would be 1,000 people with substantial assets. Most people are around the average of $38,000. So let us not be under any misapprehension about what is happening here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You mentioned the $250,000 cap that you were proposing last year.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Schedule 11&mdash;Amendment of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Further Budget and Other Measures) Act 1996 relating to rent assistance for single persons sharing accommodation</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Repeal the Schedule.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have had this debate on many occasions, and it was the subject of extensive investigation and inquiry by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee. Essentially the proposition that was put by the government was that single persons living in shared accommodation should receive a lower level of rental assistance than those who are not living in shared accommodation. As I have stated on many occasions before, that whole provision, in our view, is based on a false premise that those single persons living in shared accommodation essentially can incur a lower cost of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be that some people who are sharing accommodation do have reduced costs of things like food, groceries and household effects, but I have to say that it is certainly not the case on every occasion. But even for those people who do reduce their living expenses, it should not have the effect of reducing their rental assistance because very clearly the rental assistance is designed towards and directed at assisting with the cost of rent, not assisting with the cost of those other living expenses. So it is really extraordinarily unfair for the government to put forward this provision that will reduce the amount of assistance they will receive with their rent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the rather interesting facts that the Senate Community Affairs References Committee found in its inquiry was that the two groups that were most affected were the very young and the very old. Dealing first with the very young, they were generally people between the ages of 16 and 18. They were not at home and were on social security seeking work, or they were employed, but because of the small amount of money that a lot of the people in that age group are paid&mdash;they are the working poor&mdash;they had been, to date at least, receiving some rent assistance. These people, the youngest, those in the most dire situations with the least support&mdash;the children
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5442"> trying to struggle on and support themselves&mdash;are going to be affected by this proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second group that is affected is the elderly, in particular elderly women who have either never married or who have survived their husbands&mdash;women do tend to survive longer than men. They live alone and may, for company, companionship or security, be sharing with another older woman. This amendment removes this rent assistance for those in shared accommodation and has the effect of making the provision relating to those on social security consistent with the changes that we have already made in relation to veterans' affairs. It is a proposition that is consistent with what we put in December last year. It creates consistency among those in receipt of benefits across the spectrum. I commend the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a particular problem raised on the last occasion, when Senator Newman conceded that rent assistance should not apply to single people sharing who receive the carer or disability support pension. Maybe the minister could inform us whether, under the current legislation, people on a carer or disability support pension also receiving rental assistance would be affected by the government's proposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important that I quickly put on the record that I am advised that if this amendment was successful it would mean a loss to revenue of a further $110 million over the next four years. If you put that with the $300 million loss to revenue of the measure that was passed by the chamber before, we are talking about $410 million lost to revenue over four years on measures that were passed by this chamber in December&mdash;at a time when this government, having inherited a financial mess in the country, is trying its utmost to restore the national accounts and get this country out of its indebtedness. So it would be a terrible effort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I also point out that under the current rates the combined maximum rate for two single sharers will be $49.80 a week compared to only $35.20 for a couple. Currently, two sharers can receive up to $74.60 a week compared to only $35.20 for a couple. It is not an inequitable measure; it is a perfectly fair measure. I urge the committee to reject the amendment utterly.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I am sure Senator Newman understands, a couple sharing together generally share the same bedroom and therefore have to pay rent for only one room. Two single people who are renting have to have accommodation that provides one room each.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introduction</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Tax Laws Amendment Bill No 1 is an omnibus Bill of some ten mostly unrelated changes, to the Income Tax Assessment Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In what is becoming a hall mark of this Government, any time they engage in amendment to the Tax Act it is a case of shove as many amendments or additions as is possible into the one omnibus bill and hope that the Senate doesn't disagree whether any aspect of those separate changes so that the Bill can pass.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5444">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As my colleague Mr Latham said in the House, grouping so many different changes together is `folly' and the Government should be aware that the Opposition is wary of this piecemeal approach to tax reform that the Government is engaging in.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This being said the Opposition will be supporting most aspects of the Bill with reservations that are outlined in the second reading amendment to the Bill that Senators should now have before them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would now like to comment those concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Trading Ships Depreciation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, the Opposition is opposed to the Governments decision to bring forward the end of accelerated depreciation available on trading ships from the year 2002 to 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This proposal which is contingent upon the disastrous decision to terminate the ships capital grants provisions will massively increase the costs facing Australian shippers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For Australia to actively increase the costs of international shipping is ludicrous policy when it acts against our long term interests as a major trading nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor opposed the premature ending of the capital grants scheme and we similarly oppose the restriction of accelerated depreciation contained in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When coupled with the Governments original intention to end the ship building bounty at the end of this year, we have clear demonstration of the Governments total disregard for the Australian ship building industry and the devastation the Governments policies would have had on the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While Australia's international competitors in the ship building enjoy far more significant government support than Australian ship builders, this Government is intent on making it as hard as possible for both investment and expansion of Australia's industry to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why is this Government against Australia's ship building industry ?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why is the Government so intent on ensuring that Australia's ship builders ability to compete internationally against subsided international ship builders is destroyed ?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">May be the Minister would like to answer those questions and explain to Australian ship builders and in particular workers in that industry why his Government is so intent on seeing them out of a job.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This being said the Opposition will be voting against the proposal as contained in schedule 1, part 1 of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employee Share Ownership Schemes</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would now like to turn to the issue of employee share schemes.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government proposal will see the invitation threshold for employee share schemes reduced from 75% of `employees' to 66% of `permanent employees'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure therefore in effect contains two changes in one. Firstly the reduction in the number of employees who can participate from 75% to 66%, and secondly a change in eligible employees from `employees' to `permanent employees'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition will therefore be opposing the change in the threshold, we see no logic or reason why there should be a reduction in the eligibility threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are also surprised that the Government would introduce such an amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If anything I would have thought this Government would want to encourage employee share ownership and in particular encourage investment by Australian workers in Australian companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note the comments by Senator Short the former Assistant Treasurer and avid share market investor as we all know.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said in this place on the 13 February:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am very proud to hold shares in several major Australian companies. Australia is crying out for productive investment. Shares are a critically important vehicle for such investment, and I am proud to be playing at least a small part.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why then is the Government trying to restrict Australian workers from share ownership ?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The former Assistant Treasurer is an avid supporter of share ownership, as we all know, so why is the Government trying to deny Australian workers their opportunity to become shareholders, or is this only a privilege the</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government believes belongs to the top end of town, which it is increasingly becoming a captive of.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other part of this change would appear technical in nature but none the less the Opposition would appreciate an explanation of why there is need to change from `employees' to `permanent employees' as the only ones who will be eligible to participate in the employee ownership scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opposition would appreciate if the Minister could explain what the difference is. why is their a need for this change ? And what is the definition of permanent employee for the purposes of this section.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other major change contained in this section increases the amount by which an employee who acquires shares under an employee ownership scheme to claim an exemption from tax. This  amount has increased from $500 to $1000, and applies to the discount received on the purchase of the shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, it allows employers to claim a tax deduction of up to $1000 on the discount provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition has no objection to this proposal, but does find it strange that at the same time the Government is reducing both the eligibility threshold and the category
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5445"> of employee who is eligible to take part in an employee share ownership scheme, it simultaneously increases the tax concession from $500 to $1000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of this, as previously stated the Opposition opposes the reduction in the eligibility threshold and will be moving a amendment to this effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition will not be opposing the increase in the tax concession amount from $500 to $1000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CGT Small Business Rollover Relief</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last issue I wish to speak on is that of the small business CGT rollover relief.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before I start the substance of my comments I would like to congratulate the Government on keeping at least one promise amongst the hundreds they have broken by introducing the CGT rollover relief for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CGT rollover relief as contained in the provisions of Schedule 5 of this Bill are really the central focus of this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure coupled with the announcement that roll over relief would be extended to the sale of shares in a business amounts to a $315m in forgone revenue in a full year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not an insignificant amount of money and given that over a 4 year period it amounts to over $1 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition believes the Australian community deserve something in return for this loss of revenue considering it could be put to a host of other policy initiatives, such as labour market programs, legal aid, education funding and the reinstatement of the Commonwealth dental health scheme, just to name a few.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a minimum and in essence, as a quid pro quo for Australian taxpayers essentially handing back to small business over a billion dollars in foregone revenue, small business should be required to ensure a net increase in employment when such rollover relief is claimed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this end the Opposition has announced amendments to this Bill to achieve that outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our amendments will see rollover relief become a reward to those small businesses that have increased employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small business will have to satisfy one of two tests in order to claim the small business rollover relief.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first test will be that a small business will have to have increased the average number of full time employees by at least 10% during the twelve month period following the acquisition of a new business relative to the 12 month period of the business that has been sold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second test under our proposal will allow rollover relief to be claimed in instances where the business has increased its payroll by at least 10% on the same basis as I have just outlined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We in the Opposition believe these amendments to be fair and reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Governments proposal as it currently stands small business stands to gain over one $1 billion in tax
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> relief and there is no commitment to provide one new job, NOT ONE.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore these amendments will give credence to the Prime Ministers rhetoric of using small business as the engine room of economic growth and thus employment growth. If the PM and the Government are committed to employment growth then they will embrace these amendments and support them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that the government is about to fuel that engine room with over $1 billion in tax relief, then surely employment generation should be the focus, and it is the Governments duty to ensure that job creation is the focus of this very generous tax relief.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have said that any tax reform proposal should have to pass three tests one of which is, and I quote `It must generate more employment.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transfer of over $1 billion from the public sector to the private sector is by the Oppositions reckoning a major tax reform proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Prime Minister and Treasurer are serious, then the Government will support these amendments. If they do not to support them, then the Prime Ministers statement was nothing more than hollow rhetoric and his commitment to Australia's unemployed will be shown to be a cruel hoax and this provision of the Bill nothing more than an expensive exercise in pork barrelling in order to try and shore up its crumbling support in the small business community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As my colleague in the other place Mr Latham essentially stated, whenever the business sector enjoys benefits from the public sector, there is a need for them to ensure a socially responsible outcome, these amendments ensure that outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such an outcome we in the Opposition believe is achieved by these amendments which ensure the business sector has to be committed to increasing net employment if they are going to receive over $1 billion in taxpayer funds.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reality is there is always a large cost to the public sector in any form of business tax relief. The CGT rollover relief is certainly a large cost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This cost represents an opportunity cost to the public sector and a very large one at that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Prime Minister has made much of the need for the unemployed to accept a social responsibility when in receipt of the dole, through his announced work for the dole scheme, this same principle can apply to the small business sector that is in receipt of government assistance through $1 billion in tax relief.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They too have a social responsibility to put something back into the Australian community. Providing jobs for our young people in particular is but a small request for over $1 billion in tax relief.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5446"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The notion of reciprocal responsibilities should not be the exclusive preserve of the social welfare sector, which is what the Prime Ministers work for the dole scheme attempts to entrench in the public mind.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why shouldn't the concept of business assistance through the CGT roll over relief amounting to over $1 billion over four years also carry the reciprocal responsibility of job creation as our amendments propose ?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the challenge for both the small business sector and in particular the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Threat to the tax base</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under this bill as it currently stands we believe the Government is just adding to the number of threats our tax base already faces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Crisis Couriers case and its implications is but one example of the constant attacks being made on the integrity of the tax base.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is notable that in the face of such threats this Government is prepared to do nothing, accept mouth platitudes about the need to stamp out rorting by the rich.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But when the previous Labor Govt identified up to $800m in revenue as being at risk due to high wealth individuals using complex trust tax arrangements, this Govt when in Opposition scoffed at the suggestion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And why wouldn't they, because they would hardly want to upset their rich rorting Liberal mates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its the `Bottom of the Harbour' all over again being fed and encouraged by this Government's complacency and lack of commitment to stamp out tax rorting. This should come as no surprise though, given that at the time of the `Bottom of the Harbour schemes' who was the Treasurer in charge at the time, doing nothing, no one less than the present Prime Minister Mr Howard. He did nothing then and he continues to do nothing now, because its not in the interests of the Liberal party to upset their Liberal mates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When you put the Governments complacency together with advances in such things as information technology and the explosion in electronic commerce it should be evident to the Govt that now more than ever they need to be increasingly vigilance to ensure that the structural integrity of the tax base is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have no doubt that electronic commerce poses one of the biggest threats of our time to the revenue base of national Governments around the world, and it therefore causes me concern when measures such as the one before us have the very real possibility of eroding the integrity of the tax base, at a time when Governments need to prevent such erosion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would be interested to hear the Governments opinion on this matter and whether they believe in the absence of these amendments which put the rollover relief to towards a positive measure in the form of employment generation, will their bill as it stands open up the possibility of widespread rorting, not by small business but by the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> creative accountants and lawyers who I am sure are champing at the bit to see what sort of schemes and arrangements they can devise in order to circumvent the actual intent of the legislation. r</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also concerns the Opposition that in the absence of a reciprocal obligation on the part of business to provide employment through the use of the tax relief as is the intention of the Oppositions amendments, the Government is giving a tax break to some who are already independently wealthy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular I make reference to an answer given by the Assistant Treasurer to a question on notice I posed to him on the 12 December.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will taxpayers with non-business wealth (such as an art collection) worth many millions of dollars be eligible for CGT rollover relief if their net business assets are less than $5 million?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Governments answer was this:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will provide Capital Gains Tax (CGT) rollover relief to small and medium sized enterprises. To be eligible for rollover relief taxpayers must satisfy a number of tests, including that the net value of the taxpayer's assets must not exceed $5 million.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of meeting this test, an `asset' does not include, where the taxpayer is an individual who is not acting as a trustee, an asset for the personal use and enjoyment of the individual or an associate of the individual.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, if an individual has an expensive antique or an art collection which is kept for the individual's personal use and enjoyment, then it  will not be taken into account in determining whether the $5 million threshold is satisfied. The taxpayer will `not be eligible for rollover relief on disposal of items from the antique or art collection, as these items are not active assets in the taxpayer's business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of this response from the Government the Opposition have also announced that it will be moving an amendment to ensure that such personal use items are included for the purposes of calculating the net asset value of the employer taxpayer. Why should someone with an art collection or antique collection in effect be subsidised by Australian battlers through being able to claim CGT rollover relief ?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why shouldn't Australia's battlers be confident that if they are going to forego over $1 billion in tax revenue then their children should at least have the opportunity of a job rather than have the recipient of that tax relief add another Ming vase to their collection ?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Governments proposal it will be possible for individuals who are independently wealthy in their our right and have significant accumulated wealth by virtue of their business interests to access the CGT rollover relief. We do not believe this to be fair and this amend
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5447"> ment goes some way to introducing some equity as to who qualifies for relief.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Government is going to oppose this measure I would like the Minister to explain where is the social equity for Australia's battlers in extending CGT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">rollover relief to individuals when they have significant personal wealth such as an art collection, an antique collection or share portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wouldn't it be more appropriate for that individual to divest themselves of some of their personal wealth and use that to expand their business rather than rely on taxpayers ?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxpayers should not be called upon to fund such an expansion just to allow someone to continue the hang the Monet in the Toorak mansion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final amendment to the measure the Opposition has announced is that the ATO is to monitor the amount of relief that is actually claimed and give some indication on how it has been utilised. This information is to be included in the Commissioners annual report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With those comments in I look forward to the Governments positive response to the proposals we have put forward.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth Education or Training Payments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would finally add that the Opposition also has some concerns with schedule two of the Bill pertaining to the treatment of commonwealth education or training payments and that my colleague Senator Carr will be outlining these concerns and some amendments he plans to move on behalf of the Opposition in regards to these concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion I reiterate the Oppositions position on this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition opposes the end of accelerated depreciation available on trading ships from the year 2002 to 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We oppose the reduction in the invitation threshold for employee share schemes reduced from 75% of `employees' to 66% of `permanent employees' and will be moving amendments to this effect accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition will be seeking to amend the CGT small business roll over relief provisions, as we believe the Government should ensure that the tax foregone and put back into the hands small business should be used to ensure a net increase in employment by small business. As small business will save over $1 billion in Capital Gains Tax over four years, a commitment to increase employment particularly for Australia's young unemployed, the Opposition believes is not too much ask.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition will seek to move some amendments relating to schedule two of the Bill as will be outlined by Senator Carr.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition will be supporting the other provisions of the Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill is the latest in the four or five updates of the tax laws that we find ourselves considering, usually on the last day of each session. It contains a number of measures, most of which are not controversial, including streamlined rules for determining majority underlying interests in public companies, unit trusts and insurance mutuals; changes to franking rules to both class C and clause A franking credits; and technical amendments to  foreign income, commercial debt forgiveness rules, tax file number provisions, and provisions relating to equity investments in small and medium sized business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also seeks to remove special accelerated depreciation rules for new ships introduced by the previous government and worth $40 million over the next three years. These provisions were originally introduced, along with ships capital grants, to reduce the age of the Australian shipping fleet and, it was said, thus increase its efficiency. The ships capital grants scheme was repealed by the government earlier this year and, while the Democrats opposed that repeal, the legislation passed the Senate with the support of the two Independents. The repeal of the ships capital grants scheme has rendered the depreciation provisions all but unworkable and there is little point in retaining the provisions in the Tax Act. Even though we disagree with the underlying policy we will not oppose the repeal of the depreciation provisions as that issue has already been lost with the earlier bill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5449">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also seeks to clarify the definition of which Commonwealth education and training payments are excluded from assessable income. This is an issue the Democrats have been tracking for many years, and my colleague Senator Stott Despoja will be speaking on that matter later and moving an amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also implements the government's election commitments to increase the income tax exemption for employee share plan benefits from $500 a year to $1,000 a year. The Democrats have long been supporters of employee share plans which are made widely available to all employees, and we will support this initiative. The argument in favour of increasing participation in employee share plans is twofold. First, it can increase worker productivity because it gives employees a sense of ownership in the company and, second, employee share plans can help raise national savings by encouraging an employer sponsored savings mentality at the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The modelling of savings expert Dr Vince FitzGerald estimates that this encouragement of better savings behaviour at the workplace could increase the national savings ratio by up to 0.5 per cent of GDP. However, these benefits will only be available if the employee share plans are broadly based. Providing generous tax concessions, particularly by exempting up to $1,000 of income from taxation, could create a massive benefit for high income earners with access to salary packaging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When most companies talk about employee share plans they are talking about their executive option plans where thousands of dollars of shares are given to senior executives for as little as 2c in the dollar. The Democrats do not want to provide any additional incentives for share plans which are not available to all workers. We believe that, to maximise the productivity effect and the savings effect to encourage the level of worker participation in employee share savings, plans must be available to all employees on the same terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For this reason, in 1995, we supported legislation which set strict criteria for an improved employee share plan. These criteria
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were that the plan must be made available to at least three&hyphen;quarters of all employees and that it should be offered on basically the same terms to all. We think that is fair and reasonable. As I said, we do not think this should be able to be manipulated into a generous scheme for senior highly paid employees and a less generous scheme for the rest of the workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the amendments in this bill seek to allow less fair share plans through the net. They seek to reduce the requirement that a scheme be offered to three&hyphen;quarters of all employees to a much narrower requirement of two&hyphen;thirds of permanent employees. The `permanent' means that this would allow the exclusion of virtually all of the blue collar work force from most share plans, because of the scaling down, as well as the growing proportion of employees on term contracts or on a permanent casual basis. So we oppose those amendments, as I said, for the reasons that we think the benefit should be offered as widely as possible, not to the favoured few.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big ticket item in this bill is the introduction of capital gains tax rollover relief for small business. This measure, costing up to  $200 million a year, was a key election commitment of both the Democrats and the coalition, and we welcomed it. Under the government's proposal as it currently stands the rollover relief is available only if the taxpayer's assets do not exceed $5 million. Five million dollars is a huge amount of assets. I would have preferred to have seen a much lower threshold used, as this too would have reduced the cost of the measure. A $5 million threshold means that this benefit will be available not just to small business but to a lot of medium and large sized businesses as well, because, assuming a return on assets of six to eight per cent, that amounts to assets representing an annual income of $300,000 to $400,000 a year, which is hardly your struggling corner store, or even a family farm. As a targeting measure, we believe that the government should have included personal assets in the determination of whether a small business person has net assets of $5 million and is thus eligible for this rollover relief. The Labor Party has foreshadowed amend
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5450"> ments on this issue and we will be supporting them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other respects the government's proposals were not anywhere near as generous as they should have been. The original proposal would have required the taxpayer to purchase like assets to replace the earlier asset. It would also have excluded sale of shares in the family company, insisting that the underlying assets be sold with complicated stamp duty consequences if the company sold as well. These aspects were much criticised by my colleague Senator Andrew Murray, through the Senate committees, and those concerns were put directly to the government, as they were by Mr Peter Andren MP in the other place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On two occasions the government moved to amend its own legislation. This bill and the one we are going to debate later today, Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997, reflect these amendments, some of which were announced in the government's response to the Bell report earlier this year. The Democrats welcome those additional concessions, but we do say they were pretty grudgingly and belatedly extended and do call into question a kind of qualified commitment of this government to the small business sector. We think a government truly committed to reducing the tax burden of compliance of small business would have comprehensively addressed not just capital gains tax but the collection of wholesale sales tax and fringe benefits tax as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate small business taxation committee inquiry report, which was a Democrat initiative in 1995, recommended a range of such needed reforms, many of which were then recommended also by the Prime Minister's deregulation task force, headed by Mr Charlie Bell. The government has not taken these issues forward. I wait to see whether it is going to in the future. Like the development of the capital gains tax rollover relief, the few concessions that have been made we think have been made under heavy pressure from the small business lobby.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will continue to pursue broader taxation relief for small business, which still faces
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> average tax compliance costs two to three times those of larger business&mdash;compliance costs that are likely to increase, many say, rather than reduce if a GST is introduced. We will continue to push for further reform of small business taxes to reduce those compliance costs, seeking to ensure that the government does not use any diversionary debate about tax reform&mdash;code for a GST&mdash;to avoid its obligations to correct flaws and compliance costs in the tax code as it presently stands.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The main issue of contention in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 is the treatment of scholarships and the associated issue of a draft Australian Taxation Office ruling regarding current paragraph 23(z)(i) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The majority of my comments will focus on this issue, but as briefly as I can I would like to comment on a few other issues in this omnibus bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill includes changes relating to the treatment of capital gains tax in a number of areas, including small and medium business, and the treatment of employee share schemes and dividend imputations. The contentious bits are a reduction of the criteria under which  tax benefits are given to employee share schemes and the potential opening of capital gains tax rollovers to rorts by companies that may be part of tax minimisation structures by the wealthy. I will address these issues in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also items on dividend imputation. The education issue is the major debate and as a result we have not put to the Senate this time a proposal to decrease dividend imputation to 50 per cent. I want to flag that we will put the measure up again in future&mdash;a measure which will increase revenue by around $700 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also includes a measure to extinguish the special depreciation on trading ships. We have an amendment designed to oppose this. We have done this because we support, as we always have, shipping and rail, despite what the government have often tried to do to the contrary. We see measure after measure targeting these industries, and we will oppose them. Further, we specifically
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5451"> believe it is important that Australia not be dependent upon foreign flag shipping for its transport needs in this sector. It is a dumb thing to do as a country. We think this is one sector that should get support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On education, this bill includes what is supposedly a technical amendment to eliminate a long list of acts and replace it with the generic term `Commonwealth education or training payments', CETPs. The problem that arises is that there is some implication that this generic term includes Commonwealth tertiary scholarships. There are at least two proposed clauses that specifically imply scholarships are included. Every party here now, including the government, has put forward amendments to knock these two clauses out. The Greens, the Democrats and the government have put forward an amendment to ensure that scholarships are excluded from the definition of CETPs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more contentious issue the non-government parties are trying to address is the Australian Taxation Office ruling in relation to paragraph 23(z)(i) of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Subsection 23(z) quite simply says that scholarships or bursaries for `a student receiving full-time education at a school, college or university' are tax exempt. It then includes a list of exemptions, mainly exemptions relating to Commonwealth education programs like Austudy and Abstudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the tricky part is paragraph 23(z)(i) which says that a scholarship is taxable if a student gets the scholarship `upon condition that the student will (or will, if required) render, or continue to render, services to that person or authority'. The devil here is in the definition of what a service is. The concept of rendering services is interpreted widely so many students, particularly in the sciences, will be seen as rendering services and be taxed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a problem here in relation to the way we are funding education. I do not believe that this should be used as a means of attacking students when universities in the end are being required by government to get funding from elsewhere. In some cases, we will find that students are effectively told that, if they do applied science research or study in a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cooperative research centre, their scholarship will be taxed. Yet if they do a degree in anthropology, drama or medicine, it will not be. The difference to the student might be something like $2,500 a year. So you might be penalising students in applied science or engineering and creating an incentive-disincentive system favouring degrees that are not industry relevant. This is on top of HECS and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The premise by the Australian Taxation Office is that scholarships are effectively work for pay. If that were the case, then you would expect people to have all the other bits that go with working&mdash;superannuation, insurance and proper conditions. But that is not the case. What about industrial award status? No, that is not the case. They do not get overtime or superannuation contributions and they do not come under occupational health and safety. You cannot have it both ways. If it is a way of extracting money from students, who often do not have much choice, that is not the way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we have all been trying to ensure that real scholarships are protected while addressing the situation of commercial interests fundamentally exploiting the system and  ensuring that they do not get benefits. Often those commercial interests try to get students to do their research cheaply, largely subsidised by, I would say, universities and taxpayers alike. It is a problem and has not been easy. There will be amendments dealing with this in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen government programs explicitly set up organisations such as cooperative research centres to produce research that the government has targeted as commercially valuable. It is a case of continuing the history of trying to pick winners in technical development. It is seen, in part, as an extension of the old technology development grants, but these are explicitly part of the university system. We would like to see that those cooperative research centres are not targeted for worse treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see that there has been more of a push to privatise universities. It worked. University funding has been cut, and research funding has been cut or tied to commercialisation.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5452"> Universities found that they could make up the difference by getting external funding. That is the way we have ended up going. We have ended up with a market system rather than one that is producing good academic outcomes and good research outcomes, being able to share information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were also issues in relation to intellectual property, and I will be dealing with those when we deal with amendments. Governments have pushed universities towards commercialism to the point that now most education, especially in the sciences and in the engineering field, is in the service of corporate profit, and almost any degree is likely to be of benefit to the private sector. Government, both Labor and Liberal, did this and fought for this. If the dividing line between education and commercial service is now a great murky swamp, a grey area, it is certainly not the students&mdash;the young people who have shown academic excellence and a willingness to work&mdash;who should be getting it in the neck. So that is what we will be trying to address in the amendments as they come into this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am speaking on this bill in relation to its impact on education. We are dealing here with what is essentially a very simple issue: whether we, as a nation, want to encourage post&hyphen;graduate research, to improve links between industry and research training, and to maintain and build on our international research reputation. This bill claims that it seeks to maintain existing law. The ALP amendments seek to ensure that this parliament maintains the existing practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Income Tax Assessment Act states that scholarships are tax exempt, except where the recipient is required to `render a service' to the scholarship provider. Although this is a legal provision of longstanding application, the practice has been that post&hyphen;graduate scholarships have not been subject to tax. In other words, the `rendering services' test has not been rigorously applied by the Tax Office in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1994, the Tax Office took steps preparatory to enforcing the `rendering a service' provision. It issued a draft tax ruling which sought to define `rendering a service'. This would have forced every recipient to apply to the Tax Office in order to determine whether or not their scholarship was exempt&mdash;hardly an incentive for the provision of research scholarships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initial Draft Ruling provided a list of the sorts of activities which would be considered by the Tax Office as `services rendered'. According to the Draft Ruling, simply acknowledging the scholarship  provider in a report or publication of results would be considered to be rendering a service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ALP believes that was an unreasonable interpretation. Over and above that, however, we believe that to try to determine the tax status of a scholarship on this basis is a flawed approach, doing nothing but creating concern and confusion among the very people we want to be involved in important research work. If the Draft Ruling were implemented, these people would be bogged down in ongoing debates with the Tax Office about whether or not they were `rendering a service' for the receipt of their scholarship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After detailed consultations with the relevant parts of the education sector, the ALP has decided that the `rendering a service' provision should be removed, to make it clear that genuine scholarships should be tax exempt, without the need for any further justification. We believe that the way the system has been effectively operating for some years, with the `services rendered' provision not being enforced, or not in any serious or systematic way, is a good indication of the soundness of this approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not believe that a definition of scholarship needs to be enshrined in the law. We feel that, in this case, definitions are likely to place unforeseen limits on what will be judged to be a scholarship. And, given that this is a very simple issue, as I have already said, about encouraging research scholarships, then we ought to be seeking the broadest possible definition. On one hand, the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5453"> revenue estimated from this measure is $6 million per annum. On the other, there is a real possibility of damage to national research effort.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Tax Office view was implemented there would be a further disincentive for low income earners without private means to undertake post&hyphen;graduate study. This would disadvantage those who rely upon scholarships to support themselves. It has to be remembered this is all the more significant for post&hyphen;graduate students with dependants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further attacks on equitable access to higher education, building upon the assault in last year's budget increases in HECS, which included acceleration of HECS repayments and the introduction of full fees for undergraduates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not believe that the amendment circulated by Senator Stott Despoja is necessary. The Tax Office has already indicated in its draft rulings that it does not believe that payments received by a student in his or her capacity as an employee rather than as a student are by way of qualifying as a scholarship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has also indicated that it considers a scholarship to be a grant made primarily for the education of the student.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We think that is entirely reasonable. We believe that, where this Parliament needs to give guidance is not on the question of what constitutes a scholarship but on the issue of rendering a service. We think that it needs to be made crystal clear that this is not a valid test of whether or not a payment is to be considered a scholarship. Under those circumstances, the best way to achieve this is simply to strike out the paragraph.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where does the Government stand in all this?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Higher Education Funding Report for the 1997&hyphen;99 Triennium, put out in the name of the Minister, Senator Vanstone, contains the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The Government stated in its pre&hyphen;election higher education policy statement that it desires to attract industry support for post&hyphen;graduate research scholarships. However, the Government is concerned at suggestions that such scholarships might be taxable and is aware of the need to clarify the tax status of industry linked post&hyphen;graduate research scholarships. Options for taxation treatment of these scholarships are currently being considered'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, Minister, what is the result of the Government's considerations? What action will you be taking to ensure that post&hyphen;graduate research scholarships are not taxed and research is encouraged?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment you have circulated does not do this. It does not address the substantive issue, that is, the tax status of post&hyphen;graduate scholarships which are likely to be caught by the `rendering a service' provision.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it does not, we know what that means. It means that, yet again, Senator Vanstone has let the bean counters win. She has let them jeopardise the future of this country for short&hyphen;term so&hyphen;called `savings' for which we or our children will pay the real price in years to come. That price will higher than any sums which she, as Minister against Education, has offered up on the altar of slash and burn government, as substantial as those sums have been. That price will be downgraded universities, poorer quality education, reduced access for all but the wealthy, a run&hyphen;down national research effort, and a generation of young people ill&hyphen;equipped to take their place in the new workplace and society.</PARA>

The benefits can be in art work, new ideas, a new angle to an old theme or an achievement, and the list of possibilities goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of the taxing provision provides an interesting insight into what the scholarship exemption was supposed to achieve. In 1950, the Spooner committee reported to the Treasurer at the time, the Rt Hon. A.W. Fadden. The terms of reference of the committee were to examine the desirability of exempting scholarship income from taxation. At the time, England and New Zealand exempted scholarships from tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee concluded that payments in the form of `awards to enable students to pursue a course of study' should be exempt, while payments in the nature of remuneration for present and future services and living allowances should be taxed. The committee proposed an amendment to section 23 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, and the words they suggested are informative.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since that time, the education sector has undergone considerable change. The attacks by both the former government and the current government on the sector are, I think,

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also consulted with people in the industry sector who say that imposing a tax will increase their administrative costs with more paperwork, and provide a disincentive to further education upon which they rely to carry out their businesses. The government, they believe, is actively trying to encourage greater participation by industry in research. Through scholarships, industry can contribute to education as well as assist in the collaboration the government talks about. The message industry gets from taxing scholarships, however, is yet another kick after the 150 per cent rebate cut to 125 per cent and the cuts to the research and development budget. Further slugging the income of computer scientists or geologists will affect their desire to carry on their studies. The differences between an employee's income and that of a student is already considerable, but a further cut will bring them really close to poverty conditions.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conclude the second reading debate, many of the provisions in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill No. 1 1997 implement the government's central election commitment to small business to provide capital gains tax rollover relief for the disposal of active assets used by small business.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> depreciation. It is associated with a previous ALP scheme for accelerated depreciation on ships qualifying under the Ships (Capital Grants) Act or SCG. It was modified last year and this bill adjusts the date of tax concessions to correspond with the delivery date set out in the Ships (Capital Grants) Act as amended in December last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims that this is just a technical change and it will have no effect. In that case, it equally does not have to be changed. In fact, by our reading of it the eligibility is tied to the criteria under the SCG Act and is not dependent on receiving a capital grant under the act. Specific measures under paragraph 57AM(4)(d) determine the eligibility of post&hyphen;1982 ships that are not  grants act ships. Eligibility under (4)(d) is based on staffing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is simply being disingenuous. What it seems to want to do is extinguish the possibility that accelerated depreciation for eligible ships that are not grants act ships can be paid after the date a ship could qualify as a grants act ship. Any ship that would have qualified for a grant under the grants act would still qualify under (4)(d) as an eligible ship for the purposes of depreciation. It seems that this government wants to make sure no ship using good technology to reduce staffing levels safely gets any benefits at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is disgraceful. It perpetuates the bias of this government against ships of all sorts whether public or private, new or old. The bounty was maintained and I believe this proposal is designed to ensure staffing levels are reduced without reducing appropriate standards for safety, and crew welfare should also be maintained. The grants are now gone, but the accelerated depreciation remains and should remain until it runs its course.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment to section 57AM enables those ships that would have qualified for the capital grant had the scheme continued for a further 12 months until 30 June 1997 to still qualify for the accelerated depreciation concession. This is provided these ships continue to meet the compliance criteria set out in the Ships (Capital Grants) Act and are delivered to the shipowner and registered in Australia before 1 July 1997. The Australian taxpayer cannot be expected to continue pouring depreciation concessions into the shipping industry when it has failed to address the serious problems impeding this industry's development as an efficient and competitive world class industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to draw the attention of the chamber to another issue in the explanatory memorandum in relation to special depreciation on trading ships. It has been stated that the estimated revenue savings of the measure will be $10 million in 1997&hyphen;98, $15 million in 1998&hyphen;99 and $15 million 1999&hyphen;2000. I have now been advised that these revenue savings will not be realised because the estimated savings were mistakenly calculated on the basis that the accelerated depreciation provision would continue to be available until 30 June 2002 as reflected in section 57AM of the Income Tax Assessment Act. However, because complementary amendments to the Ships (Capital Grants) Act proposed by the previous government were not made, the accelerated rate would not, in any event, operate beyond 30 June 1997.</PARA>

We are particularly concerned as a result of the confusion that has arisen from the 1994 tax office draft ruling on the issue of rendering of service. We believe that the interpretation that has been pursued by the tax office is not an appropriate one and that this parliament ought to provide advice to the tax office to clarify this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the draft ruling, simply acknowledging the scholarship provider in a report or publication would be considered to be rendering a service, therefore just about anybody undertaking postgraduate work and having their work published may in fact be subject to this interpretation. The Labor opposition believes that this is an unreasonable interpretation. Over and above that, however, we think that to try to determine the tax status of a scholarship on the basis of a flawed approach is doing nothing to create anything other than concern and confusion amongst the very people we are relying upon to provide this country with an essential part of its research work. If the draft ruling is implemented, we are likely to see quite serious disincentives being provided to people trying to undertake postgraduate research.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our concerns have been as a result of detailed consultations that we have undertaken with relevant sections of the education industry and the grave concern that has been expressed by the representative groups of students in the postgraduate research areas. We believe that you do not need a definition of a scholarship to be enshrined in the law itself. While this bill, as I said earlier, seeks to maintain the existing law, what we do need defined is a mechanism to protect the existing practice. We feel that definitions are likely to place unforeseen limits on what might in fact be regarded as a scholarship. This would open it up to all sorts of confusion and further disincentives in terms of students undertaking research scholarships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not believe that the amendments circulated by Senator Stott Despoja are neces sary. The tax office has already indicated in its draft rulings that it does not believe that the payments received by a student in his or her capacity as an employee rather than a student are by way of qualifying as a scholarship. We have indicated that, as far as we are concerned, the tax office consideration of scholarship to be granted made primarily for the education of a student is an appropriate way to proceed. We think that is an entirely reasonable basis on which to make a judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that this parliament needs, however, to provide further guidance to the tax office on, not so much the issue of what constitutes a scholarship, but what it means to render a service. We think it needs to be crystal clear that there is not a valid test of whether or not a payment is to be considered a scholarship. Under those circumstances, the best way to achieve the clarification of this issue is simply to omit the clause itself. That is what we are proposing&mdash;a very simple, straightforward means of ensuring certainty and the protection of students by the omission of the clause itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We ask the minister: where does the government stand on that particular matter? I think it is a fundamental issue in the bill and it is the primary amendment in this regard. The acceptance of this provision by us will
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5459"> render the alternative propositions here unnecessary. I will be seeking some advice from the government on what they say as to the impact of this particular measure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of issues have been raised, and I will seek to respond briefly. In relation to the matters raised by Senator Carr, the government's position in respect of scholarships is that the tax law currently provides fair treatment; that is, income derived by way of a scholarship is exempt from income tax unless there is a specific condition of the scholarship that the student will, or will if required, render services to the scholarship provider.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also note at this point that the tax law has provided this treatment for scholarships since 1951. It is a little curious that the Labor Party should wait until now to change  the treatment&mdash;after all, they were in office for 13 years during which, if they were concerned, they had the time to adjust the rules. It is even more curious, given that the commissioner's draft ruling on scholarships was released in April 1994. So it was no secret to the Labor Party when in power as to how the commissioner interpreted the provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the remarks raised by Senator Harradine and his asking for the government's position in relation to the amendment which has been proposed by the Democrats&mdash;and we can do the numbers Senator Harradine, and we have had extensive discussions&mdash;it would seem that the Senate is determined to make some changes to this part of the bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the mind of the Greens (WA), Senator Carr's amendment is preferable to the current situation. The Australian Tax Office ruling threatens a large number of scholarships that we think are quite legitimate. There have been very few cases brought up under the old definition of 23z(i), and there is no indication of widespread abuse. However, I am cognisant of the fact that I do not want abuse to increase&mdash;and, in the current socioeconomic situation, it could. This is why I have proposed an amendment, an alternative to z(i).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I support Senator Carr's amendment as a second best option, I do so with the intention that, in removing this, it sends a signal to government that it must come back with a formula of words more acceptable to the Senate. In this case I would not be opposing the amendment. I would not have thought it the best option, but it would seem there might well be the situation where the majority of the Senate does oppose the amendment, and I would like to think the ALP will then support alternatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are cases of abuse. I have heard of one case where a telecommunications company offered a scholarship to a student to research a certain electronic switch; I have heard of another where a herbicide company offered a scholarship for developing herbicide resistant wheat.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the current practice is fair and reasonable. But our concern is to ensure that the current practice is maintained rather than the current law. I think, in real terms, with what you have seen since 1951, it may well be an argument that the current law has not been implemented. Our concern with the draft ruling is that, while it may be consistent with the law, it is not consistent with the current practice. Essentially, that is the issue we are trying to resolve here today.

First of all, the minister should know that the Democrats are not concerned about levels of offence when it comes to fixing up laws that may be bad or that in fact may cause offence to people in a particular sector, such as the postgraduate sector. I also want to correct any implication that ours is in any way a watered down or less effective solution simply because the government finds it least offensive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, Senator Carr, you referred to the supposed simplicity of your amendment, but I put it to you that should not the ALP, of all parties, be concerned about the prospect of

That is quite a fundamental concern, and it is something we have sought to address in our amendments. I put on record very strongly that the Democrats, along with some of the other minor parties, have been concerned with this issue from the beginning.

I know that some have said our proposition has the potential to leave loopholes, but I would like to see what they are.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated, I think the Democrat amendments are worthy of support.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is obviously not just what a person's position is within the company. Of course, the amount received and whether a person continues to be there, has been established by Senator Stott&hyphen;Despoja. In my opinion there is also the issue of what happens to the research. This is something we will have to revisit at some stage. Maybe there is not a way to deal with this properly here because, in trying to deal with it, sometimes we disadvantage students who really do not have the fault themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does seem that if a person ends up conducting research and then cannot do with that research the kinds of things we would like to see people do&mdash;that is, liaise with other people doing research or develop it further if they so desire or have some control over their intellectual property and so on&mdash;and if, in entering into research that is the basis upon which they undertake higher studies, then quite clearly it has nothing to do with pure research. At some stage we will have to address this. I believe we should not be providing incentives to go further in that direction&mdash;that is, pretend it is privately funded when in reality we know that com
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5462"> panies get deductions for doing it&mdash;and then find out that we have removed the intellectual property of the scientist or student.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another most important issue is that we have also removed the ability for them to liaise freely with other people doing research to enable the research to benefit all mankind. I know it is a corny concept, but it would be nice to continue to have research that is actually beneficial and that will develop science as research has done for centuries. We are very quickly going towards making a retrograde step. Perhaps I can indicate that we will revisit the issue of intellectual property and the commercial implications, and I hope to get the support of the Senate for that at some future time.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shift in employment practice has increasingly been designed to facilitate the just in time or `hollow' factory management practice. The principle is to use new technologies of communication, data processing, flexible production machinery and transport management so that effectively there are no stocks of material held and no finished product retained.

In addition, there are various reasons why it is to the advantage of companies to be able to dismiss employees or employ them under terms given under a different status to real, that is, full&hyphen;time, employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think this proposal by the government is going to exacerbate the practices we think are not leading in the right direction. Throughout the world greater levels of employee involvement and worker democracy in other systems have worked. Putting one group of people against another other has not. In such an environment it seems wrong to support a measure that would restrict employee share ownership schemes to full&hyphen;time employees. I do not see why we would want to give benefits to management in these kinds of companies who do not understand what best management practice is all about. We will support the opposition's amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

Therefore, if any schemes were offered that were open to greater than 66 per cent of employees but less than 75 per cent of employees, then this amendment will ensure that in the 1996&hyphen;97 year no employee will be put at any risk of having their scheme declared invalid.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Don't get sensitive Senator Kernot. You are meant to keep us all honest, remember. This is an election promise. It is clear from the comments that have been made that there is some serious misunderstanding of the nature of this proposal which has been put forward by the government. The government's amendments relating to employee share schemes are designed to increase participation in employee share schemes, not, as some senators have asserted, to run them down. The coalition recognises that employee share schemes contribute to strengthening employee participation in Australian business and encourage voluntary savings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have, therefore, doubled the tax concessions for employees and employers to make them more attractive and this should encourage greater take&hyphen;up by employees. We have also made it easier for schemes to qualify for concessional tax treatment. A two&hyphen;thirds offer requirement still requires a broad take-up. It is two&hyphen;thirds. The argument that this is designed for senior executives is totally fallacious. It is a two&hyphen;thirds take&hyphen;up. So, Senator, on that basis you are dead wrong. I stress again that a two&hyphen;thirds offer requirement requires a broad take&hyphen;up. The government's amendments do not in anyway prevent schemes from being offered to 75 per cent of permanent employees or even 100 per cent of employees. It does not inhibit it. It is designed to encourage it, not, as has been asserted, the reverse. We will therefore be opposing Labor's amendments which will force the coalition to break its election commitment&mdash;to reduce participation for qualifying shares.</PARA>

When the employee share acquisition scheme provision was being debated in 1995, Labor got the provisions wrong and omitted the word `permanent' so that for a share to qualify for concessional tax treatment the employee participation test must now be based on all the employer's employees, including casual, short&hyphen;term, temporary and overseas employees.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA STYLE="Para">In respect of this set of amendments, our intention is to seek to link the granting of capital gains tax rollover relief to employment growth quite directly. Unless the taxpayer can demonstrate, upon the sale and purchase of a new business during the 12&hyphen;month period following the acquisition of a new business
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employment, that growth has increased by 10 per cent compared to the business that was sold, the CGT rollover would not be granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are applying two tests when determining whether the 10 per cent target has been met: either a 10 per cent increase in full&hyphen;time equivalent employee hours or a 10 per cent increase in the aggregate payroll paid for by the employer in the form of salaries and wages. We believe these incentives will provide a direct link between the tax concessionality being offered&mdash;the rollover relief&mdash;and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments will ensure that the $1.2 billion of tax relief is put directly to achieving a good social outcome: namely, the generation of employment. We do not believe that $1.2 billion in tax relief should be given on the basis of a wish or on the basis of an assumption that employment will grow, particularly when that is the stated claim behind this tax change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a massive tax change. It is very significant. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has said on a number of occasions, as has the Treasurer, that it must generate more employment. We are linking this directly to the generation of employment. We say to small business, `Good on you. You receive this $1.2 billion tax relief. Good on you if you can increase your employment by at least 10 per cent.' We do not believe that is a big ask, given the stated intention of this provision, given its rationale and given the very significant sum of money involved, which is effectively a transfer from the public sector to the small business sector in the form of tax relief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other amendments we are dealing with in this schedule alter the net business asset test. The effect will be to turn this into a net assets test by including a provision that the personal use assets of the taxpayer will be included for the purposes of the test. This is the personal use, not the business assets. The  only exclusion to this will be personal use assets that have a value of $5,000 or less which will be excluded from the test. This is consistent with the treatment of personal use assets as contained in the capital gains tax provisions under the tax act.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5470">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of these amendments will be to include personal wealth assets such as art collections, antique collections, yachts and very expensive residences. We do not believe that, when calculating the assets for the purposes of this measure&mdash;which is a very extensive tax concession involving $1.2 billion of tax change&mdash;these types of personal assets should be excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall asking Senator Kemp on 12 December last year a question on notice concerning this capital gains tax rollover relief. I asked Senator Kemp:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will taxpayers with non&hyphen;business wealth (such as an art collection) worth many millions of dollars be eligible for CGT rollover relief if their net business assets are less than $5 million?</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Assistant Treasurer answered:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will provide Capital Gains Tax (CGT) rollover relief to small and medium sized enterprises. To be eligible for rollover relief taxpayers must satisfy a number of tests, including that the net value of the taxpayer's assets must not exceed $5 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of meeting this test, an `asset' does not include, where the taxpayer is an individual who is not acting as a trustee, an asset for the personal use and enjoyment of the individual or an associate of the individual. As a result, if an individual has an expensive antique or art collection, which is kept for the individual's personal use and enjoyment, then it will not be taken into account in determining whether the $5 million threshold is satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We are saying it should be taken into account. Senator Kemp went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The taxpayer will not be eligible for rollover relief on disposal of items from the antique or art collection, as these items are not active assets in a taxpayer's business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, different rules apply if an individual is acting as a trustee. For example, where a trust owns both business assets and other assets (such as antiques or works of art), the value of all of the assets owned by the trust will be taken into account in determining whether the $5 million threshold is satisfied. </PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sorry, they will be put in two groups, but we are debating them together. I think that probably clarifies the position. The opposition has proposed to limit small business rollover relief only to cases in the 12 months following the disposal of an asset. The average employment or aggregate payroll paid by the taxpayer has increased by at least 10 per cent. We consider, and I stress `we consider', that this cannot be implemented as it would be near impossible to measure whether employment has increased due to the rollover of assets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several issues arise. The requirement that employment must be created within 12 months is arbitrary and ignores the longer term employment created by small business. The requirement that employment or total payroll paid must increase by 10 per cent is arbitrary and can be difficult to meet in the  short term. The provisions would be unfair during any economic downturn and when employment growth is sluggish. I stress that accepting these provisions would lead to a significant degree of complexity in the tax law. In turn this would increase the compliance and administration costs for small business and may only result in creating addition
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5471"> al jobs for the Australian Taxation Office to administer the provisions. The accounting profession will have to comply&mdash;or to work out how to comply, we hope&mdash;with the provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's requirements relating to the average number of employees and the aggregate payroll would be very difficult to comply with and impossible to administer in multiple disposals. The opposition's amendments are based on the presumption that the CGT rollover relief for small business will not facilitate the creation of new jobs. There has been no evidence put forward to support this. In fact, evidence suggests that small business is the engine room for the creation of new jobs in the economy and the government has placed considerable importance on facilitating its expansion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent BIE publication entitled `Industry Brief September 1995' has shown that small businesses have been the major generators of new jobs in the Australian economy since the mid&hyphen;1980s. The government has specifically designed the rollover relief measure so that there is a bias towards employment creating activities, that is, rollover relief is only available where the capital gain is invested in active income generating assets, not passive assets. So we will be opposing the amendments put forward by the opposition in relation to the employment test, for the reasons that I have stated, not the least of which is the major problems which will occur in relation to compliance and the arbitrary nature of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has proposed that personal assets be included in the $5 million threshold for access to rollover relief. Personal assets were excluded from the measure, for simplicity and for equity reasons. Let me just say that the measure that has been proposed will not just affect medium sized and larger business groups which may qualify for this provision. As I said, Labor has proposed that personal assets be included in the $5 million threshold test for access to rollover relief. Personal assets were excluded from the measure, as I said, for simplicity and equity. The proposal will lead to a significant increase in compliance costs for small business. Taxpayers will
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be required to value their personal assets, including the family home and family car, et cetera. I think, even with a subsequent amendment that has been proposed, the person in small business will still be forced to value their personal assets and the increase in compliance costs which is involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the measures which were proposed in our election policy. They were very popular messages and the government believes they enjoy very wide support in the community. Small business is waiting for these measures to go through. We urge the Senate to support the government's position.</PARA></SPEECH>

I think we have to look at this implication.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Often one of the biggest job shedders at the moment is corporate Australia which is running on some of the advantages given to it by government to enable it to do so. It is in fact encouraged to shed employees. We might be working at the wrong end of town here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing we have to do for small business is improve its market&mdash;that is, improve consumer confidence and the ability of people to have knowledge that they are going to survive in their job for more than the next week or so. I think the amendments do need more work, but I do applaud the initiative. I would like to see more initiatives come up in relation to employment strategies and industry policy, definitely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ALP amendment No. 8 in relation to rollover relief is, we believe, designed for battlers in small business. Under proposed section 160ZZPP, it will not be available to those  with assets over $5 million. The issue here is that not all assets are counted. To be brief, we think this is a reasonable measure to prevent this from being yet another rort for those able to construct companies and trusts at will.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bill proposes to enact the decision to terminate the infrastructure borrowings&mdash;IB&mdash;scheme introduced by Labor as part of the One Nation statement. Private investors had long complained that the tax system was biased against the private provision of infrastructure. So Labor listened and introduced the IB scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The IB scheme involves assisting private sector involvement in various infrastructure projects by modifying the tax system. This private sector investment was historically impeded because the initial years' losses generated by most&mdash;or all&mdash;of the projects could not be offset against the other income of the investors unless the project was undertaken by a single investor only as part of a wholly owned company group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sheer size of most infrastructure projects, worth either hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, meant that no Australian company was big enough&mdash;or very rarely big enough&mdash;to undertake the project on their own. Of course, it is generally commercially advantageous to have partners as they provide expertise in various specialist aspects of the project&mdash;for example, finance, construction, engineering services&mdash;so it is natural that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> most projects would be undertaken by consortia. These projects, though, would then confront the tax problem I mentioned before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The IBs overcame this problem by reducing the cost of infrastructure finance by effectively transferring the tax benefit of the tax deductibility of interest from the borrower to the lender. This was achieved by making the interest non-deductible to the borrower and either non-assessable to the lender or assessable but subject to a rebate equal to the company tax rate. This allowed a reduction of the rate in interest that lenders will charge borrowers for infrastructure projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Projects were assessed by a statutory authority&mdash;the Development Allowance Authority, which is at arms length to government&mdash;on their merit and according to the statutory criteria. This system was starting to function very effectively as an incentive and as leverage for significant projects, which may not have been delivered for many years&mdash;if at all&mdash;due to budgetary conditions in the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That said, there were some problems. For example, Labor announced that IBs would cease to be available for urban road projects from late 1995, a decision that was later overturned by the Treasurer (Mr Costello). Secondly, there is some evidence that aggressive tax planning was creeping into the marketing of IBs at the retail level. These were matters that warranted being addressed by the government. However, the Treasurer's announcement in February was an over&hyphen;reaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 14 February 1997, Treasurer Costello announced the government's intention to: prevent the lodging of any new IB applications; prevent the certification of any more projects under the IB arrangements, including those currently before the certification authority&mdash;the Development Allowance Authority; and, thirdly, terminate the right of variation of the conditions attaching to existing IBs where the Tax Commissioner considers this may cause an increased cost to the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite literally, he cut the IB program off at the knees, head, arms&mdash;the lot. There were no warnings, no apologies to those who were not seeking to rort the system. There was no
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5476"> respect for the continuation of normal pro cessing of applications. No thought was given to the impact of the decisions on the applicants, nor of the delays, nor the effect on the regions where the infrastructure is planned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> During the press conference the Treasurer also flagged that alternative arrangements for infrastructure would be announced in the 1997-98 budget. The new replacement program has now been announced and it is completely inadequate. I will return to this matter later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pretence under which the Treasurer acted was that there was a serious threat to revenue. What he did not say was that there is already an effective mechanism to cap the revenue cost of the measure&mdash;indeed it is a measure that he himself invoked in September 1996. He then claimed that the provisions could be rorted. Labor has stated that we will support any clampdown on rorts, and we will, but the complete cessation of the current program is an over&hyphen;reaction. At the press conference the Treasurer stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Development Allowance Authority has received legal advice to say that it is not able to refuse certification on the grounds that they are providing undue tax benefits and, as a result, the government will enact legislation effective from midday today which will prevent any of those applications being certified.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So instead of saying that the government will amend the law to grant a discretion to the DAA to reject any applications which are too tax aggressive, the Treasurer used this as a pretence to shut down the whole scheme. This is despite the fact that Mr Costello specifically acknowledged at the same press conference:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to keep stressing not every IB scheme is like what I've described today. There are a lot of IB schemes which are straight up and down in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the law and you know they are people trying to do the right thing and they're getting good investment infrastructure. I want to stress that point.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Treasurer's approach to this is duplicitous and, frankly, approaching a con. If you want to obtain savings from a tax expenditure, claim that it is being rorted. Then don't simply tighten the scheme to address any problems, cut the scheme completely to produce savings. Then if anybody wishes to analyse the alleged problems, or seeks actual
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> evidence of the claimed rorting, assert that they are supporting tax avoidance. This was the model pursued with the research and development syndication concession and it is also being put in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite this over&hyphen;reaction, Labor does not seek to defeat the bill. We recognise that the government has made an announcement and this, in practice, has been implemented. It has thrown the existing rules into chaos but we cannot now undo that chaos.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That said, we are concerned about the need for transitional provisions to assist some genuine projects which were: firstly, well advanced along the certification process; secondly, not aimed at rorting the tax system; and, thirdly, going to provide desirable regional development opportunities. This was one of the key issues which has been considered by the Senate committee which examined the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should people who have done the right thing be penalised? Why should Australia's reputation as a stable place to invest and do business be threatened as it has been in this instance? Which projects have now been threatened by cutting off the scheme?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were many worthwhile projects. Some examples of those were given in evidence before the Senate committee. They included the Redbank power project, which is an important project for the Hunter region, which is proposing to pioneer in Australia a relatively environmentally friendly electricity production process using coal waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales central&hyphen;west gas pipeline project is a proposal to build a 255&hyphen;kilometre open access natural gas pipeline from Marsden to Forbes, Parkes, Narromine and Dubbo. It is now in doubt because of the termination of the IB scheme. And there is a further 300&hyphen;kilometre extension of that pipeline, which would connect Dubbo to Tamworth, with laterals to Gunnedah, Gulgong and Mudgee and worth $45 million, similarly threatened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other projects which have been unfairly treated under the Treasurer's decision. I mention these two as examples only. I also mention them to make the point
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5477"> that there are two categories of projects from the point of view of the opposition: those that we can assist by amending this legislation, such as Redbank. And I think there is another project in Queensland, a Queensland gas power station known as Oakey; and, regrettably, those that we cannot assist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can assist the Redbank and another few projects by seeking to overturn the most pernicious aspect of the bill, namely, the retrospective nullification of the certification of projects that has occurred since the Treasurer's announcement in February.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Incredibly, this bill seeks to overturn some arm's&hyphen;length decisions already taken by the Development Allowance Authority according to the current law. That approach is indefensible, as this is effectively political interference in investment decisions that regrettably does occur in some other countries around the world. The government should be ashamed of itself for the message that political interference sends out to the international investor community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is not merely proposing to change the rules midway through the game. It is proposing to change the result after the game has ended. The opposition cannot support such an outrageous proposal, and I will move amendments in the committee stage to overturn these proposed provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the opposition cannot assist the other projects which are caught in the decision making pipeline but for which a decision has not been made by the DAA. While we deplore the treatment of these projects, they have not yet been certified and it is not the proper function of the Senate to attempt to favour some uncertified projects over others, no matter what may be the public good and the merit in some of those uncertified projects. However, the opposition will look very closely at the new scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's new scheme was announced in the budget. It was not announced with much fanfare because it is a pale imitation of the arrangements it seeks to replace. Frankly, like everything else in the budget, it disappeared very quickly. It is called the `infrastructure borrowing tax rebate' but it really should not be so broadly characterised.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It is not a general scheme to assist the provision of private infrastructure in Australia; it is targeted only at land transport projects, although those projects which were left in limbo on 14 February are allowed to apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The limitations seem extraordinary, given that in the same budget we are told that for the savings rebate it is wrong to favour any one type of saving and we must benefit all types equally. It is an incredibly different application of principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the administration has been transferred to the Tax Commissioner from the DAA. While Labor has no problem with the involvement of the Tax Commissioner on specific tax matters, I am not sure what expertise the commissioner will bring to the question of infrastructure. Indeed, I wonder if the commissioner wants yet another area of responsibility on top of his considerable current responsibilities&mdash;additional complexity and cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area of change will be the reduction in the rate of concession that will apply to superannuation funds and other taxpayers that face lower nominal rates of tax than the company tax rate. Labor specifically made IBs more attractive to super funds through the 36 per cent rebate option. This was working in attracting finance from some super funds into infrastructure. These changes may put that trend at risk. It continues the inexplicable attack on superannuation that has been engaged in by this current Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth&mdash;and arguably the most important&mdash;change has been the totally inadequate funding allocation to the concession. The government is allocating $37.5 million in 1997&hyphen;98 and $75 million in subsequent years. This contrasted with $200 million that Labor had allocated to our IB program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, many or most of the projects that have been left in limbo will not fit into the tiny allocation. In any event, it appears that there will be no approvals of projects under the new arrangements until 1 January 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not detain the Senate any more on this issue. I will be speaking briefly in committee. I do understand the pressures for time  on the Senate, but we have had to make what
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5478"> are the very basic and minimal contributions in the debate, and will do so again in the committee stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill has been a vexed issue for the Greens, as I think it has been for a number of people. Initially, the Greens (WA) were strong opponents of the infrastructure borrowings scheme, especially when it was the provision of incentives and benefits for the private sector owned infrastructure that would be used as an alternative to, or replacement for, public sector infrastructure: private power plants, private motorways, tollways and so on. Even before I was a senator I was speaking out on this issue in relation to the subsidy to the Collie coal&hyphen;fired power station.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the scheme evolved, the funding of roads lost favour, and the scheme began to be used to fund some fairly good projects: co&hyphen;generation, sewage and water treatment plants. As the public sector in power and water was privatised in a wholesale manner, the implications of giving advantages to desirable projects also changed. In a private sector context, to give advantages to projects that are less polluting or that address environmental problems is worthwhile, if the discrimination about what is good for the environment is done with integrity&mdash;and that is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, we think the infrastructure borrowings scheme was moving in the right direction, although in our opinion it still fell well short of what we would have liked. It could be a tool for promoting appropriate and less ecologically damaging infrastructure. The government now wants to cut the scheme and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> devise a new one that will effectively replicate the original bad scheme, to be primarily used to give support for private roadways, motorways and tollways as well as rail projects. As such, the Greens (WA) will strongly oppose it when it reaches the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I give notice right now that we will try to amend it by taking out any support for roads and putting in support for rail and for energy projects such as co&hyphen;generation and development of power specifically from renewable resources. We would also seek to include projects for high level cleaning of sewage and waste water, especially energy efficient projects. The dumping of sewage waste and waste water into our fresh water systems is not supportable, and we should be doing things which are going in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The old infrastructure borrowing provisions, as I said, were problematic but improving; and the new scheme, as formulated, is a retrograde disaster. In this context we are also asked to decide on the fate of four projects which have been certified but are not included in the current scheme because the certification came too late. The ALP has an amendment to allow them to be included. We know that there is a measure of justice in that, in the sense that these industries have planned and proceeded on the expectation that their efforts would not be invalidated by Treasury fiat at the last moment. On the other hand the aged, the poor and students plan their lives on the expectation that a given fee regime or benefit regime will apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also know that indication was given to various applicants originally that they should not go any further. So, if we were to support the four that did push on, even though they were told the scheme was no longer effective, we would potentially be discriminating against those people who chose to take the advice that the scheme was no longer operative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, we are prepared to listen to an undertaking by the minister to deal with these projects expeditiously. We have circulated a second reading amendment to that effect,  calling for those projects that have already been certified to be given priority in the timing of their reconsideration under the new scheme. I am not asking that they be given
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5479"> priority for approval, just that they be first in terms of what schemes are considered. I think that is fair. The amendment also says that the Senate asks for these schemes to be dealt with expeditiously, which again is only fair, particularly if we are not supporting the ALP amendment to allow them to qualify under the old scheme&mdash;which, I have to say, we will not be doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the problem for us was that not all of the schemes are ones that we are entirely happy with. I have to say that, in particular, it is interesting that Redbank has been argued on environmental grounds. The arguments are convoluted, and the project has been opposed by the Newcastle Greens, Greenpeace and the Total Environment Centre. On the other hand, they argue that it is a project that produces emission levels worse than those of other black coal plants and that it displaces cleaner coal and perpetuates coal burning. They feel it will be a technology applied to other coal plants and so will increase their emission levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The project proponents argue that emission levels will now be better than other black coal plants in Victoria. But, in reality, what we end up with is that Redbank may create a more competitive situation for black coal, at the cost of increasing emissions and burning coal in an overall dirtier way. In all, we do not think that the arguments on environment hold better. On the other hand, the Greens feel that making minor technical improvements to undesirable technology is not necessarily a step forward. There are better ways of producing power: gas as an interim source, and renewables as the preferred option. There should be a cap on coal fired and diesel power of all sorts. It is simply not smart in the current international regime for Australia to be seen to be continuing to hand out incentives to people who are in fact not moving in the right direction in relation to greenhouse gas production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think we can or should create special cases for coal fired power. The project should be considered expeditiously, but power stations based on gas power&mdash;and, in the case of Parkeston, based on replacing diesel fired power&mdash;will go ahead, although Oakey would
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> do better in competition with dirtier power if it were given the same infrastructure borrowing benefits. There are other issues, such as the Port Stephens sewerage plant which might go ahead with stage one but not stage two, and I note that there is some community objection to that project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, I do not agree with claims that there are overriding environmental reasons to support the inclusion of all of those projects under the old scheme. I am prepared to let them be considered under the new scheme; but, as it might be said: `If it were done, when `tis done, then `twere well it were done quickly'. I commend my second reading amendment to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill puts into legislation the intention of the government to close down the infrastructure borrowing scheme which was introduced by the former Labor government. When Treasurer Costello announced that, the Democrats welcomed it. We reminded others that EPAC found there was no real need for the scheme, because there was no tax disadvantage for private sector infrastructure. In fact, EPAC went so far as to say the money would be better spent by putting more into the public provision of infrastructure which it could do more cheaply than the private sector could over the medium term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Commission of Audit set up by this government came to a similar view, and concluded that the tax arrangements needed to be reviewed. Following the audit commission recommendations, over the next three months the body responsible for the infrastructure borrowing concessions, the Development Allowance Authority, was&mdash;we are told&mdash;inundated with applications. By September it had 71 applications for a total investment of $21 billion, an estimated tax cost of $4 billion. This was well in excess of the $200 million per year the government had capped for assistance under this scheme. On 10 September 1996, the Treasurer directed the DAA to take no further applications. On 14 February 1997, the Treasurer announced that legislation would be introduced to prevent the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5480"> DAA from issuing any further certificates unless they were subject to an undertaking, and the Democrats supported that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has proposed some interesting amendments to ensure that four projects, which continued to insist on having certificates issued by the DAA even though the Treasurer had closed down the scheme, should be grandfathered. There are some very important competing principles here: the principle of retrospectivity and the principle of legislation effecting good environmental outcomes. That is a particular concern with respect to the Redbank power station. However, I am going to listen carefully to the arguments from the Labor Party on these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support the closure of the infrastructure bonds scheme. It was one of the most dubious ideas ever dreamt up by the former Keating government. It was never a fair or a cost effective measure. Certainly, it was not an effective alternative to reversing the massive decline in public sector investment in infrastructure. I might add, though, that we think the Howard government's plan to replace it with an even smaller scheme just for road and rail, worth $75 million a year, while at the same time reducing spending on public sector infrastructure by a massive $948 million&mdash;that is $75 million to $948 million next year&mdash;is just as dubious a policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The country needs modern, efficient infrastructure as an essential base for economic development. Tax breaks to make others do what is essentially the responsibility of governments are not the most cost&hyphen;effective way of achieving it. Those afraid to embrace the need to broaden the revenue raising base of this country find themselves without the money to do what is necessary and without the political will to tackle it. I do not think a GST is the answer to this particular problem, if you are going to quote tax reform, Senator Kemp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats support the second reading amendment moved by Senator Margetts. I think it makes some really important points in principle, but it does not require the Treasurer to do anything about it. We are making an important statement of principle. It would be

Let me make it clear that the  government announced in the budget a replacement scheme for the infrastructure borrowing arrangements in the form of an infrastructure borrowings rebate. In announ
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5481"> cing the rebate scheme, the government stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The program will be open for applications for assistance in respect of private land transport infrastructure projects; project proponents which had applied for an IBs certificate by 12 p.m. (by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory), 14 February 1997; and extensions of projects that had been certified to use IBs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The four projects referred to by senators will therefore be eligible to apply for assistance under the new rebate scheme. Given the advanced stage of these projects when the announcement was made to abolish the existing infrastructure borrowings scheme, the government considers that these projects should be given priority consideration under the new scheme. That deals with one of the central issues that were raised by a number of senators in the second reading debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the process for assessing applications, the government has established criteria which must be properly assessed.

In my speech during the second reading debate I believe I outlined the reasons why the two amendments we are considering in the committee stage should be passed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Margetts and Senator Brown misunderstand the process that the Treasurer
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (Mr Costello) followed. In my speech during the second reading debate I outlined that we fundamentally do not think it is the Treasurer's right to strike out the process; it is the parliament's right. Indeed, it is the parliament's obligation to strike out the process. It is not up to the Treasurer to decree by press release that, as from that day forthwith, no further projects can be considered by the DAA. That is effectively what he has done. We are asking the parliament and the Senate to approve that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot accept that, as a principle, the Treasurer can get up at any time and, by decree in a press release, say, `Forthwith, in terms of the legal process which is being followed'&mdash;in this case by the DAA, but in any other case by perhaps a tribunal or a court&mdash;`it is our policy that we do not agree. This process should stop today,' even though, legally, the process is required to go on until this parliament approves the cessation of the process. We cannot support that in principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens may have environmental concerns about some of these projects. It is apparent from the second reading amendment moved by Senator Margetts that the Greens have concerns about one such project. The second reading amendment refers to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the implications of decisions on Australia's ability to meet likely future Greenhouse obligations agreed by the majority of other nations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I refer to the case in point&mdash;Redbank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the Senate record, the Singleton Shire Council issued a development consent for the project in 1994, with 47 conditions. The council's action followed a year&hyphen;long process of environmental assessment and public comment. Greenpeace appealed to the New South Wales Land and Environment Court, questioning the need for power and the projected CO2 emissions. There was a full trial on the merits, lasting more than a week, held before Justice Pearlman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After finding that the council's actions were not contrary to the national greenhouse  reduction strategy, the Chief Justice drew the following conclusions:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All these matters led, in my opinion, to a conclusion that the greenhouse issue should not outweigh all other
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5482"> factors relevant to the determination of whether or not to grant consent but must be taken into account in the court's overall assessment of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What then are the other factors which the court must take into account in reaching this determination? Redbank pointed to the beneficial environmental effect of the project. It will use tailings as fuel, thereby avoiding the detrimental effects of tailings disposal in dams. It will produce lower emissions of SO2 and NOX in comparison to the coal&hyphen;fire power stations which it is likely to displace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are other beneficial effects as well. The project will reduce the amount of land sterilised by tailing dams. It will convert a waste product into a usable one. It will permit more efficient use of energy resources by recovering coal currently discarded in tailings. The project was comprehensively assessed by council. Government and other authorities were consulted and objections addressed. In taking all these matters into account, I have concluded that the development application should be approved.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In February 1997, Redbank applied to the New South Wales Land and Environment Court for a modification of the development consent in regard to the improvements to reduce CO2 emissions. National Power fully briefed Greenpeace on the modification and Greenpeace did not contest the application. The modification was granted as requested. With respect to this project, every reasonable environmental consideration that could have been taken into account, was taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue I draw to the attention of the Senate, and particularly to my Greens colleagues, is that one of the four projects relates to Port Stephens. It is a sewerage project to clean up the ocean, which will otherwise be polluted by sewage emissions. That is one of the projects that may not go ahead as a consequence of the government's approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are disappointed with the Greens' approach on these four development projects which we are seeking to ensure. They followed due process, they applied to the DAA, and they were granted approval. It is not up to the Treasurer to unilaterally gut the approval process, which is what he did and what he is asking us to approve retrospectively. I certainly do not think Greenpeace would have been thrilled if the Treasurer had announced that he was, in the national interest, determined to override the courts in respect of this
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Redbank project and introduce retrospective legislation so Greenpeace could not hear any part of the process, either through the New South Wales Land and Environment Court or the appeal before the Chief Justice. I certainly do not think the Greens would have been happy if the process had been gutted, as is effectively being proposed in respect of four of the projects that the amendments go to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, on environmental grounds, Redbank is an innovative coal fired power station in the Hunter, using coal tailings; and it also has very important economic and employment consequences. It is the same with the other projects. I certainly believe they withstand any reasonable environmental test. I would not want to see the Port Stephens sewerage project not go ahead, for example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the effect of the amendments we are considering. I do not know whether my contribution has changed the position of the two Green senators.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just briefly, I did make my comments in relation to the aspect of the environment. Very clearly, I do not know of any environmental project that has been knocked back on an environmental impact assessment based on its CO2 emissions; it does not happen. Maybe it should happen, but it does not. The fact that it has got environmental approval does not mean that it is environmentally sound in terms of its greenhouse emissions. Even the government uses SOx and NOx, sulfur and  nitrogen gases, as a reason for promoting coal fire. We have all got to get into this century and see what the needs are and what is happening in the international arena. This is not good enough any more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have admitted that there are some improvements on some additional technologies, but that is certainly not an improvement on greenhouse emissions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not wanting to repeat what happened before, in the absence of anyone else standing, I have stood. In relation to the Commonwealth vehicles bills, this legislation is just another example of the blind ideological belief of this government in privatisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst in the past I have been critical of the long&hyphen;term economic costs and the social and environmental costs of other privatisation decisions, this bill does not make any financial sense, particularly in the long term. Whilst the sale of DASFLEET has the immediate effect of reducing budget outlays, the ongoing costs will almost certainly be increased as a result of the new owner's charges, which will be greater because of the high interest charges that the new owner will incur, because no&hyphen;one can obtain finance as cheap as the long&hyphen;term government bond rate. In addition, the new owner of these vehicles will want to pass on some margin representing their profit on top of the borrowing costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have it on good authority that, assuming that DASFLEET is worth approximately $300 million, operating costs could increase by $24 million per annum. In reality, what we are doing in this bill, in my opinion, is giving a subsidy to private industry. I do not see the rationale for it, except an ideological one. It is yet another example of short&hyphen;term economic benefits outweighing any longer term economic costs. The Greens will be opposing these bills.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government, in presenting these bills, is simply maintaining the status quo of exemption from state and territory taxes and charges, including compulsory third&hyphen;party
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> insurance applying to motor vehicles used by the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say from the outset, the Labor opposition will not oppose the passing of the legislation. We do not wish to be unnecessarily obstructionist. We accept that this legislation in no way pre&hyphen;empts the final decision on either the sale or the refinancing of DASFLEET. It just ensures that, whatever decision the government takes, it will be cost neutral. Nor will we be obstructing the legislation to actually prevent the sale or refinancing. But we cannot pass up this opportunity that is provided by this legislation to expose the government's hypocrisy and double standards on privatisation, competitive neutrality, Commonwealth&hyphen;state financial relations and taxation reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us get clear what this legislation provides for. Firstly, the legislation exempts from state and territory taxes the transfer of DASFLEET assets, including the motor vehicle fleet. It is standard practice to exempt certain privatisation transactions from stamp duty, but only when the stamp duty arises on the actual transfer refinancing, and only when the privatisations are of an equity nature&mdash;that is, shares. That is not what we are talking about here. The privatisation of DASFLEET is the sale of specific physical assets&mdash;a different category altogether. The stamp duty that any ordinary Australian would have to pay when they purchase a car or that any company operating a vehicle leasing business would have to pay on the vehicles they purchase will not have to be paid by the new owner of DASFLEET vehicles. What a bargain!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the legislation establishes a motor vehicle register, exempting vehicles on the register from the need to be registered under a law of the state or territory or to have third&hyphen;party insurance. The Commonwealth currently operates several thousand vehicles registered under state and territory law. They are mostly  vehicles provided under senior executive vehicle schemes. The Commonwealth currently pays registration fees. However, it does not currently pay stamp duty on the registration of such vehicles, due to its exemption from state and territory taxes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5485">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is arguing that this legislation will maintain this position by extending the exemption to the private owner of vehicles where those vehicles are leased to the Commonwealth for at least three months. However, the existing arrangements are being changed in one important respect&mdash;the vehicles will not be owned by the Commonwealth any more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, where the vehicle is leased to the Commonwealth for at least three months continuously, the leases will be exempt from state and territory taxes levied on leasing arrangements. Again, this is a new tax exemption which is being imposed by the Commonwealth. It is not the continuation of an existing arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, the Commonwealth currently bears its own liability for third&hyphen;party insurance through the Commonwealth Motor Vehicles (Liability) Act 1959. The second bill extends the Commonwealth's liability to cover vehicles that are leased to the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority through an amendment to the 1959 legislation. It is worth noting that the measures in these bills will apply to vehicles leased to the Commonwealth by any company, not just the purchaser of DASFLEET.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I would like to make is that a critical feature of privatisation of public businesses is that they subsequently come fully within the tax net as opposed to their status when in public ownership. Currently, a business owned by the Commonwealth is exempt from such taxes because of the exemption from state and territory taxes which the Commonwealth enjoys. What is happening in the DASFLEET privatisation is that ownership is being transferred from the Commonwealth to the private sector. Accordingly, the ongoing exemption from state and territory registration charges and stamp duty on lease documents, which this legislation proposes, is completely inconsistent with the usual privatisation practice. The fact that the Commonwealth subsequently uses the service is not relevant in this sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims that, without the legislation, the Commonwealth would incur
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> costs in the first year of approximately $10 million in registration fees, stamp duty on registration and compulsory third&hyphen;party insurance. The present net value over 10 years is estimated at $45 million. Purchasers would be charged stamp duty on the transfer of assets, excluding vehicles, of approximately $2.75 million deducted from the sale price paid to the Commonwealth by purchasers. The new owner of the vehicles would be charged around $1.5 million per annum for stamp duty on leasing arrangements, which would be passed on to the Commonwealth through vehicle leasing charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government believed its own rhetoric about privatisation, this sale would probably not go ahead, because the costs this legislation seeks to eliminate are such as to make privatisation of DASFLEET too expensive for the government. You really have to wonder whether the current arrangements did not serve the government better. When this government privatises, it is not necessarily about good economics. It is purely about their ideological obsession with the diminishing role of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the government's supposed commitment to the principles of competitive neutrality? The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) on 20 August 1996 said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The application of full competitive neutrality will mean that DAS businesses will face tax equivalent payments, debt guarantee fees and dividend payments even when they are competing for Commonwealth government contracts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Perhaps the duty parliamentary secretary could explain to the Senate how these principles are being applied in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the Treasurer's attempt to impose Commonwealth wholesale sales taxes on the state and local governments last year? Remember that huge stand&hyphen;off at the Premiers Conference. One would have thought that what is good for the goose is good for the gander, but not when it comes to this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We accept that this bill protects the interests of the Commonwealth taxpayers and, accordingly, we will not be opposing the bill. But I invite Senator Campbell to explain the incon
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5486"> sistencies to which I have drawn the Senate's attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I further request that perhaps Senator Campbell could provide information to the Senate about the views of the victims of this legislation&mdash;that is, the states and territories. The coalition continually claims that they respect the proper role for states and territories, and that they are more federalist in their approach than the supposedly centralist ALP. However, it is the coalition who imposed tax on other governments. It is the coalition that cut $1.5 billion out of general purpose funds&mdash;the discretionary funds of states and territories&mdash;not the Labor Party. It is the coalition that is cutting specific purpose payments to these other governments. And it is the coalition which seeks to provide a special exemption for the Commonwealth from state and territory taxes. At a time when these governments are closing hospital beds and cutting back vital services, we believe that it is incumbent on the government to explain why it is further reducing that revenue that would otherwise flow to the states.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition sees this issue in this way. There is one bill which amends four bills which now provide bounties to four separate industries in Australia&mdash;the shipbuilding industry, the book manufacturing and publishing industry, the machine tools and robotics industry and the computer industry. The Senate in its wisdom, when this bill was before us last, supported the amendments that the government made to the shipbuilding industry&mdash;amendments the government had been forced to make in bilateral discussions with that industry. That meets our position to rectify the situation for that industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this bill was before us last, the Senate supported the government's motion on machine tools and robotics, which enables that bounty to expire on Monday 30 June but without going back to the government's original position of 30 June 1996 and thus having to retrospectively claw back the amount of bounty paid to the manufacturers of machine tools and robotics in Australia. When this bill was before the Senate last, it insisted that the government's pre&hyphen;election promise that the computer bounty be maintained until the end of the century be the position, and the government rejected that. The Senate's view was to support that. Now the House, where the government has a majority, has said that it insists on the government's original position, which was to terminate the computer bounty from Monday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth bill relates to the book manufacturing and publishing industry. The Senate extended the book bounty to the end of the year. If the book bounty was not extended against the government's wishes then it would terminate on Monday too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that the government is saying to us now, `We will honour the deal that we have reached with the builders of fast catamaran ferries in Australia, accepting that if you insist that the computer industry should have
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the bounty we will not honour it.' The motion I foreshadowed I would move, if we go back to reporting progress to enable me to move it, would have the effect of dividing this one bill which amends those four bills I have referred to so that the amendments would appear for each bill separately. The Senate could then accept the government's position, as we have previously said we would, on ships, and that could be disposed of. The divided bill would just amend the shipping building bounty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate could then accept the government's view on machine tools and robotics and that bill could be amended. Then the Senate could debate the amendments to the computer bill and the book bill separately as freestanding amendments. I want to prevent the government from cross&hyphen;trading and holding the Senate up to blackmail by saying, `If you do what you believe in your wisdom you should do on computers, we will scuttle the deal with the ships.' That is the purpose of what I want to achieve. I hope that is relatively well explained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really is designed to make it more difficult for the government to scuttle the computer bounty if the Senate in its wisdom continues its position. Of course the government still could if it were pernicious. If the government said that the Senate has divided this bill, and there are now four separate bills and each one will be dealt with separately, and it insists on all the amendments and changes that it has made and the position, as the Senate had before, remains the same and the government does not have one bill in which it can cross&hyphen;trade but four separate bills, it can still lay them aside and say we are not going to proceed. That part is true. I think it would make it harder for the government to do that if the amendments were to separate bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has reached with the leaders of the shipbuilding industry a specific deal, which was outlined by the minister in this chamber last week and which is set out in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> because I had it inserted in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> by leave of the Senate in the last debate. The terms and conditions of that discrete deal with that industry are clear. In the terms and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5490"> conditions of that deal with this industry there was no condition which said that if the Senate amends the computer bounty, the terms of this shipbuilding agreement are null and void.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the government is honour bound, irrespective of what fulminating it might undertake now, to observe the deal that it has done with the Australian shipbuilders&mdash;contracted between them in good faith; a contract by the shipbuilders with the government and by the government with the shipbuilders&mdash;without now for parliamentary tactical purposes putting a caveat on it that was never intended and would not apply: namely, that if in the case of the computer industry we want justice for them as well, the whole package with the shipbuilding industry fails.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> One is the shipbuilding side where you made an agreement, and that will involve considerable expenditure of revenue, and the other is the computer side. The other two do not amount to those same significant sums.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the opinion of the Australian Democrats that the government has not made their case about the computer bounty because at no time have you provided a cost benefit analysis which says, `This is the effect on jobs, investment, exports and growth but the savings to the revenue are greater than that.' I can see the pained look on your face, Minister. But during the debate on the bounties bill you stated several times to us that the Goldsworthy report would come down. It is within the possibilities of the Senate, for instance, to pass a further amendment stating that at such time as you bring a case to the Senate, perhaps in the next sitting, based on the results which will come out of the Goldsworthy report and out of the cost benefit analysis, the Senate would reconsider the matter of the computer bounty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, what the government is saying is that this costs more money than it is worth. What the Senate is saying is that you have never proven that to us. We have asked that consistently at estimates hearings and so on. If your main concern is the amount of money concerned with the computers, then you have the opportunity to do a bit more work once the Goldsworthy report comes down.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose that motion and argue that the Senate should insist upon its amendments. The Senate is of common view with the government and the House on the shipbuilding bounties. As I have said earlier in my remarks, that is an agreement reached by the government with the industry which contains no caveat subject to what the parliament may do with respect to any other bounties that come before it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government breaches its undertakings with the industry in order to try to score a political point, that political point will rebound against the government, not just with the shipbuilding industry and the workers in that industry in Western Australia and Tasmania but throughout all Australian industry, because it will mean that no industry sector can reach an agreement with the government and be sure that the government will honour that agreement. This would bring the government into massive disrepute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government already is subject to quite considerable disquiet in industry because of the lack of continuity or clarity about its industry policy. It is a major issue of economic concern in this nation that the government does not have an industry policy. This would compound it and put the government, I think, in an intolerable position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government says to the Senate, `If you insist on your views, we will blackmail you, we will penalise you by damaging this industry,' I say to the government, `That's rubbish; I call your bluff.' I do not believe that is true. The reprehensible position put by the minister on behalf of the government is not a position that I think is credible. Also, given the nature of the agreement&mdash;which, as I said, has been put in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;neither do I think the shipbuilding industry believes it is credible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just do not believe that the government could continue to act in that way. This is a bit  of parliamentary sport; this is not the real world. The government, and this Senate, should support the shipbuilding package&mdash;it is not perfect, but it is about 99.9 per cent perfect&mdash;and the government should imple
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5492"> ment it. The same is true of the machine tools and robotics bounty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leaves me to talk to the Senate about the other two bounties, which this Senate amended. The first of them is the books bounty. As I said last time in the debate over this bounty, this is an important industry for Australia. It is an area of comparative advantage in the Australian economy over other nations. That comparative advantage arises because we are an intelligent country. We have a high level of learning and literacy. We are able to write, design and present books that sell in the United States. Australian companies supply a number of the textbooks in the Californian education system, a number of the textbooks in the state of Florida's education system, a number of textbooks that are in circulation in India, in Malaysia and in other countries of the world. We export our intellectual capability in educational services by providing those books, and we do so and we win those contracts in the United States against the toughest competition in the world, and in Asia against strenuous competition from other nations to get the publishing rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This industry has been able to grow to that level because it had a bounty, and it was certain of when that bounty would expire. This legislation chops this bounty off, it disrupts the plans of the industry, it throws people in the major printing centres around Australia&mdash;but, most importantly, at Maryborough in Victoria&mdash;into disarray. It disrupts the advantage of the industry to be able to plan; it undercuts its ability to enter those foreign markets and maintain its position. That, taken together with the government cuts to the export market development grants scheme, on which this industry relies to get into foreign markets, is a massive blow against this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message from the House is not believable or credible. I cannot find one government member who in private will give it any credibility. It is a shrug of the shoulders and their saying, `Well, that's what we've got to say&mdash;but, well, you know, the implication is that we don't believe it.' Of course it is not believable, it is not credible. It suffers from
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the defect that it is not true. If it were true, it would be credible. The defect it has is that it is not true and it, therefore, is not credible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not just an issue of the book industry. The Senate economics committee, when it considered the bounties for this industry, had evidence before it about the government's insistence on charging the full measure of tariff; it had evidence before it about the level of tariff imposed on imported paper which goes to the manufacture of books in Australia. A cross-party committee of Liberals, Nationals, Democrats and the Australian Labor Party agreed that that level of tariff for the publication of books in Australia, where it does not compete with any Australian manufacturers of paper, should be removed&mdash;and that was a unanimous position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has declined to do so. Since we supply about 70 per cent of the paper needs for book manufacture in Australia, and import about 30 per cent, this government is imposing an extra surcharge on the cost of book manufacture in this country, while cutting out the bounty. This means that in the world this industry is vulnerable. It has been able to win against international competition, bearing these costs to industry assistance, cuts to industry assistance and the cost impost on having to pay a tariff for imported paper to go into their manufacture. This industry is being put deliberately at a commercial disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons, we reject the reasons provided by the House of Representatives. We argue strongly for the fact that, in the case of the books bounty, the original position of the Senate should be retained. That is the view of the printing industry. That is the view of the paper industry. Tasmanian paper manufacturers have made that view clear. It is the view of this industry and its workers. To take the stand the government has taken is to take a stand against employment in Australia, interesting, highly skilled, important jobs in Australia&mdash; </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;jobs in Tasmania, and see this industry go offshore. If the government insists and its motion is carried, we will
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5493"> be standing on the dock at Australian ports waving goodbye to this industry as it goes offshore. The record already is that, since the announcement in the 1996-97 budget that this bounty was to be cut, there has been a slow trickle of book publishers putting more work offshore and handling less work in Australia. That will continue. It will become a flood. For those reasons, I oppose the book bounty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to say that we oppose the computer bounty. The value of the book bounty is about $5 million per annum&mdash;a small price to pay. The value of the computer bounty is about $140&hyphen;odd million. The reason the government insists on taking away the computer bounty is the amount of money. It is not the principle of the thing, it is not the industry purpose the bounty serves; it is simply a crass cost&hyphen;cutting measure in order to remove the bounty and save money for the government&mdash;or so it believes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we saw in evidence before the Senate committee, in the case of these industries no cost&hyphen;benefit analysis has been done to check the impact on employment, to check the impact on taxes paid out of company profits in this sector, or to check the impact on other costs the government has to shell out. The one industry sector that had done a survey on that was the book industry. That survey showed there is, in fact, a net deficit to the budget by cutting out the bounty because, when you consider that you put people on the dole, you lose income tax from workers engaged in the workplace, you lose tax on company profits and you lose a number of other taxes, the net impact on the budget bottom line is negative in the cutting out of these bounties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the computer industry, it is even more so. As I said in this debate last week, the computer and telecommunications industry is now the biggest industry in the world. It is also the fastest growing and the most rapidly changing industry. Australia has a net trade deficit in the import of computer technology of $6 billion a year. By the end of this century that deficit will be $20 billion a year, even if the computer bounty is retained.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No study has been made to see what the budgetary benefit is. The government says, `We simply want this money', but they have not done any study to see what the negative effects of taking this money away will be on the growth and development of this industry or on the yawning gap of our trade deficit, or what will be the impact on jobs and on its own budget bottom line.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They won't do it. You are right: they can't do it. The government has said to us&mdash;the minister just said it a moment ago&mdash;`But we have the Goldsworthy report; we think this is an important industry, so we are looking at it'. What they are proposing to do is take $140 million out of the pockets of this industry, deal it a devastating blow, slam the stable door, let the horse bolt, and then say, `Let's conduct an examination to see what the impact is on the industry and work out how we grow the industry from here on.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For companies that have to plan in the long term in this, the fastest growing industry sector in the world, the most dynamically changing industry sector in the world, you remove their ability to plan for the future because you disrupt their planning at every stage. It is just an impossible position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an industry in which there are a number of headline, household name players that are world companies, but it is also an industry in which there are thousands of small Australian companies, each of which attract the bounty and each of which are important in maintaining our competence in this important field of technology&mdash;and important for maintaining the skills of the Australian work force as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude my remarks on the computer bounty by saying that the excuse of the government that the Goldsworthy task force will report is not a viable excuse as it will report after the event. It will be a survey of the wreckage and damage that has occurred, not a survey of what we can do to improve  the competitiveness of this industry in the future. That is the first point.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5494">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is this. At the election, what did this government say? It said it would keep this bounty to the end of the century, and it said that loudly and strongly to every computer manufacturer and to every manufacturer of component parts for information technology in this country. To every company that makes a washing machine, a car or a household appliance that has a smart chip in it, it said, `We will keep this bounty.' But what does this bill propose to do? After reconsideration, it proposes to chop it out from Monday. So the second point is the explicit breach of an election undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point relates to no consideration. The government says it needs the money. It has not considered the cost&hyphen;benefit analysis that taking this money will create in industry&mdash;the amount of unemployment, the inability to grow, the disruption to company planning or the strategic positioning of Australian companies against worldwide competition. It has not considered that. It is just a grab for the cash; it is not a consideration of industry needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other points, but I will conclude by saying that for those reasons the opposition, the Labor Party&mdash;and I want this to be clear&mdash;opposes the removal of those bounties. We believe the Senate, in its wisdom last time it considered these things, voted the right way, and we implore it to do so a second time.</PARA>

I think it was Ms Hanson who described the Prime Minister as never having managed much more than a suburban lawyer's backroom. I think he does exceptionally well for a lawyer with a suburban practice as his background. Nevertheless, my concern is that we have a weak and inexperienced government when it comes to management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can hear that in the way it responds to well&hyphen;known practical international mechanisms that are used by the largest organisations and the most professional governments and companies in the world. The process of cost&hyphen;benefit analysis or of any analysis of an issue means weighing up what the effects of one action are on a set of another actions. Every company and every government of any competence does just that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, because it is weak, inexperienced, incompetent and a poor manager, has persistently failed to do that. It has failed, and we have asked it again and again for analysis. We have no objections to&mdash;in fact we support&mdash;its balancing the books, but it is never able to say to us when we take $150 million from the computer bounty, for example, that the net benefit to Australia is greater than the loss, as any company would, as any organisation should and as any competent government would. This government is not able to say to Australia and to industry, `The effect on investments, jobs, growth, et cetera is the following&mdash;'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You respond by saying, `We cannot do a simple cost&hyphen;benefit analysis; it far too complex.' What do you think major companies do when they consider whether they should invest in some operation or not spend money  on others? As a government, you do not understand how condemned and how damned
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5495"> you are in the eyes of the community and in the eyes of industry by those kinds of statements, because people think, `My goodness, what sort of people are managing this economy?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that is the first part of the problem: you simply do not understand; it is tragic but you do not understand that all the Senate is saying to you is, `If you want to save the money on the computer bounty, tell us why it benefits Australia more than it will cost Australia.' You simply say, `We have got to balance the books.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go to the second problem. The second problem in the eyes of the world, and increasingly in the eyes of Australia, is that you are known as a government that does not honour its agreements and is not to be trusted&mdash;the Richard Nixons of Australia. Breach number one was your election promise. As Senator Cook has pointed out, you said you would keep the bounty until the end of the century and you are breaking that promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mining industry screamed at your breach of agreement on the DFR. They screamed&mdash;and I heard them during the hearing&mdash;that you had broken the agreement that you had made with them. The Asian countries screamed at your breach of agreement on the DIFF stuff. We all heard that. You breached the bounties agreements in the first place because it was a contractual obligation of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We understand that you arrived in government and said, `The books are in a worse state than we thought' and you have to save money. We have sympathised with that; the Senate has supported most of your intentions to balance the books. But on this issue we regard the cost as greater than the benefit so we have put a simple proposition to you: go away, finish your Goldsworthy report and come back and show us the evidence and do the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we move to the question of blackmail. You never said to the shipbuilding people when you renegotiated the bounty, `This renegotiation is conditional on the computer bounty saving.' You did not say that. So now, just because of a bit of a lack of management experience and ability, you want to compen
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sate with muscle. You want to come in here and muscle the Senate and say, `Well, we are going to blackmail you. You either give us this or we will take that away.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the ships bounty people are expecting you to honour their agreement. All we say to you as a government is that we expect that in time your inexperience will diminish; it has already. You are already making better decisions than you were a year ago.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the interim I do not think that it is very appropriate, say, to give the computer industry a blank cheque as to where is might or might not go, where its expertise might best be applied. In my view the government does have a point.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It appears that the House has agreed substantially to the amendment which was made to the bill in the Senate yesterday but has disagreed with the third point of the new subclause (n) to some extent, and that was the subject of some debate. It has included some  new words, and there is a need for some clarification in relation to those words.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5498">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I turn to the other matters that I was going to raise, I would like the parliamentary secretary to advise the committee whether the term `to improve the quality and range of aged care services' which appears under Roman numerals (iii) at the end of that passage should be taken to mean that the improvement can be to either the quality or the range or whether that must mean that there must be improvement to both the quality and the range of aged care services. It is important to understand where this amendment will take us in relation to the utilisation of the interest earned on accommodation bonds invested in accordance with the fiduciary requirements of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I indicate that the improvements which Labor proposed to the bill have, in many respects, been accepted by the House. The terminology which we used we still feel is better in that it is not potentially as limiting&mdash;and I look forward to the clarification of the matters that I raised. I am given to understand, however, that the Democrats will support this matter but they will no doubt clarify their position for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we will have arising from this position is an incentive to charge higher bonds. We say that was the position with the bill as it originally stood. It is possibly unavoidable. It will create not just a two-tiered system but a multi&hyphen;tiered system of care where higher bonds can be charged. The income from those bonds can be directed into the standard of care which is needed for those centres that can attract higher bonds, if this provision is to be applied, to have a greater quality and range of aged care services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also has another effect&mdash;and I question whether this is desirable&mdash;and that is to improve the capital value of nursing homes based upon the facility's ability to attract significant accommodation bonds. I suggest that it is inevitable that the track record of a facility in attracting accommodation bonds will be able to be factored into the value of that facility for the purposes of resale, thereby accruing a capital appreciation directly arising from this legislation. Perhaps I am wrong. I look forward to the comments from the parliamentary secretary in that regard. I look
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> forward to a response, particularly on the meaning of the combined terms and whether they are to be taken only in combination or whether they can be taken jointly and separately.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important that quality and range are put together, because if you just said quality as discrete from range then the range might not have any implied requirement of quality. The mix varies. You could increase your range and some aspect of that range might have more accent on quality than others, for instance, the paving of the driveway as compared to the ramp that I mentioned yesterday, or in relation to the physiotherapy services that are provided.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="656">Senator FORSHAW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have visited hostels and nursing homes, Senator Ellison, so I do have some understanding of them. You started to talk about driveways today. The point is that you belittle the issue. Let us understand what happened yesterday and what is happening today. Yesterday we put forward amendments, which the government opposed, particularly the proposal that was contained in our amendment here, which the government said was totally unnecessary. The proposal put forward was one which was clearly in line with all of the government's rhetoric on this bill. You have said from day one that there is a need to provide funds for capital improvement to improve the stock of nursing homes  in this country. That has been the argument put forward all along by the government as to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5499"> why this system of accommodation bonds was necessary and that the income that would be derived from accommodation bonds paid by residents of nursing homes would be directed to that end.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then sought to ensure that that was reflected in the legislation; that it was put into the legislation in no uncertain terms so that it would be clear to providers that that was to happen. We did not want there to be opportunities for nursing home providers who did not feel that they needed to do too much in the way of capital improvement&mdash;even though that is clearly what the accommodation bond income was for, and such improvement could be undertaken&mdash;to see this as a windfall for their nursing home facility, their company, particularly if it is a for profit company, to utilise such income for purposes other than what it is primarily intended for. Of course that could quite easily be directed towards providing higher standards of care for some residents who pay an accommodation bond than for concessional residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us be frank about it: once you have a system like that and you rely upon the market to drive it&mdash;that is what you are doing; you are relying on the market to drive this system; there is no cap and there is no specified amount as to what the bond should be; rather, it is all a matter of negotiation and dependent on the real estate market&mdash;it does create opportunities for nursing home providers to find ways to utilise this income for other than what it is primarily intended. As long as that is legal, there will be providers who will endeavour to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went to the trouble of constructing an amendment. We all recall we had a bit of discussion to find the appropriate words to reflect in the act that principle that you have said all along underpinned the provision of accommodation bonds. The government did not support it, but the Democrats did and it was carried by the Senate. Today it went back to the other place. You have accepted the Senate's amendment, except in so far as you have added some words into paragraph 3, which are the words that you have read out.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the government's amendment retains the broad principles that the opposition's amendment was based upon and that the Senate carried, it gives a clear indication to nursing homes providers out there&mdash;who may feel that they do not need to put any more of this income into capital improvement, but rather have a motivation to increase the income from the bonds they receive, to charge the highest possible bonds because they are private, profit&hyphen;making enterprises&mdash;that they can establish a two&hyphen;tier system of care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been saying all along that this is one of the dangers of your legislation, and what the government has done today sends that message out: if you are a nursing home provider and you are in the business of making a profit, you can set the highest possible bond that you believe you can recoup in the market. If, in particular, you are a facility that is of more recent construction and therefore probably not needing as much capital improvement, you are going to have a great opportunity here to divert that income into providing different and higher standards of care than might otherwise be provided to concessional residents in that home or, indeed, in other parts of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This a real recipe for leaving the side door open for that to occur. That is why the opposition believes, as has been expressed in the house today and in here today, that you really are still trying to keep that door open and send the signal, notwithstanding what you say the basic principle is that underpins the accommodation bond system: `Don't worry. If you want to use it to promote better standards of care so you can attract more wealthy people to pay higher bonds and, therefore, increase the profit, then you are quite able to do so.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position of the opposition is that we still believe that the amendment that we put forward is the better wording. It clearly sends the message out to the industry that the accommodation bonds are to be used for the purposes that the government has said all along they should be used for. We have said that that should be reflected in the act. The Senate agreed with that yesterday.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5500">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe the original wording was better. Now the government has come back with this wording. My understanding is that it is likely to be supported by other parties in the Senate. We are very concerned about the future because of the words that you have now sought to include in our original amendment and the way you have changed it. It is going to be on the government's head when we find out in a year or two a diverging standard of care in nursing homes across the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment, nevertheless, still retains essentially the elements that the opposition was seeking to have included in the legislation. So whilst we are not happy with, and certainly disagree with, the proposals from the government, at least it is better than the bill as it was when this government first introduced it into the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the Democrats agreed with the Labor Party amendment which had been altered and also with the words that were added at the last moment. I did not want to cut off the possibility that we might take up the intention of the additional words in the Labor amendment. That was why I indicated that I was prepared to give more time to consider the best wording and gave provisional agreement then to that going to the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats do agree with the wording which has come back from the House of Representatives for a number of reasons. It clearly indicates&mdash;as Labor and we wanted&mdash;that income derived from accommodation bonds et cetera will be used to meet capital works. That is the intention, but it does more than that. I think this is the important point because there are other words that have come back from the House of Representatives that I think strengthen it considerably. Those words are `to comply with matters specified in the certification principles for the purposes'. Those words translate an intention that the capital works et cetera should happen and give it a mechanism to make sure that it actually will happen. So it strengthens the amendment that the Labor Party had put in place. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think we ought to argue over whether or not the words should be `where no capital expenditure is required or likely to be required'. I think the words `where no capital expenditure is reasonably necessary' certainly give the same intention. The point is that that intention is very much strengthened by the words which I mentioned about compliance and the process whereby compliance will be ensured at least to the degree that that is ever humanly possible. I think the government has given us a mechanism that will not only pick up the intention of the Labor amendment but also ensure that it happens to the degree that anything is humanly ensured.</PARA>

The coalition intends proceeding with the second reading debate of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997, but we are awaiting a message in relation to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 from the House of Repre
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5501"> sentatives. We do hope that that will arrive before all of us race off to the airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is very keen to deal with the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). It contains a number of extremely important measures that will affect potentially thousands of people across Australia and, in particular, people who will benefit from the government's capital gains tax rollover provisions. It is, I admit, a complicated bill. It contains many other provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear from discussions held with a number of parties that it is impossible to get any sort of agreement on sitting later this afternoon, and I understand there are good reasons for that. The coalition appreciates&mdash;and I, as Manager of Government Business, appreciate&mdash;the very high level of cooperation we have had from senators in this place, particularly the Leader of the Opposition and the Manager of Opposition Business and his team. We have had discussions with the Greens and Democrats and other senators in relation to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). We had sought agreement to sit for a few extra hours this evening to deal with it so the benefits of that bill could be delivered, but no agreement could be reached. So clearly the government will have to list that bill as a matter of high priority in the coming sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I make those comments, I thank all senators for the contribution they have made to getting the government's program well advanced during the session. Even though many of the bills have taken a long time, we do realise that many senators have an interest in that. It has been a productive session from the government's point of view. We have dealt with a number of very contentious packages. We have brought them to a vote. We have had some long and thorough debates on some of those packages, but the government is happy that we have achieved, in large measure, the program we sought to achieve, with the rare exception of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are proposing to do is bring on the second reading debate of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). When the message arrives from our friends in the other

I do think we should deal with it before we finish, provided it is here before 3.45 p.m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), as has been mentioned, is an omnibus tax bill covering a wide number of areas&mdash;many of which were announced in the budget. The major matters include superannuation, capital gains tax and other tax issues. In respect of the superannuation changes, the legislation proposes to change the taxation arrangements for superannuation by, firstly, granting an exemption from capital gains tax for up to $500,000 for small businesses which use the money for retirement purposes; secondly, allowing a rebate at the rate of 18 per cent for superannuation contributions made on behalf of low income earners&mdash;that is, under $10,800 per year or non-working spouse; and, thirdly, increasing the maximum employee age under which superannuation guarantee payments must be made by employers from 65 to 70 to be consistent with the rights of employees to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5502"> continue to contribute to super funds until age 70.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has strong concerns about the equity of the first of these two proposals and unequivocally supports the third. The Senate has referred these issues to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation for examination. The committee has reported. We do not oppose these measures, but we will be moving some amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My next area in respect of this legislation is the small business exemption. We have concerns about the half a million dollar exemption purpose proposal which relates to the fairness of this measure. We accept that for many people their small business has been the way that they have saved for their retirement. For some people, business cash flow needs have precluded the capacity to save regularly in a superannuation fund. In addition, prior to Labor's reform of what are known as the reasonable benefit limits, RBLs, there was a significant bias against small business in superannuation in some circumstances, especially where the businesses were not incorporated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As usual, despite the rhetoric of the coalition, it was Labor that fixed the anomalies that confronted small business, not the coalition. Indeed, it was the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard), when he was the responsible minister, who presided over many of the unfair aspects of superannuation in the taxation system, which Labor reformed in its 13 years in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there has been a problem historically. It is by no means clear whether significant further large concessions are justified. Tax, albeit at concessional rates, is payable on superannuation contributions, fund earnings and the final benefits of ordinary employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill proposes to completely exempt from tax a substantial capital gain&mdash;half a million dollars&mdash;on condition only of the age of the recipient and the funds being used for retirement purposes. This provides a very significant advantage in tax terms between small business people and the great bulk of the Australian community who are employees. There was some comment earlier today in the context of another debate that the average
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> superannuation fund balance at the moment is $38,000. I think we have to contrast the position here with the government providing a significant concession of half a million dollars to small business in the event of rollover into superannuation, and the debate that occurred here earlier in relation to the government's approach to deeming the superannuation assets of persons who reach 55 if they are on a social security unemployment or disability pension. There does seem to be a significant contrast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would certainly submit to the Senate that that deeming provision&mdash;I have referred to it as a vicious measure, which is what it is; a vicious measure&mdash;stands in contrast to the way in which small business is to be treated. It provides a significant advantage in tax terms between small business people and the great bulk of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, $38,000 is the average amount in superannuation accounts. The tax advantage that is being conferred here to small business is 13 times the size of the average superannuation account balance which is proposed to be exempt from tax, whereas the much smaller sum has already faced taxation and will probably face further taxation when it is paid out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can post the question: why shouldn't equivalent taxation regimes apply to both employees and to small business? Why is it proposed that the rules will disproportionately favour one group of Australians over the other? Certainly I have not seen a cogent rationale from the government, other than purely political rhetoric. Again, that is in a similar vein to the sort of political rhetoric we dealt with yesterday in respect of the exemption of small business from unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another relevant fact to consider in assessing the merits of this proposal is that, by definition, this exemption only applies to those assets which are covered by the capital gains tax; that is, any asset acquired by a small business person prior to 20 September 1985 is exempt from capital gains tax anyway. So, we do not believe that it is correct to imply that the current law disproportionately discriminates against small business propri
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5503"> etors who have spent their life building a business. Any proceeds from the sale of a longstanding business will be exempt from capital gains tax. In addition, when Labor was in office we instituted a benefit for small business, namely, a 50 per cent exemption from capital gains tax on goodwill up to the value of $21 million, which currently applies under the current capital gains tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me stress we have had an open mind on this issue. But we wish to ensure that where the government is presenting a fair measure&mdash;as, indeed, we did in respect of tax law No.1&mdash;we do not allow rorting by the top end of town which could become available to a small number of people and not available to the many. In saying that, I am certainly not suggesting that rorting should be available to the many; it should not be available to anyone. This concession must also be considered in the context of the capital gains tax rollover relief proposal which we have just dealt with. I assume we will be receiving a message very shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two measures&mdash;the measure we are discussing here and the capital gains tax rollover relief proposal which the Senate has dealt with and is awaiting a message from the House&mdash;are further significant relaxation of an important part of the tax system. Again, Labor is not opposed to clearing away unfair taxation hurdles or amending provisions which impact negatively on jobs or growth. But, that said, this&mdash;together with the measure in tax laws No. 1&mdash;will be a very significant change in the comprehensiveness of the tax base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would submit that the coalition has always opposed the fairest measures in our tax system, such as capital gains tax, and has, in the past, wished to repeal it. Contemporary community attitudes, we believe, would preclude full repeal of the measure. Consequently, Labor is wary of attempts to effectively repeal the measures for certain sections of the community via a backdoor means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to make some comments in respect of the superannuation spouse rebate&mdash;the 18 per cent rebate for superannuation contributions made on behalf of a low income or non&hyphen;working spouse. Again, the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senate committee looked at this measure carefully. What is interesting about this measure, what is instructive about the focus of this measure, is that it assumes that people will have a spare $3,000 to contribute to their spouse's superannuation in situations where the spouse does not work or only works part time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, we saw this approach illustrated in the savings rebate initiative recently announced in the budget. With respect to superannuation, it assumes that there is going to be a massive incentive created for persons to place money into superannuation accounts. In the case of superannuation, to obtain the massive incentive rebate of $450 you would have to place $3,000 in a superannuation account. Labor certainly does not believe that low and middle income earners have that level of spare cash on an annual basis in order to avail themselves of the $450 rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measure we are looking at here is the 18 per cent superannuation spouse rebate. In practice, this measure will really only benefit those relatively few people we regard as well off. It is not going to benefit middle and lower income Australians. When the Prime Minister talks about helping families he is talking about assisting those families with plenty of money and plenty of investment options. I would submit to the Senate that he is not interested in helping the battlers who really need and would materially benefit from being able to save more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next measure I would like to make some comments on concerns capital gains tax. I would like to briefly mention a number of the changes to the CGT arrangements. The changes involve clarifying the rules about CGT on inherited property, including increasing the tax&hyphen;free period to dispose of the house from one year to two and reducing the record keeping requirements presently applicable, and enacting anti-avoidance rules covering manipulation of company liquidations and the elimination of anomalies in the loss provisions, both capital and revenue. These measures are reasonable and are not opposed by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments recognise that anomalies can arise where a principal residence is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5504"> inherited and subsequently disposed of and  the consequent need for a more flexible regime covering these types of transactions. The need for the anti-avoidance provisions shows precisely why Labor is concerned about the exemption for retirement purposes that I discussed previously. Aggressive tax planning is a fact of life and constant vigilance is needed to keep the tax base sound. Labor supports the government's measures to tighten the capital gains net to address these loss and liquidation problems. Whilst Labor is committed to closing down these inadvertent holes in the tax system which allow the smart few to benefit at the cost of many, we are naturally equally concerned that gaping holes are not deliberately inserted in the tax net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now refer to a number of other matters in this legislation. The bill also contains supposed anti-avoidance amendments under the research and development provisions which seek to amend the partnership provisions to ensure companies in partnership cannot effectively continue syndicate&hyphen;like operations which the government cancelled from July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also provides for the disallowance of deductions for syndicates where the syndicate has been granted an extension but has breached a condition of that extension. Labor does not support the R&amp;D changes which have necessitated the proposals in this bill. They are bad for jobs, growth and innovation. The amendments are necessary to fix anomalies in legislation accepted by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) last year and which was known at the time to be flawed. My colleague Senator Cook will make some remarks with respect to the R&amp;D issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also in this legislation payments received under the firearms surrender arrangements are to be confirmed as tax exempt for recipients other than gun dealers. I have Senator Bob Collins sitting next to me during my speech in this debate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With that important exception that Senator Collins brought to the attention of the Senate, the proposal is not controversial and that certainly will not be opposed by Labor. The gun buyback was a tough but necessary measure which has had the full support of the opposition. Property was compulsorily acquired from citizens, compensation was properly payable and was paid. It would have been unfair to tax farmers or other gun owners in respect of a disposal that they did not undertake voluntarily and hence we support this amendment. Similarly, the opposition agrees with the government's decision to exclude firearm dealers from this concession.</PARA>

Housing fringe benefits provided by primary producers in remote areas are exempt from FBT from 1 April 1997. Certain items used in telephone exchanges will not be considered to be electrical fittings and, hence, will not be exempt from wholesale sales tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) deals with a number of tax matters, most of which are not contentious, and I intend speaking only on a limited number of them. The bill seeks to extend the capital gains tax rollover relief to retirement, allowing up to $500,000 of net capital gains to be rolled into superannuation when a small business person leaves the work force, and any rollover amount included in superannuation by the person will be counted towards the person's reasonable benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation requested the government to provide modelling on whether this measure would raise retirement savings or not and the government has failed so far to provide that evidence. The argument for concessional tax treatment of retirement savings is to increase retirement savings. As the OECD correctly points out, a tax incentive for saving should only be approved if the increase in savings exceeds the cost of taxation. Because the government has not provided the modelling, we do not know with respect to this particular case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure will cost $45 million a year by 1999&hyphen;2000 but will it raise retirement savings by a greater amount? We just do not know the answer to that question. The Democrats concede that many small business people do use their business as a retirement savings vehicle. Tax concessions need to be restructured, however, to increase retirement savings&mdash;we should not just hand out tax concessions willy&hyphen;nilly for people doing what they would have done anyway. The Democrats would support a well&hyphen;targeted tax incentive for small business people to save more for retirement but the question, as I say, is whether this incentive is well targeted or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This concession will exempt completely from capital gains tax the first $500,000 of net capital gains if that is used for retirement savings. The argument that small business
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5506"> people do not receive any concessions if they save through the family business is not quite correct. For a start, capital gains tax is fully indexed for inflation, published in Treasury's annual tax expenditure statement. PAYE taxpayers do not have the benefit of such  indexations on their gross salaries or on their non&hyphen;superannuation savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Second, many taxpayers are able to use the structure of their family business, especially trusts and company structures, to tax plan their overall taxable income downwards. Many deductions which are not available to PAYE taxpayers are available to business taxpayers. So, overall, they often end up paying a lot less tax over their lifetimes than PAYE taxpayers, and the final value of the business includes many tax advantages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amount of $500,000 of capital gains is an awful lot of capital gains, because to get $500,000 of capital gains indexed for inflation with all the cost base adjustments that are available you are talking about an asset with a value of $1 million to $3 million. That is how much they will have available to them for retirement income. We have to ask about the comparisons made with benefits available to other taxpayers and the kinds of tax concessions which are already there for these people to save for their retirement. The Labor Party has proposed reducing the value of the concession to $250,000. Again, that is a lot of capital gains, probably reflecting a business with a value of up to $2 million. But we think the move by Labor is a step in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also deals with prospectors' mining rights and corrects some unintended aspects of amendments which were moved last year in the Senate by my colleague Senator Murray. We will be supporting those amendments. I understand that the Labor Party is also moving to introduce a five&hyphen;year sunset clause on these provisions, an amendment with which we also have some sympathy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third measure I will mention briefly is the proposed fringe benefits tax incentive for remote area housing for primary producers&mdash;which is, in fact, a $20 million gift to the National Party. At present, remote area housing enjoys an exemption from FBT only to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the value of 50 per cent of the benefit. This exemption seeks to extend that to 100 per cent, but only for on&hyphen;farm accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about all the other workers in remote areas subject to fringe benefits tax: state public servants, teachers, nurses, police? These people all still only enjoy a 50 per cent benefit, even though they are usually compulsorily transferred to remote areas. Bank employees, rail employees, mining employees: their employers still pay 50 per cent fringe benefits tax. When we have a minister here once more to answer questions on this, I would ask: why does this government care more about farming workers, and why is it prepared to act in a slightly discriminatory way against non-farming workers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth measure I wish to mention is the increase in the age limit for superannuation contributions. The Democrats support this. We have long campaigned to remove age discrimination in employment at both ends, the junior and the senior. This measure will remove discrimination against workers aged between 65 and 70 who want to keep working. These amendments will ensure that they get their full superannuation entitlements as a worker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifth measure I wish to mention briefly is the R&amp;D tax concession for partnerships. This amendment follows on from a successful Democrat amendment to the government's bill to close down the R&amp;D tax concession for syndicates to exclude partnerships. Although the government failed to substantiate its claim that syndication was heavily rorted, it did establish, in our view, a case that syndication may not have been the most appropriate or cost&hyphen;effective method of promoting research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This, combined with the fact that the government introduced the Start program for research and development as a replacement, and introduced transitional arrangements to cater for applications already in the pipeline, was the reason for the Democrats' support. This bill gives full effect to the Senate's December amendment, and we expect to support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final matter I wish to address is the proposed rebate for superannuation contribu
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5507"> tions made on behalf of a low income or non-working spouse. This measure proposes a tax rebate of up to 18 per cent for the first $3,000 of contributions. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The subject of my speech will, I guess, soon return to the front pages of the newspapers where, until just recently, it occupied a prominent position almost every day of the week. I am of course referring to the native title debate and, more specifically, to the exposure draft of the amendments to the legislation which were released earlier today. These amendments will be introduced into the other place early in the next parliamentary session and are likely to be debated in this chamber later in the year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a member of the parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title, I look forward to taking part in the community consultations on the legislation which are also scheduled for the spring session. A few weeks ago, again as
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a member of the committee, I was privileged to visit a number of islands in the Torres Strait, including the island of Mer, the home and final resting place of Eddie Mabo whose name has been popularly attached to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past two weeks there have been extensive briefings on the draft legislation with the backbench committee, pastoralists, miners, resource development agencies, Aboriginal groups and, of course, other interested parties. The exposure draft of amendments released today represents a significant step in the delivery of an election promise to fix the extensive problems that exist with the current Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is five years since the original Mabo judgment and three years since the Native Title Act was passed. Even the Australian Labor Party has agreed that the legislation requires amendment, and in fact today's exposure draft contains a number of amendments which were originally presented to the parliament by the previous government. Everybody who has had contact with the present legislation agrees that it requires amendment&mdash;even the lawyers, who have arguably been the group that has benefited most from this act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court's discovery in late 1992 that native title was a valid and recognisable form of land title, and that generations of eminent lawyers and jurists had apparently overlooked that it had been sleeping beneath us for 200 years, threw into turmoil what had been an established form and settled system of land tenure and property law. It was an earth&hyphen;shattering discovery which has had profound effects around this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, while the Native Title Act has proven to be a financial bonanza for lawyers, it has not done much for the Aborigines and, I might say, Madam Deputy President, it has done very little for the residents of the island of Mer who told us of the confusion and disappointment that, since native title had been discovered on their island, they had actually waited for something to substantially change, but of course it had not because it simply confirmed what they had believed all along.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5509">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, today on the Australian mainland not one square inch has been found by law to exist anywhere in Australia, although one agreement was recently struck for a development in northern New South Wales where compensation paid for alleged&mdash;but not established&mdash;extinguishment was 50 per cent above the market value of the freehold land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the Native Title Tribunal has been established, literally millions and millions of dollars have been spent on this very expensive bureaucratic structure. So far, all that really has been created is an administrative and legal nightmare. The latest tribunal annual report reveals that there are 18 tribunal members, 160 staff and registry officers in six capital cities around Australia. More importantly, it has before it negotiation and mediation of more than 450 land claims around this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The total cost of this cumbersome bureaucracy is $20 million a year, and staff costs increased from about $2.5 million in 1994&hyphen;95 to more than $6.3 million in the following year. At the same time, travel for these staff almost doubled in the course of one year to more than $1.2 million. And still not an inch of native title has yet been legally found to exist. Surely this is a well&hyphen;established case that something has to change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the 10&hyphen;point plan which is embodied in the draft legislation that has been released by the government today is absolutely crucial in unravelling this costly and quite unworkable mess. In particular, the proposed legislation seeks to overcome the uncertainty in relation to pastoral leases caused by the operation of the existing provisions of the Native Title Act in conjunction with the very complex Wik decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The draft legislation released today is designed to provide legal validity for acts carried out between the commencement of the Native Title Act in January 1994 and the Wik decision on the assumption that pastoral leases and other tenures that were existing at the time extinguished native title. The new legislation will provide certainty to pastoralists that they can continue to carry on their primary production activities. It provides respect for
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> native title, preserving the principles of native title as established in the Mabo case, and allows the claims to proceed. It provides confirmation of the common law relating to native title and, in particular, that it has been extinguished by current and historical freehold residential leases, commercial leases, and those agricultural and pastoral leases providing exclusive possession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It provides that impediments to the development of municipal services in towns and cities should be minimised and that government powers to manage and regulate water should be put beyond doubt. It provides workability through removing impediments to development; builds on the government's proposed amendments to improve the processes of the Native Title Act 1993, and, importantly, it provides devolution to the states and territories in particular to allow alternative state and territory processes for granting mining titles on pastoral lease land. It offers a speedy and sustainable resolution of concerns and uncertainty, and, very importantly, the new legislation enables the right to renew mining leases without triggering the right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Native title is crucial in my own state of South Australia. A number of properties in our state presently have overlapping claims from different Aboriginal groups. Overall, while there are just over 16,000 Aborigines in South Australia, about 65 per cent of the state is under claim&mdash;much of it in the newly discovered resource&hyphen;rich Gawler Craton in the north.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation package released today does not&mdash;I repeat `not'&mdash;abolish native title. It retains and respects the concept of native title and primarily proposes changes to the administrative regime created by the Native Title Act to administer native title claims. The package will address much of the dismay and confusion that has greeted the Wik decision, particularly by members of the resource and pastoral industries all over this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say how disappointed I was just yesterday to see one of the Aboriginal leaders move so quickly to denigrate the government's attempts to restore equity and fairness to this act. I do hope we can look forward to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5510"> a more constructive approach as the legislation is debated in this place and as the statutory committee undertakes its consultations around this country. This issue is too important to approach on a partisan basis. It has to be approached in a way that will bring this country together to end the division and the  unfairness and to restore fairness and equity to all of those affected by it.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5510"><TITLE>Whistleblowing

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council of the University of Technology, Sydney debated the introduction of upfront fees today. I am pleased to see that they have been rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some Senators, and certainly many students, will recall the occupation of the UTS chancellery over the Easter weekend this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The actions of these students, in protesting against the introduction of the most regressive measure in the Coalition's Higher education policy, has been successful, and I congratulate them for having the courage to take a stand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They took this action so that future generations will not be subject to a higher education system where there are first and second class students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where, as the Minister's department has now admitted, entire classes may be for upfront fee paying students only.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where specialisation in degrees, such as corporate law, may be only available to the wealthy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a pilot's course may offer as "optional" the flying component of the courses, and where the HECS students will only be able to have a `second class' education.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 25 per cent of enrolments safeguard that the Minister assured the Senate would protect HECS liable students will not apply to specific subjects, it will only apply to the course as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that the Minister still has time to make amends for this oversight, and I hope that she and her Coalition colleagues are shamed into doing so. If this matter is not addressed then the future of university education looks very bleak.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, once again, I welcome the news tonight that the University of Technology, Sydney will not introduce upfront fees next year. It is a glimmer of hope in a higher education sector currently sliding down the slippery slope of user pays.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is ironic that the institution where Minister Vanstone received her degree, Adelaide University, began their slide towards full user pays when the Adelaide University Council agreed to the introduction of upfront fees just over a week ago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the few things that I have in common with the Minister is our time spent at Adelaide University.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While my time on campus was spent fighting the HEAC and then the HECS, the Minister did not pay tuition fees for during her time at Adelaide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I feel that if the Minister had experienced the turmoil and anger of students towards fees for education then she would understand just what a disincentive the Labor party and now the Coalition have created for those Australians who just cannot afford the fees or the debt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If she had seen fellow students forced to reassess their studies in light of the financial burden then she may have a different perspective on the Coalition's policy directions today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that Adelaide University did not overwhelmingly embrace the idea of charging upfront fees. That the vote was tied, and that the Chancellor's additional casting vote was required to enable the fees. I note also the convention of meeting procedure to use a casting vote to uphold the status quo, and that this convention was not applied on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also congratulate the students, and members of Adelaide University Council who voted against upfront fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Upfront fees are fees, which the Vice Chancellor, Mary O'Kane states publicly that she opposes ideologically. But she also states that there is no option left to Adelaide University in the face of the Coalition's savage Budget cuts over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the anger that the students demonstrated at the recent protests against the introduction of upfront fees at Adelaide University was directed to the choice of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs' recent address to the Law and Performing Arts graduation ceremony.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5511"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How the Minister has the gall to front up at what should be a celebration for those students escapes me. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister seems oblivious to the havoc that the budget cuts have had on campus.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wonder if she was aware that the Performing Arts graduates had just lost their department. Staff had been dismissed and their classmates and the first and second years students in that degree were being shunted into another faculty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the students were deeply upset by choice of the Minister as the speaker at the ceremony. A large proportion did not applaud at the end of her speech, and the graduands wore blue ribbons on their gowns in protest. For many their memories of the day were clouded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only reference in the Minister's speech which could be construed as in any way related to those graduands from the Performing Arts was a few lines taken from a song by the Crash Test Dummies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But this oblivion to the plight of universities is not new, with a stream of insensitive comments such as the one that students were "squealing like stuck pigs" and that universities "are in clover", students were not really expecting that the Minister would be aware that she had been responsible for the closure of their department, that of the performing arts at Adelaide University.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As usual the Minister was quick yesterday to point out that the majority of university students come from wealthy backgrounds. She was very quick to point out that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These findings came from the results of Dobson and Birrell survey of Monash University first year students. What the Minister neglected to mention yesterday was the further findings of the survey, the findings that the restriction of access to AUSTUDY and the Means test bungling was impeding the participation of students from lower socio economic backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This week the South Australian Farmers Federation issued a media release to state their belief that the Coalition has failed in its election promise to improve access to AUSTUDY for farming families, that "The Minister hasn't gone far enough. It's time to go to the heart of the issue and that's to right the wrongs in the Actual means test which, frankly, do not cater for the farming family".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contrary to the Minister's claims that the AUSTUDY changes announced in the Federal budget would appease the farmers, they are going on the warpath.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SA Farmers Federation have lost faith in this Minister, and they realise that the only reason that any concessions have been made over the entire AUSTUDY Means test debacle have not arisen because the Minister has any spirit of fairness, they have happened because the Democrats, the opposition and the Minister's own Party have forced her to back down.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now June, I am still receiving complaints from a significant number of students that they have yet to be
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reassessed since the bungling that occurred earlier this year. This is an outrage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is little wonder that politicians have even dropped in the polls of trustworthiness to below that of the retail agents of second hand motor vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recently, in keeping with that image, we had the Minister for Education, Senator Vanstone, touting a HECS university education as akin to a used commodore.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, we have a federal politician trying to raise the respect and trust accorded her profession by comparing it to that of the proverbial used car salesman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You can imagine the patter in the car yard of higher education, "It's a lovely little run around, four year degree. Note the sandstone trimming and the $100,000 price tag. If that's out of your range there's a $30,000 arty number. Used to be a CAE but you'd never know. . . Don't worry if you can't pass the driving test, at the right price we can get you behind the wheel" et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With her assertions that we should ignore the falling application rates and concentrate only on the final enrolment numbers, or that universities already have a few extra seats and the lights are on so an extra 20 won't be much of a burden. Even though staff are being retrenched, and those that are left are already overworked.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With misleading advertising like that, one has to ask, "Would you buy a uni degree off this Minister?"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I find most distressing is that these changes to higher education came from a government which had travelled the campuses of the country assuring university students and staff that the Coalition recognised the constant underfunding and overcrowding on campus.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They came from a government which, when in opposition, assured students that they would not reduce access to AUSTUDY, and that the HECS system would be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Young people, betrayed by both Labor and Liberal, aren't as concerned about a double dissolution election as their double disillusionment with the major parties.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5511"><TITLE>Antarctica</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This year marks the jubilee of Australia's National  Antarctic Research Expeditions. The jubilee year commemorates 50 years of Australia's involvement in the Antarctic region. It began with the first ANARE voyage in 1947 to establish the station at the isolated Southern Ocean outpost of Heard Island. A few months later, Macquarie Island station was established. Australia established Mawson, the first
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5512"> of its three stations on continental Antarctica, in 1954.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Saturday night, I had the honour and privilege, in my capacity as parliamentary secretary with responsibility for the Antarctic, to attend the jubilee midwinter dinner in Hobart at which the Minister for the Environment, Senator Robert Hill, delivered the principal address. The previous night, I was privileged as well to attend the Melbourne ANARE Club's annual dinner, which was their special one this year because it was the jubilee celebration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Saturday night, while we were celebrating in Hobart, jubilee celebrations were also being held at midwinter dinners in Australia's Antarctic bases at Mawson, Davis, Casey and Macquarie Island. As well, centres throughout Australia that have ANARE clubs&mdash;that is, clubs of previous ANARE expeditioners&mdash;will be celebrating the jubilee during this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At Hobart we had the traditional calling of the years where, starting with 1997, each set of winterers and summerers stood when their year was called. It was pleasing to note that in both Hobart and Melbourne, in each case with an exception of one year, there were representatives from each of Australia's expeditions to the Antarctic in each of the years. It was very pleasing to have at both functions Dr Phillip Law, the first director of Australia's Antarctic Division, and a well&hyphen;known and well&hyphen;respected Antarctic explorer and expedition leader. Dr Law is now getting on in years but is still as sharp and as bright and as keen on the Antarctic as he has ever been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ANARE is the men and women who have travelled to the Antarctic and the sub&hyphen;Antarctic with Australian government expeditions since 1947. From the very early times of ANARE's history the expeditioners have endured winters at Australian stations, and they have had to be very special people. They have kept the stations functioning and programs operating through the darkness of winter, cut off completely from the outside world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is now unquestionably an international leader in Antarctic affairs. As a result
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of our presence in the Antarctic, Australia has gained considerable international recognition and respect, has made significant contributions to Antarctic scientific research and has maintained a standard of operations that other international Antarctic programs measure themselves against. Australia's achievements are a direct result of the professionalism, courage, determination and commitment of our expeditioners. It is also probably significant that, in this jubilee year as well, the AAP Mawson's Hut Foundation is starting work on the restoration and preservation of Mawson's original huts on the Antarctic continent constructed during his epic 1911&hyphen;1914 expedition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In proposing the toast to ANARE at the Hobart dinner, I drew attention to the fact that in celebrating ANARE we should recognise not just the expeditioners who go to the Antarctic but many other people. We acknowledge the partners and families of the expeditioners whose contribution to Australia's program is measured in the months, and sometimes years, spent at home without partners, fathers and mothers. Indeed, we as a nation owe our thanks to those who remain behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, our expeditions would not be possible without the tremendous support given by the Australian Antarctic Division in Hobart, particularly by the current director, Mr Rex Moncur, and his staff, who have put so much personal effort, often well beyond the call of duty, into supporting the expedition members and their programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, we need to recognise and thank all those semi-official and private groups and individuals who in various ways have supported the ANARE cause over the years, again often well beyond the call of duty. The Saturday night dinner was sponsored by two of our better supporters, Apple Computers  Australia and the Marine Board of Hobart. We are indeed indebted to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this category I should also mention Mr Tim Bowden, the very well&hyphen;known broadcaster and commentator who was commissioned by the Australian government to write the history of Australia's Antarctic expeditions in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5513"> a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Silence Calling</EMPHASIS>, which I had the honour of launching at the National Press Club earlier in June. Mr Bowden has become a major publicist for Australia's efforts in the Antarctic, and in addition to his many other considerable attributes he is now well regarded as one of Australia's most significant Antarctic historians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally we have to acknowledge the way that other national and international groups affiliated in some way with the Australian program over the years have cooperated with us. Our program does not operate alone in the Antarctic and, as we have learned over the years, there are many instances of support for other national programs for ships in trouble or for sick or injured expeditioners and the like. Through cooperation with other Antarctic nations in the various Antarctic forums we have received considerable benefit and we, of course, support them as they support us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The men and women of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions have done Australia proud by their efforts over the past 50 years.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Productivity Commission is due to report on the TCF industry early next week, the question is whether the tariff protections scheduled to fall in accordance with the Asia Pacific Economic Co&hyphen;operation forum's free trade targets will be maintained, or whether the TCF industry, as with the automotive industry, can justify a pause in tariff reductions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To address these questions, it is worth recounting a few historical facts underlying recent tariff reform in the TCF industry.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the late 1980s parts of the industry received protection equal to tariff rates in excess of 130 per cent. In 1993, the Labor government's industry statement put in place a tariff reduction program which is scheduled to carry through the year 2000. At that time, the maximum TCF tariff will be 25 per cent on apparel and certain finished textiles.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5514"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The TCF industry flourished in Australia until the early 1970s. In 1974, the Labor government imposed a 25 per cent tariff cut at a time when wages had exploded. The subsequent currency revaluation had a drastic effect on competitiveness in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This in turn induced a flood of imports and the industry contracted. It is estimated that between 1972&hyphen;73 and 1977&hyphen;78 approximately 1,300 (32 per cent) of factories closed and 50,000 (30 per cent) of employees found themselves without a job.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1989 Labor instituted a TCF plan, designed to run until 1995, a feature of which was the removal of the quota system. In 1991, however, Labor revisited its plan, opting to accelerate the rate of protection reduction and to extend the plan beyond 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The move to lower tariff protection coincided with a severe downturn in demand and cemented further rises in imports and job losses. Between 1987&hyphen;88 and 1993&hyphen;94, factory employment fell by 32 per cent, overall employment fell by 20 per cent and manufacturing output fell by 24 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the tariff rate was systematically reduced, our balance of trade in TCF goods declined. Between 1990&hyphen;91 and 1995&hyphen;96, the trade deficit in TFC goods increased by almost $400 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As with other manufacturing industries, these policy decisions also oversaw the loss of jobs. Between 1984 and 1996, industry employment fell from over 123,000 to just 102,700.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was against that background, that in 1996, the government undertook to review the current industry assistance arrangements, with a reference to the Productivity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While no doubt the usual arguments will be made that cutting tariffs will make firms more efficient, productive and make jobs more secure and benefit consumers in the long run, those in the industry argue for more measured progress towards trade liberalisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not unreasonably, industry advocates point to efforts already being made to restructure and increase exports. Over the last 10 years the industry increased its exports from around $200 million of its turnover to over $1 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the most frequent claims made in protection debates is that it is not a level playing field&mdash;that many countries have implemented specific trade barriers aimed at Australian products attempting to compete in their markets and that our tariff barriers should not fall unless our trading partners reduce their own barriers to approximately the same extent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the move to free trade is to be encouraged it is argued that Australia should not keep to the timetable in isolation&mdash;that unilateral tariff disarmament is a recipe for disaster. While that may be, the announcement of New Zealand's commitment to tariff reduction in accordance

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The future of the Import Credit Scheme, resourced until the year 2000 is also a cause of concern in the industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting President, as I rise to make perhaps the last speech of this session, may I congratulate you on the opportunity you have been given through the President's absence to be Acting President. I am sure that all senators agree that, since your election and certainly since the election of  Madam President herself, this chamber has been in very good hands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I rise to make another speech on the issue of the proposed Holsworthy airport. As senators know, I have made many speeches on this important issue but I feel that I have to rise again today at the close of this session because by the time we come back to this parliament in August it is likely that a draft decision will have been made on the site for Sydney's second airport. I have been endeav
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5515"> ouring to find out from the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), from the Department of Transport and Regional Development, from the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories and indeed the EIS consultants when the draft EIS will be released publicly but nobody seems to be able to give us a date. We were told some time ago that it was likely to be handed down in March. We were subsequently told that it is  likely to be in July or even early August. We await that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are over 500,000 people in the southern Sydney region awaiting that EIS with trepidation because clearly this government, not withstanding the minister's comments that the government favours the Badgerys creek site, is setting Holsworthy up to be the site for Sydney's second airport. Everything points to that conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As I said before, this government is guilty of the grossest deception upon the people of southern Sydney, particularly the people of the electorate of Hughes, because the government never had the courage, never had the guts to tell the people before the last election that they planned to give them an airport at Holsworthy. They left it until after the election to make that announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wish to respond to some comments by the current member for Hughes, Mrs Danna Vale, who spoke in the other place on 2 June. In her speech in the adjournment debate on 2 June, Mrs Vale attacked the local state member for Bulli, Mr Ian McManus, and also made some reference to me and a speech that I made in this chamber on 15 May. Mr McManus made a speech in the state parliament on 14 May in which he stood up for his state electorate. I point out to the chamber that I live in the area and Mr McManus also lives in his electorate. When she was elected to the seat of Hughes, Mrs Vale did not even live in the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mrs Vale attacked us because we exposed how she had endeavoured to mislead the community about a public meeting held on 30 April in Engadine. She claimed in her speech that she had never been invited to that meeting. She was referring, of course, to correspondence that I had tabled in this parliament.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It was correspondence she had sent to residents in the area after the public meeting on 30 April indicating to the residents that she had never been invited to that public meeting held in opposition to the Holsworthy airport. She did not attend that meeting. She sent along a representative, as I pointed out in my speech. Her representative got up at the meeting and spoke on her behalf and never once indicated to the 2,000 people there that the member had not been invited. Rather, her spokesperson indicated that the member was unable to attend that evening because of a prior engagement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, that is evidence that the member, Mrs Vale, knew the meeting was on, would have had an opportunity to attend and had been invited to attend&mdash;as had other local representatives such as myself, as the duty senator for the seat of Hughes and also living in the very suburb where the meeting was held; as had Mr McManus, the state member; and as had other local representatives from community groups and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, after the meeting for some reason, Mrs Vale panicked. She obviously felt that her non-attendance at that meeting was going to cause her some problems. She wrote to residents in addressed letters&mdash;I tabled the letter I received as a resident&mdash;saying that she had never been invited in the first place. When I spoke on this matter in this chamber, I tabled a letter from Mrs Vale to Mr McManus which had been sent before the meeting was even held in which she thanked him for his invitation to attend the meeting in the first place and indicated her inability to attend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mrs Vale stood up in the parliament on 2 June and tried to assert that she was never  invited. She made some very harsh comments about the local state member. For instance, she claims that she has been defamed, that false witness has been borne against her and that she is going to meet Mr McManus in another place at an undetermined time and she will charge him with bearing false witness. I do not hold anything personally against Mrs Vale. I have met her on a number of occasions at various functions and I do not mind having a chat to her. However, she is trying
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5516"> to pretend that she is an innocent, naive person, as she claims in her speech, and that she has somehow been the subject of a political attack. There is a difference between claiming that and the reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is this. Mrs Vale was the candidate for the Liberal Party at the last election. She ran on a campaign attacking the former Labor government and the former local member. For instance, she referred to local issues such as the Woronora River bridge. She promised her electorate that, when she got into federal office, she would deliver them a bridge over the Woronora River, clearly a state only issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did she do? She has not got us the bridge. We are still waiting for the bridge. But what we are going to get is an airport, something that is going to cause devastation to the lives of 500,000 people. Not only that, Mrs Vale has condemned the Labor Party locally.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those who do not learn from the mistakes of the past are doomed to repeat them. I wish to speak on the matter of salinity and rural sustainability in Western Australia. In particular, I want to address the new Western Australian state government initiative known as the salinity action plan which was launched just prior to the recent Western Australian state election. The plan is being held up by the state government as the blueprint for reversing the serious decline in agricultural lands and waters in Western Australia resulting from increasing salinisation. According to the government, the salinity plan will involve the expenditure of a total of $3 billion over the next 30 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will state at the outset that much of the plan, at least in terms of its stated objectives, is commendable and necessary. Much genuine concern has gone into preparing the plan. Some of the hoped for outcomes, if achieved, will be very beneficial to the Western Australian community and environment. However, I do want to make some criticisms of the plan and the thinking that underlies it, because of my profound concern that the plan is at risk of turning out to be yet another chapter in a long history of ill-considered, headline grab bing initiatives that end up being not just hollow but fundamentally counterproductive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concerns can be summed up by the old adage that those who do not learn from the mistakes of the past are doomed to repeat them. It is well understood that Western Australia's agricultural region is in the midst of a major sustainability crisis. It must be stressed that salinisation is just one symptom
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5517"> of this sustainability crisis. According to various reports, Western Australia has over 70 per cent of Australia's dry land salinity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An estimated 1.8 million hectares of farmland are already salt affected, and this amounts to 10 per cent of the region's cleared farmland. It is believed that this figure could increase by 300 per cent to 6.1 million hectares in future decades. The underlying cause of salinisation is the clearing of the original deep&hyphen;rooted perennial native vegetation and its replacement by shallow&hyphen;rooted annual pasture species. Because of the removal of the original vegetation, water usage patterns and watertable dynamics have been radically altered, resulting in rising ground water levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the ground water rises it brings to the surface salt deposits that exist naturally in the soils of the region. This salt then concentrates on or near the soil surface, killing vegetation and rendering large areas virtually unusable. The effects of increasing salinisation are felt throughout the south&hyphen;west, with creeks, rivers, lakes and wetlands all becoming saline. It is estimated that 18 million hectares of land in the south&hyphen;west have been cleared of their native vegetation, primarily for agricultural production, out of a total of 25 million hectares. That is 72 per cent. This in itself is an ecological disaster, aside from its consequences in terms of salinisation and other chronic problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As mentioned previously, salinisation itself is just one of a number of symptoms of unsustainable land management. The rural sustainability crisis manifests itself in many ways, including an escalating rate of loss of biodiversity, a loss of land available for agricultural production, a reactive increase to the use of chemicals and fertilisers, a loss of social and economic infrastructure, and a loss of community confidence in the efficacy of farming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Action to address salinity needs to be undertaken within the context of an overall understanding of the interrelated problems confronting our rural environment, economy and communities. If one is to believe all the pre&hyphen;state election rhetoric, WA is poised on the edge of an unprecedented, coordinated
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whole of government campaign to reverse the effects of decades of mismanagement of our rural lands and waterways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The salinity action plan campaign goes under the telling subtitle of `the war on salt'. This type of macho rhetoric is not far removed from the earlier rhetoric of `the battle against the bush', under which banner millions of hectares of native vegetation were removed from the agricultural region in the first place. It betrays a mind&hyphen;set that is not open, consultative, considered and seeking to make peace with the land we all call home. To a large extent the war on salt campaign is predicated on the allocation of substantial amounts of ongoing funding from the Commonwealth through the Natural Heritage Trust Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate has exposed many fundamental flaws in the setting up and operation of the Natural Heritage Trust and we appear to have equivalent flaws with the way the salinity action plan is being set up. We see a lack of transparency, a lack of openness and a lack of accountability. Most of all we begin to see deceit about action, money and intent with this state election promise. As with the trust, the salinity action plan has not been put out for public comment. It is a plan produced by a small number of senior bureaucrats and ministers, each with their own agendas. As with the trust, the salinity plan is controlled by a small group of ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Out of a claimed total annual investment of $100 million in the salinity action plan, the WA government is proposing to invest just $57 million, and much of this is to be reallocated from existing government programs. In 1997&hyphen;98 the state government is allocating only $5 million of new money to the plan. In other words, we have a deafening announcement of a $3 billion flagship salinity action  plan, and in its first year of operation the government allocates a mere $5 million of real new money. Is that some kind of joke?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state government is also asking for $30 million per year from the Natural Heritage Trust Fund. It is apparent that some, if not all, of the $30 million is being requested essentially to fund farm forestry programs.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5518"> While there are definite benefits in promoting farm forestry, and it needs to be implemented extensively, this funding does need careful scrutiny to ensure it meets the objectives of the trust. Also under the plan, the notorious WA Department of Conservation and Land Management, which I have previously described to you as Genghis CALM, is to reschedule its debt repayments in order to fund a largely experimental $18 million per year investment in commercial pine plantations in the drier areas of the agricultural region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We thus see government agencies, which are supposed to be concerned with nature conservation, becoming increasingly entrepreneurial and using their limited budgets in questionable ways. We are alarmed at the potential for fundamental requirements, such as ecological sustainability and the protection of biodiversity, being overlooked in favour of thinly veiled commercial crops and commercial enterprises. Money to set up commercial farm forestry enterprises, or to encourage other commercial crops, notwithstanding the positive environmental and economic benefits, should not be coming from what is effectively the nation's only real source of environment and nature conservation funding, limited as it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We thus see with the salinity action plan a further mirroring of the budgetary contortions of the Natural Heritage Trust Fund in that money from this plan will be transferred from, or be at the expense of, other important core environmental programs within the state government's or other governments' environmental programs. Under this deceitful process, overall environmental funding is actually being reduced and narrowed in its focus. Siphoning off relatively large sums of money from the whole environment budget and spending them not even on the overall integrated rural sustainability plan but on an even narrower salinity management plan is simply unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To summarise, the salinity action plan is shaping up as being seriously flawed in five key ways: firstly, its narrow focus on the symptoms&mdash;that is, salinity&mdash;instead of a broad approach based on rural ecologically
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sustainable development; secondly, a lack of community consultation; thirdly, dubious and difficult to follow funding arrangements; fourthly, it is being driven too strongly by a narrow short-term commercial agenda; and fifthly, the lack of attention to biodiversity conservation&mdash;for example, the plan does not involve an end to land clearing, which still continues to this very day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a sign of just how narrow and superficial this salinity action plan threatens to be, the state government has just axed a landmark committee and buried the report from that committee that makes recommendations for significant comprehensive reform of natural resources management in WA. That committee was the natural resources management task force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is most important to note that the way the government is proceeding at the moment risks repeating all of the mistakes of the past. For over 70 years, governments were warned about the serious adverse effects of massive land clearing in the south-west. For decades, scientists, conservationists, some agriculturalists and others were criticised or ignored by successive governments when calling for a slowing down or halting of the expansion of clear land farming into increasingly marginal lands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now with this new government initiative, the concerns and warnings from scientists, conservationists and the wider community are once again being ignored or marginalised. The government is not listening to calls for community consultation on the plan. The `we know best' attitude that has brought rural WA to its knees is still alive and well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats, state and federal, will be keeping a very close watch on the way this salinity action plan unfolds because we do not want to be party to a repetition of the mistakes of the past. We urge both govern ments, state and federal, to be as proactive as they can to make sure that the salinity action plan really does deliver its promise.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="4.37 p.m." PAGE="5518"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 4.37 p.m. until Monday, 25 August 1997 at 12.30 p.m.</EMPHASIS>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health and Family Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a)-(e) The Office of the Ombudsman, following complaints received, wrote to the Department of Health and Family Services in August 1996. There followed an exchange of correspondence between the Department of Health and Family Services and the Office of the Ombudsman. On 23 April 1997 two officers from the Department of Health and Family Services met with the Melbourne office of the Ombudsman. At that meeting, the Departmental officers assured the Ombudsman's office that they would have access whatever material was required to satisfy their inquiries pursuant to complaints received. At that meeting, the Departmental officers also made arrangements for the visit of an officer from the Ombudsman's office to the Department of Health and Family Services on 28-29 April 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ombudsman's office has not, as yet, provided a report to the Department of Health and Family Services, and the Minister cannot pre-empt any findings of the Ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a) The officer concerned was not expressing the views of the Minister. The officer was not authorised to make contact with the office of Senator Harradine. However, I am advised that the information provided to Senator Harradine's office was correct. The solicitors acting for APQ (the Victorian law firm Rennick Briggs) requested considerable material from the Commonwealth in the period leading up to the scheduled trial date (7 April 1997). All documents ultimately sought by APQ's solicitors were provided.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The Minister is aware of representations by Ms Weeks. On 22 May 1997 the Australian Government Solicitor's Office in Melbourne responded on behalf of the Minister. A copy of that response is attached.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 26 May 1997 in the Supreme Court of NSW, Macedone Christie Willis indicated to the Court that the parties had almost resolved the issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) It would be inappropriate to provide a copy of the legal advice, but it can be confirmed that the advice is that these types of actions are not recognised at law</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The incidence of CJD remains extremely rare As each year passes, more recipients are reaching the stage where the risk of contracting CJD is similar to that of the general population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">CJD is a rare disease occurring at the rate (for all types of CID) of one in a million in the general population per annum. The incubation period for iatrogenic CJD in Australia is in a range of 14 to 16&mdash;&cent; years. The Australian Human Pituitary hormone Program (AHPHP) ceased in 1985 AHPHP recipients confirmed with CID were treated early (1973-78) in the program. There has not been a death of an AHPHP recipient from CJD since 1991</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Advice has been received that the CJD registry in Melbourne is aware of small number of cases where blood or tissue donation occurred and the donors subsequently died of CJD). There is no record of organ donation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6)(a)-(c) Post-mortem confirmation is not essential for the Commonwealth's offer to operate.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> While definitive diagnosis of the presence of CreutzfeldtJakob disease is confirmed by autopsy there are nevertheless clear clinical symptoms of CJD, including dementia, sudden myoclonic muscular jerks and unusual brainwave patterns as indicated by electroencephalograph (EEG). Given the knowledge of a pituitary hormone recipient's personal and clinical history, it will be reasonable to assume that the confirmed presence of such symptoms&mdash;if they become evident&mdash;could be attributed to CJD, and compensation processes will then be able to commence on considered expert medical advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has already paid compensation to hormone recipients without autopsy. There are universally recognised signs of CJD which, on the balance of probabilities, can be attributable to CJD. The primary reason for the settlement proposal was to give `peace of mind' so that should someone contract CJD that person's dependants will also receive support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of the joint statement by Professors Mims and McCullagh on 22 April, this statement appears to be based upon a requirement that diagnosis and detection of a disease be "beyond reasonable doubt". This is not the test which the Commonwealth has used with respect to the Trust Account, the settlement of earlier claims following death or the settlement proposal currently being considered by recipients. As stated in the answer to question 6 (a) above, the Commonwealth uses the test that C]D is the most probable diagnosis rather than the more rigorous standard of "beyond reasonable doubt".</PARA>
