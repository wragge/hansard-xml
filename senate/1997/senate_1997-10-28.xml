<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to Senator Herron, the Minister representing the Minister for Family Services. Minister, did the Prime Minister state point&hyphen;blank on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>  this morning when discussing nursing homes: `I wouldn't expect it to be changed again, no, because the changes we have made represent the finetuning I promised before I left Australia.' Is it not a fact, however, that in parliament yesterday Minister Smith flagged his desire for further change and indicated in his press release that he may make further adjustments? Can you please clarify these mixed messages?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Neal for her question. I am happy to clarify those messages which Senator Neal considers mixed; they are not mixed at all. The Prime Minister made perfectly clear that the fundamentals would not change: the bonds will be paid; no-one will be forced to sell their home; that no-one now in a nursing home or hostel will be affected; that people who can afford it should contribute to the cost of their care&mdash;and Senator Neal should take particular note of that, because both of them have said that&mdash;that the taxpayer subsidises nursing homes and hostels by $2,600 million a year at present; and the only alternative to user pays is more tax at a time when the taxpayer base is shrinking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said repeatedly, with the ageing of the population, the taxpayer base is shrinking dramatically. They are the only alternatives. So there is no mixed message whatever. It is interesting that Senator Neal comes in with these questions trying to highlight certain things. For example, she asked yesterday&mdash;and I will be tabling the answer at the end of question time:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I raise a point of order. Do you believe it is in order for Senator Herron to so obviously stray from the question asked today by Senator Neal to a question that was asked yesterday by Senator Neal? It is proper for the minister&mdash;who yet again could not answer a question directed to him about nursing homes&mdash;to table the answer after question time, but I am sure you would agree with me that it is not in order for him to canvass that issue so directly in answer to this question today.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, on the point of order: the point that I was making is relevant to the question because it is the same analogy that Senator Neal made yesterday about which I am answering a question today. I think it is relevant because I was going to make the point in relation to that question. I will certainly table the answer at the end of question time, but it is relevant to the answer that I am giving now.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam President, but if a question was asked yesterday about what it would cost to pulp some sort of imaginary thing, the answer would be nil because it did not occur. The point I am making is that there is no disparity between the two statements. The basic principles stand: no person in a nursing home or a hostel will be affected; and bonds will stay in place. So there is no disparity between what the Prime Minister said and what the minister said yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I must say that I am at a loss to understand how the Prime Minister's saying that there will be no change and the minister's saying that there will be change is not contradictory. Obviously Senator Herron is not going to answer that question. Maybe he can answer this question: will you guarantee on this occasion, after these changes, that no Australian will have to sell

It is clearly not a supplementary and does not, in any shape or form, arise out of the subject matter of the first part of the question, which was a contrast between remarks made by Mr Smith and by the Prime Minister. Now we are being asked for a generalised guarantee on some other aspect of the issue.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important question. There is no doubt that our decision to reel in expenditure did cause and is still causing some electoral pain. Hard decisions by a government often do, but sometimes hard decisions are also absolutely necessary in the best interests of the total community. I can tell you, the decisions this coalition government took when it came to office to address the $10 billion deficit we inherited from Labor have turned out to be critically important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the difficult broader economic circumstances which have just been referred to, it is comforting to know that inflation in this country is now at a 35&hyphen;year low. As you know, the $10 billion deficit of Labor will be turned next year into a surplus&mdash;within three years the domestic deficit will be a domestic surplus. Last year we were able to repay debt, this year we have been able to repay debt and next year we will be able to repay debt, so that by the year 2000 the debt to GDP ratio will have halved to 10 per cent. Interest rates are now at their lowest in 20 years, housing is now 25 per cent more affordable than when Labor was in government, we have not had a speculative boom in relation to asset prices over recent times, problem loans in the banking system are historically low and business investment is at very high levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important that we have an economy in which the fundamentals are right.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a fact that 40 per cent of people in nursing homes do not pay anything. . . They do not pay because they are fully pensionable.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement was made at the time and, as Senator Forshaw well knows, it was made in relation to the bonds. It was fairly obvious at the time that that was the context. Senator Forshaw, the percentage varies, as you know, according to the number. For example, the number of people in hostels, as at the beginning of this month, was 63,145 and the number in nursing homes was 74,406. With the changes that were announced yesterday, none of those people will be affected by any changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the charges, they were the charges, as Senator Forshaw well knows, that were introduced by the Labor government, and all that we have done is continue that. The changes that were introduced were in relation to nursing homes and the up&hyphen;front bonds. They are similar in principle to what the Labor Party introduced into hostels, and they are similar in principle to when people go into retirement villages, hostels or nursing homes. The principle is the same. So to allege that I have misled the Senate is totally incorrect. But I am not surprised at this sort of statement because the whole of the strategy of the opposition is to mislead, misinform, create smokescreens and make false statements which are entirely designed to upset older people in nursing homes and the proprietors of nursing homes&mdash;the people who are affected predominantly. That was the point I was making of the self&hyphen;funded retirees and people who contribute to upkeep in nursing homes. It is significant that that group said they were happy with the changes that the government was introducing.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Currently the MUA, through the seamen's engagement system, supplies all the ratings for the supply vessels offshore and it is important that senators understand just how this system works. Firstly, a company is prevented from engaging a seafarer for use throughout its fleet. Commonly seafarers are allocated from ports, like Newcastle, to work on the North West Shelf, often for very short periods, and they are flown to work at company expense on full pay, including, of course, a stopover in Perth. The seafarers receive more than a day's holiday for each day they work, resulting in 28 weeks paid leave a year. For each day worked, they get 1.53 days off.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you are interested in the health of these people and their safety, just listen to this: there is no adequate medical testing, which results in a compensation cost of 13 per cent of gross weekly earnings. Seafarers also get $50 a day just for being on the roster&mdash;not for working, just for being on the roster. Long&hyphen;service leave, clothing and other allowances are all centrally funded. The result is that in Australia's ships 66 per cent of operating costs are wage related. The international standard is 22 per cent, Senator O'Chee. Union rorting on this scale is bad enough but when it puts at risk the safety of crew members and people who work on the rigs it is totally intolerable.</PARA></TALK.START>

But I think that is right, from the map I originally saw. It went to the Queensland government for planning approval, and that was given.

The full 13 weeks will be served only if available funds are greater than $9,000 for a single person or $18,000 for other people. But not all redundancy payments are counted, Senator Denman.

I am required to determine whether a motion to refer a matter to the Privileges Committee should have precedence having regard to the following criteria:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">(a) the principle that the Senate's power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions, and should not be used in respect of matters which appear to be of a trivial nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">(b) the existence of any remedy other than that power for any act which may be held to be a contempt.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A matter is given precedence if it is capable of meeting criterion (a) and there is no other readily available remedy. Unauthorised disclosure of committee documents is declared by standing order 37 and resolution 6 of the Senate's privilege resolutions to be a matter which may constitute a contempt of the Senate. Allegations of unauthorised disclosure of reports of committees have been regarded as serious matters meeting criterion (a) and instances have been investigated by the Privileges Committee in the past. Signatories of a minority report are not authorised to disclose it before its presentation; minority reports are not in any different category from other committee documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I recently reminded the Senate, on 20 June 1996 the Senate adopted a recommendation of the Privileges Committee that, in cases of unauthorised disclosure of committee documents, the committee concerned should in the first instance inquire into the disclosure and determine whether it had a tendency substantially to interfere with the work of the com

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> indicates that when in opposition the minister knew exactly what he wanted to do. The policy was laid out. It was just a matter of telling the bureaucracy `implement'. Now we are 19 months on from the election and what do we find? In a press report of 17 October, which the minister has not denied, he has told a group of media company representatives that all of those issues I just listed have been put on the backburner until some time next year. There is no reason given why they have been put on the backburner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of speculation in the industry as to why the minister has gone weak&hyphen;kneed about these important issues. Some people are speculating that he has just got bored, tired or uninterested in these issues. Others have speculated that some of these important issues may directly or indirectly influence the float of Telstra and that he cannot say anything on them for that reason; that, as Telstra is a major shareholder of Foxtel, one of the pay TV operators having all that influence on siphoning rules, et cetera, he cannot say anything. This shows the absurdity of this policy of privatisation&mdash;that for a long period this minister cannot say anything because it may affect the prospectus that he has issued.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From both of you. The number of broken promises in the communications area by the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) is indeed legend. I was particularly angry at question time today to hear the appalling answer, on one of Senator Alston's broken promises, by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, in his response to a question on Radio Australia from Senator Bourne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the time of our government we substantially  upgraded the transmission facilities of Radio Australia. In fact, we installed brand new transmitters at Cox Peninsula. I might add that that was hardly an unusual move&mdash;BBC World Service has recently done precisely the same thing. The reason I mention that is that it was difficult to face the absolutely unequivocal breach of a very solemn pre&hyphen;election promise by Senator Alston. He promised:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition is strongly supportive of Radio Australia's existing services and will ensure they are not prejudiced or downgraded in any way.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Not only did he flagrantly breach that; he did so&mdash;and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  from question time in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> here will show it&mdash;on the spurious ground that short wave was an `obsolete technology', to quote Senator Alston, and therefore the decision was justified. I make the obvious point: this was very rapid obsolescence indeed for short wave. It was a perfectly valid technology just prior to the election and apparently its relevance to broadcasting collapsed in 24 hours after polling day here in Australia and it became an obsolete technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that that explanation by the minister was utterly untrue; it was false and the minister knew it. As I said a few moments ago, the BBC World Service has only in recent times, at very substantial cost, upgraded its short wave services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was recently talking to another major broadcaster about world services in respect of short wave. I was pleased to have this conversation with him because this executive is currently considering relocating some of the major short wave services that his company engages in here in Australia. He told me in no uncertain terms that, in respect of getting a message effectively into countries that do not enjoy the same level of freedom that we do here in this country, short wave is still the most effective means of broadcasting available. This company, should it relocate to Australia and, indeed, northern Australia&mdash;and I hope they do&mdash;will be investing a very significant amount in Australia in order to establish new short wave services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Have a look at the other promises Senator Alston made. No&hyphen;one will ever forget his polling night appearance in the national tally room, committing the government to maintaining the funding for the ABC for the `whole term of this government'. He then attempted to squib out of it by saying he had only been talking about the triennial funding for the ABC when, on national television, he clearly was not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not forget the solemn promise made by Senator Alston prior to the election to encourage and support the ongoing expansion of ABC Radio, including the extension of the highly successful Triple J network into regional Australia. In the Northern Territory it meant that, for the two regional communities for which Triple J had been scheduled to be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8212"> installed, that had to be frozen. It has been frozen since the election and is yet to be unfrozen. The impact on Triple J of the election of this government was to constrain the expansion of Triple J into regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other promise flagrantly breached by this minister was that the government announced an additional three&hyphen;year funding package for ATV and the coalition would maintain this commitment. Of course, since the election that commitment has also been entirely breached. In terms of broken promises, this government's front bench has no parallel, no equal to Senator Alston. He has a very impressive list indeed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), to  questions without notice asked by Senators Neal and Forshaw today, relating to nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have watched a campaign over the last couple of weeks to deliberately upset the most vulnerable members of our community, the frail aged, and to use them as a cheap political tool in a point scoring exercise by those in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us get some facts on the record in relation to this issue. Australia's aged care sector of the community is in a state of crisis because of 13 years of government neglect, which makes Labor's scare campaign all the more ludicrous and all the more disgraceful. Labor pursued a policy of running down nursing homes, doing nothing about the problem. They left our aged care facilities in a complete mess. Under the Hawke and Keating governments there was a 75 per cent reduction in funding for capital expenditure&mdash;a key reason why our nursing homes are now generally in a very poor state. Let us not forget that Mr Beazley, as finance minister, oversaw this very spectacular Labor achievement. Let us get it on the record: it is Labor's fault that nursing homes are in crisis.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our aging population and increasing health care costs mean that the Australian government must take action to provide a much higher standard and a more acceptable level of accommodation and care for elderly Australians. Labor failed in this area. They shamefully ignored the issue of care for our aged and now they are trying to shift attention away from the mess and onto us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us get some facts and some reality on the record. Income tested fees will begin on 1 March next year, but only for new residents. Residents who are in a nursing home or hostel now, or who enter care before 1 March, will not pay income tested fees. This protection will continue, even if they move to a different facility. If residents have paid higher fees in advance, any overpayment will be refunded. When income testing commences on 1 March for new residents only, their fees will not be affected by assets which they gave away before the aged care reforms were announced on 20 August. This will ensure that people who gifted assets before the reforms were announced will not face difficulties in paying their fees. Of course, hardship provisions will continue to be available for other residents who have genuine difficulty paying their fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Current hostel residents will now be protected from the increase in the hostel basic fee to bring it into line with the higher nursing home fees. This change, which took effect on 1 October, will now only affect residents entering hostels after that date. Current hostel residents who are paying the basic daily fee will have the same income left that they had on 30 September, as will hostel residents who are paying the higher variable fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Protection for the family home will be improved for accommodation bonds. The home itself will now be protected if a carer who is eligible for a pension or a benefit has lived there for the last two years, rather than for five years, as was previously the case. The family home will also continue to be automatically protected if a partner or dependent child lives there. For other family members, the five&hyphen;year provision will continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reforms have always provided for residents who can pay a bond a number of alternatives to selling their homes&mdash;something 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8213"> that was well known by those opposite but was not used in its dirty political scare campaign. Residents can pay periodically or they can agree to take their accommodation contribution from their estate if they wish. The government has said it will listen to older people's concerns, and it has done so. The evidence is in the announcements made yesterday by the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) in the other place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This package of changes will ease the transition to the new arrangements and provide additional protections for nursing home and hostel residents. We will continue to listen to suggestions for further options to allow more flexibility while maintaining the integrity of this policy. Unlike those opposite, we will not continue to ignore this sector of the community that was so disgracefully overlooked for 13 years by the Labor government.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps Senator Ferris could communicate her sentiments to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, an extremely conservative colleague of hers. Perhaps she could also communicate her assertion that the Northern Territory's conservative chief minister is engaged in `a dirty political scare campaign' to the Northern Territory's conservative minister for health, Mr Burke, who indeed had some very hard things to say about these changes that the government has made, including the statement just a few days ago that there are no winners from these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If anyone who is engaged in protesting and criticising these changes is engaged in `a dirty 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> political scare campaign', the cabinet and the leadership of the conservative government of the Northern Territory are included in it. The chief minister is quoted in the Northern Territory's media today as saying that he will be putting these issues on the table at a state and territory leaders meeting that is to occur shortly. We will see whether he gets any support for his `dirty political scare campaign' on the question of nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The so-called concessions that have been made are no concessions at all, except that they defer the inevitable for a period of some months. There is a significant and obvious downside to that so-called concession which I thought would have been obvious to anyone who has had anything to do with the frail aged and pensioners&mdash;indeed, I think most members of parliament do. They comprise a very significant part of my constituency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a set of pensioners flats directly across the road from my house and on occasion I am called across the road to give assurances to people who are worried and concerned when they get pieces of correspondence that simply have an official&hyphen;looking letterhead on them. That is particularly the case with frail aged who do not speak English as a first language. They get very upset if they come to the attention of anybody even slightly official. In the past I have had to provide reassurance to pensioners who do not speak English as a first language simply because they had received a form letter that is set out on letterhead and sent by all members of parliament offering them help or assistance if they require it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big downside to the so-called concessions is that the government is going to cause a great deal more stress to a lot of frail aged and their families because there will be a panic to get into nursing homes before March next year. I knew for certain yesterday that this will happen with some people. I know that the frail aged who are contemplating going into a nursing home will be on the telephone to their sons, daughters, nephews, or whatever family are looking after them, panic stricken saying, `You'd better make it quick.' With every day that passes and they cannot get into a nursing home before March, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8214"> the stress and pressure&mdash;as you know&mdash;is going to be even greater. I thought that that problem&mdash;it is a real problem&mdash;would be weighed, to some extent, by the benefit of the changes being made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Representatives of the industry whom I saw this morning were saying that. But it now appears to have been ruled out by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I saw him on television this morning making it absolutely clear that there will be no fundamental changes, that the changes that have occurred to this point in time are effectively going to be it. Frankly, I think that the only thing the government has accomplished by this so-called concession is creating even further stress to the aged community in Australia, if there are not going to be any further changes, by causing a panic among some sections of that community who are attempting to get into a nursing home before March next year.</PARA>

I understand that Senator Campbell would be extremely sensitive about the gold tax issue, as was shown when that question was asked in the parliament today, when he reacted very vigorously.

These things happen to all of us from time to time, so one should not make too great a point about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I want to remind Senator Campbell that the issue is nursing homes. One could say that, with the way the Liberal Party is treating the gold mining industry, most of the prospectors and miners will end up in nursing homes anyway because Liberal Party policies will put this industry out of action in Western Australia. We have no defence from Senator Campbell or the government over their unilateral decision to start selling Australia's gold reserves to affect the price.

It was such a convoluted and confused policy that it took a long time to sink in for our aged people in Australia. When it started to be implemented from 1 October, all hell broke loose. People realised that this policy was being written by Doug Moran, from his big nursing home network worth over $250 million, to advantage himself. He convinced the Liberal Party to adopt it, and that is why there is such outrage in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government cannot sort out sectional interest from public interest. They believe Doug Moran represents all the people in the nursing homes. Therefore, they are willing to adopt his policy, as they have. Now they have had to make a partial retreat. Yesterday, the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) had to back down and announce some changes, but the fundamental change has not been made: that is, people going into nursing homes next year will have to pay a significant bond. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.

The Minister must determine what is an acceptable risk because it is the Minister that is accountable to the people through the parliament not departmental officials and other bureaucrats.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consequences of a bad decision for our chicken, salmon and certain horticultural industries could be their total devastation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The poultry industry is a $2 billion industry which employs tens of thousands of Australians directly and many more indirectly. It is a 100 per cent Australian-owned industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the Central Coast, where I live, there is a large chicken industry involving 90 families and 1000 jobs. Newcastle Disease, the scourge of the poultry industry overseas, will wipe out this industry if it is accidentally introduced with chicken meat imports. It will not only wipe out the chicken industry on the Central Coast but it will wipe out our native bird population. Despite this, the Federal Government supports the applications from Thailand, Denmark and the United State to import cooked chicken into this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I notice that Members who have large chicken industries in their electorate such as the Member for Patterson and the Member for Robertson did not support this bill when it was presented in the House of Representatives by my colleague, the Member for the Hunter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope that they have a good explanation for the 90 families and 1,000 people employed on the Central Coast, the 3,000 people in the Hunter region who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8221"> are directly employed by the chicken processing and growing industries; for the many more people in the Hunter who are indirectly employed; for the more than 45,000 people Australia-wide who are employed either directly or indirectly by this industry; and, for the tens of thousands who are employed directly or indirectly by other industries such as the apple and pear industries and the salmon industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The all-party Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport unanimously supported the proposition that the final decision on these matters should rest squarely with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current Minister for Primary Industries and Energy was appalled by the prospect that we might allow the importation of cooked chicken meat from countries such as Thailand, Denmark and the United States when he was a Shadow Minister in the then Opposition, and he told the industry so. In a letter to an industry representative dated 14 February 1996, he said this:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you know, the federal coalition has for some time expressed concerns about the adequacy of Australia's quarantine arrangements and, in particular, the import risk assessment process used by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our concerns have been confirmed by leading members of the scientific community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many scientific experts have said time and time again that allowing chickens to be imported into Australia involves enormous risk. We have now seen that Newcastle disease survives in Antarctic conditions, yet the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS) want us to accept their proposition that somehow half cooking chicken meat can eradicate Newcastle disease.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AQIS were frustrated under the former Minister, Senator Bob Collins. They failed to gain his approval for the import of these products, so as soon as they had a new Minister in John Anderson they appealed again and this time they managed to get the Minister's support to allow cooked chicken meat to be imported. The Minister then claimed when confronted that he didn't have the power to change the decision even if he wanted to. This bill will give him the power and stop him from buck passing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the sake of the Australian poultry industry and the vital industry in regions such as the Central Coast, I ask Senators to support this bill. The risk from imported disease to Australia's chicken industry and native bird population is unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What this bill does is put the power for decision on issues relating to quarantine in the hands of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Minister and ensures that the parliament is able to scrutinise his decision on behalf of the Australia people rather than leaving it in the hand of unaccountable bureaucrats.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope all Senators, particularly those that care about the viability of the chicken industry in Australia and our native wildlife threatened by imported diseases will support this bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make just a few brief comments in relation to the legislation which is the subject of the committee's report. When this inquiry began, a very, very wide gulf existed in terms of wheat marketing&mdash;particularly with the export market&mdash;between the eastern and western sides of the country. The point I would make here is that, during the process of the bringing together of the committee's report, most issues have been resolved and are no longer outstanding. However, there are a couple of issues that I would like to touch on briefly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first issue relates to the situation that exists with taxation, where there is an outstanding issue as far as the industry and some of the people in it are concerned. At this point I should also mention the fact that, being a partner in a wheat growing operation, I have an interest in the industry and in the outstanding issues of how taxation is to be treated, particularly relating to capital gains tax, with the conversion of funds from WIF into shares, as the matter progresses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue raised was that of the first and second tranches of the legislation. In this report the preferred position of the opposition was to delay this legislation and get the whole matter dealt with in one piece of legislation. There is a point that I want to make relating to that&mdash;and it is certainly not the position of the committee nor the government: this legislation, as is pointed out in the report, can stand alone in its own right. Nonetheless, I believe that over the early part of next year we will see the second tranche of the legislation come before us. It will finalise the position where growers in the industry, through the corporatised Australian Wheat Board with its separate structures of A and B class shares, will take control of and own the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These issues were technically outside the committee's terms of reference. Nonetheless, the industry representatives&mdash;whether from the Grains Council or the various states, New South Wales and Western Australia in particular&mdash;did raise all the various issues and matters.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8230">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will have more to say on these matters as and when the bill comes before the Senate. However, I would make the point that it is very important, we believe, to allow this legislation to go forward at this time, so that the Wheat Board can set up its new modernised structures, get its lines of credit in place and do the necessary things to move the marketing of wheat into the next century. After 1999, the privatisation of the wheat industry will come to fruition, and this piece of legislation is an interim step along that road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I commend this report to the Senate. This piece of legislation, being enabling legislation, will allow that progression to the modernisation of the wheat industry. Funds will have been compulsorily acquired from growers for 10 years at a rate of two per cent per annum. At the end of that time, the growers, through the issuing of a prospectus in due course, will be able to get access to their funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some instances, particularly once again in the state I come from, Western Australia, there are some very large contributions to that particular fund running out to $250,000. So it becomes very important to growers to be able to access that capital base, as well as through the A and B class share arrangements and the corporate structure that has been put in place, and to be able to keep control of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a lot more relevant detail and, as I said, we will go into it in the debate on the bill. But I make these points at this time. I commend this legislation to the Senate, and I wish it a speedy passage through this place.</PARA></SPEECH>

Also, I commend the committee secretariat for their assistance in the drafting of the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our position, which is in opposition to some of the matters to which Senator Crane has referred, is contained in the report proper, and no dissenting or minority report has been published. I would draw the attention of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senate to those parts of the report which set out our dissent in relation to the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be said that we support the general principle of the legislative scheme proposed, at least in part, by this bill&mdash;and that is, we support an overall package of measures to achieve the stated end aim. However, we do not agree that it is appropriate to process this scheme through a two-stage legislative arrangement. We are dealing with one tranche of the legislation now. We will see the second tranche of legislation some time in the New Year perhaps, dependent upon the processes of government. Those two tranches together form the legislative scheme that we give our support to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It can only be in the government's mind at this stage what exactly will be in the second tranche of legislation. We believe that if as legislators we are to support a package, we should have that package before us. We enumerate some of those concerns in the report summary at the bottom of page 2, going to page 3. We say there:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While there has been essentially bi&hyphen;partisan support for the legislation scheme proposed by the Bill, differences between the members of the Committee have arisen over the timing of its consideration by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was concern expressed by a number of industry representatives that they were being asked to endorse the whole wheat legislation package without having the opportunity to scrutinise all the detail of that package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry is also concerned that it is being asked to endorse the new structure for the AWB without knowing the details of the new taxation regime to apply.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You will see in the report that there is quite a deal of material about concerns particularly about taxation arrangements that apply to the wheat industry fund moneys as they are converted to category B shares under the proposed incorporated arrangements of the new Australian Wheat Board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the formal opposition recommendation, I suppose it can be encapsulated in the statement which appears, I think, on page 3 of the printed report. I do not have a copy before me, but that is my understanding of where it appears. It says:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8231">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition Members of the Committee recommend that consideration of the Bill be deferred until the industry, and this Committee, examine the details of the whole package of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, the Committee, and the industry, should properly consider the new taxation regime to apply to the restructured AWB and growers before any further changes are legislated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence from the wheat industry to the Committee strongly supports this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Chair of the Committee, Senator Crane, correctly stated that in the commercial world `. . . it is against the law to put up half a prospectus; you have to put up one that is signed off with the Australian Stock Exchange.'. This Committee . . . should require that the same rule applies to legislation coming before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, the AWB told the Committee to progress the legislation in two parts was highly desirable but not critical. The AWB, while accepting the Government's desire to progress the legislation in two parts, said it would have preferred to deal with only one package.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the essence of our recommendation and the basis for the opposition's approach. Indeed, if all we are doing with this legislation is to effectively give a new face to the Australian Wheat Board and make no change of substance to its operation, which I think is the logical conclusion to which you would take the evidence presented to the committee by the department, then there is indeed no urgency to pass this legislation, other than the pressure from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We take the view that, as legislators, indeed in the interest of the industry, it would be better if the package of measures were dealt with together so that the outcome arrived at in the Senate would not be one which assumes things or is governed by a decision previously taken, which is a possibility arising out of a two&hyphen;stage approach. Given also that we are advised informally, at least, that the government would expect to have this legislation before the parliament in March next year, we are not talking about an inordinate delay or in any significant way disadvantaging the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the position which has been put to the opposition in relation to this legislation, to put it simply, is that, if the tax issue to which both I and Senator Crane referred is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not resolved to the satisfaction of the industry, certainly a number of people in the industry would prefer that none of this legislation goes ahead. We do not have an answer on that. The industry has been waiting a considerable amount of time for an answer in relation to the tax status of those wheat industry fund moneys when converted to class B shares. If we cannot have that answer, then I think this Senate is entitled to know why not. Indeed, the industry or certain significant sectors of the industry have said that they would rather this matter not proceed until we have an answer. So, in short, that is the basis of the opposition's position in this matter. When the legislation comes before the Senate, we will be seeking its deferral and we will be seeking to move a second reading amendment to that effect.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to delay the Senate, but there are a couple of things I need to signal. The Australian Democrats were totally in agreement with the report presented which contained a very good overview of this whole issue. I need to signal, as perhaps Senator O'Brien has done, that, while the peak bodies and particularly the Grains Council and many other people have indicated their support for the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill, the more people I talk to the more I realise that that support is qualified. Many people who have given qualified support to this bill believe or feel that they do not have any other options.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I get very worried about the feeling I get that peak bodies and often growers feel constrained by the fact that they get the impression from government that this is the only option they have, so they better support it or else. It is very hard to test that. Certainly individual farmers are saying that. But, again in talking to the Grains Council, they wish this legislation to be passed and it seems that many of the issues which were in dispute have been resolved. But I did just want to signal that I am still getting mixed signals on this one. There may be some amendments that the Democrats will wish to move in relation to this legislation. I will certainly give notice of those in plenty of time if we do proceed to do that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8232">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I just have to raise this concern that I have that peak bodies sometimes do feel pressured by government. I do not think that necessarily applies to one side of politics or the other; I think it is just part of the problem we have in Western democracies of trying to take account of everybody's concerns, the time it takes to do that and the problem we have in these consultation processes when you have people who disagree. It is very easy for them to say, `I haven't been consulted.' But, on the other hand, I do not think we are very good at finding a consultation process that really enables people to feel they have been heard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am signalling just those issues. I will not take up any more time of the Senate. There will be an opportunity to debate the bill when it comes before us. I hear what the Labor Party are saying about the possibility of a delay. I will need to look at that before I can respond absolutely one way or the other. I just thought it was important that I put some of those concerns on the record while saying that I certainly support the report, which is all we have before us at this time.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="r341">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  is the first step towards restoring certainty for all Australians involved in native title claims. The committee's report concluded that it is a fair and sensible response to the problems 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which have become evident both in the operation of the act and in response to the High Court's Wik decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee received a wide range of evidence from a large number of groups and individuals in the pastoral and resources industries, Aboriginal and indigenous communities and wider community groups which clearly demonstrated the unworkability of the existing Native Title Act. In fact, it was described by the Australian Mining and Exploration Council as both `ineffective and unworkable'. In particular, AMEC described the current right to negotiate regime as an effective statutory infrastructure cost which mining companies now need to build in as an additional cost for virtually any new project they are interested in developing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other evidence was given of the investment which is being driven overseas because of native title concerns. Ms Catherine Hobbs, a geologist and consultant to a medium sized mining and exploration company, told the committee of her extensive experience in Western Australia and in South Australia, particularly with the right to negotiate process prescribed by the Native Title Act. Her experiences were particularly valuable as they were derived from people working at the coalface of native title negotiations with indigenous groups as well as herself having worked in the mining industry for more than 25 years. She told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We now have a situation where it is common for competing overlapping claims to be lodged by sisters and brothers, and even for the same people&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, we can have two or more native title claims over the same area, by the same signatories&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some native title claimants also express anger and frustration that they cannot access the benefits they seek from the mining industry, because of unachievable, high demands made by competing claimants which they consider to be without any foundation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is very clear evidence for the need for amendment. That is the all too often tragic refrain that we heard when we visited remote communities, Alice Springs, Cairns and Broome. Native title disputes have the capacity to divide communities, to set Aboriginal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8233"> group against Aboriginal group, family against family, brother against sister&mdash;to say nothing of the divisive situation in many remote regional towns in this country where Aborigines were previously an accepted part of the wider community and indeed were respected members of the community. When genuine efforts of mining companies to reach agreements with indigenous people are frustrated by tribal jealousies and rivalries, not only do the mining companies lose out but it clearly works against the financial benefit of the indigenous parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very disturbing to see the evidence of the overlapping claims in this country. In this place just last week I spoke of the very sad experiences of a remote pastoral family who tried very hard three years ago to establish an agreement for access that a claimant group wanted to their property but have been frustrated to the extent that they now find themselves in the Federal Court and with the likely cost of millions of dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the tragedy of the Native Title Act as it stands now. It serves to create anger, frustration and division on all sides and patently does nothing for reconciliation. The  Native Title Amendment Bill  tries to address some of these concerns in a balanced, fair and I believe sensible way. I commend the committee's report to the Senate for its consideration.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Joint Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund Committee had an important responsibility. It was addressing an important national issue and it had a critical assessment to make in a short period. In short, the committee owed it to both the parliament and the Australian people to conduct a thorough, incisive and fair inquiry. This committee had a responsibility to listen to stakeholders for it gave the stakeholders a last and, in some cases, desperate chance to be heard. Through this committee the parliament had a last opportunity to make a dispassionate, objective assessment of the government's 10-point plan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of this committee, in essence, was to do what the government had failed to do. It had failed to listen to open and wide 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> criticism of the bill, it had failed to identify problems and it had failed to listen to a widespread range of witnesses and to assess their claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite 20 days of hearings, 2,000 pages of transcript and some 5,000 pages of evidence, I think the committee failed in its responsibility. For this reason, we have two separate reports&mdash;a majority and minority report&mdash;and two separate models.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the problems were not of the committee's making. It was a rushed process. It was a very big bill and it had a large schedule as well. Submissions were handed to the committee members at the same time as witnesses were to be examined. In fact, the federal government submission was handed over as we were about to examine the government witnesses over the content of the submission. It was a rushed process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite some of the problems not being of the committee's own making, in my 16 years as a member of this place, this has to be the worst process that I have had to suffer. Witnesses were harangued and the chairman showed unprofessional conduct in terms of his responsibilities. He carried with him a perception of a conflict of interest. But the way the witnesses were badgered does no credit to this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately, the majority report and its barren four minor recommendations are witness to the fact that government members were not listening. In fact, in the face of overwhelming evidence of disquiet on all sides as to fairness and workability of the bill, the government majority has chosen to toe the government line. We had, for instance, the unseemly experience of the chairman going on the public record as being in favour of the Australian Law Reform Commission appearing before the committee only to reverse his attitude following the government expressing its opposition to the move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we saw in the media yesterday, the committee did not hear the views of all stakeholders. As reported, the indigenous people in the Kimberley region were not heard. It is no wonder that Peter Yu, the executive director of the Kimberley Land 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8234"> Council, had this to say over the last 24 hours or so:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of these concerns only reinforce our sense that the committee's inquiry was not a genuine inquiry into the issues. We fear it was a perfunctory exercise whose conclusion was known by us all from the outset.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a disturbing lingering opinion to have after a process such as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to these people, as the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs said yesterday, the process did not provide them with an opportunity for reconciliation; it was a humiliation. It was incumbent on the minority members of the committee to say a few things that the coalition members dared not say. That is why we have produced a report of some 160 pages, twice as long as the majority report. We have reflected on the overwhelming evidence presented, saying that the legislation is unworkable, it is unduly complex, it will visit unprecedented bills for compensation from the Australian taxpayers and it is doomed for multiple challenges in the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Expert witnesses by the score came forward to demonstrate that this legislation in its present form is unworkable and a recipe for uncertainty and economic stagnation for regional Australia. The committee could refuse to hear the Australian Law Reform Commission, but they could not silence them, nor could they avoid the evidence of the Victorian Law Institute and the New South Wales Bar Association. Those bodies are now all on record with their trenchant and detailed criticism of the bill. With respect to the institute, the bar association and the commission, their views cannot be dismissed as vested interests easily consigned to the `you would expect them to say that' category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last few hours we have had another attempt by the government to intimidate those who have an interest in getting a fair, full and proper briefing on this legislation. We have had an act of desperation by a government losing the debate trying to raise a matter of privilege with respect to the opposition yesterday briefing journalists as to our directions for native title. It is very much a trumped up charge. I would maintain very strongly that, despite the allegations on behalf 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the government, Senator Abetz and Senator Ferris, I do not think there is any case to show that we have breached the Parliamentary Privileges Act. If you look at the act, there is an essential aspect of what constitutes parliamentary privilege.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the stakeholders&mdash;the miners, the petroleum industry, the pastoralists, government, pearling and fishing interests, indigenous people and the Australian taxpayer&mdash;have every right to expect that those gathered in this place would work for their benefit. We have sought to present an alternative which is based on two principles&mdash;certainty and, with certainty, justice. We maintain that you cannot have a certain outcome with respect to the post-Wik legislation without justice for all 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8235"> and justice, in this case, for indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone has a right to expect that we will approach legislation such as the Native Title Amendment Bill with the objective of achieving certainty and justice in the outcome. To that extent, we think that the balance that we have provided does protect the rights of pastoralists and miners and provides recommendations as to tax assistance for the mining industry when they were involved in agreements and compensation for native title claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We made recommendations relating to the raising of the threshold test, the protection of indigenous rights and the rejection of what is very much extensive extinguishment by this government, which takes place through a number of avenues&mdash;for instance, extinguishment through a shredding of the right to negotiate, extinguishment through direct legislative extinguishment, extinguishment through confirmation of extinguishment and extinguishment through raising the bar to unacceptable levels and the bar of access to the claims tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these different aspects are unfair to not only indigenous Australia but also the Australian taxpayer and that is something that this government has to take into account. You can do what you need to do to protect the pastoralists and the industry and at the same time protect the rights of indigenous Australians and overall you can protect the interests of the Australian taxpayer. The Australian taxpayer should not have to foot the bill for indulgence in gratuitous extinguishment that the government's 10&hyphen;point plan is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the government: we presented a model and we think that is a model that is workable and would provide the certainty that the government's legislation does not provide. There is nothing sacrosanct about the 10&hyphen;point plan. The 10&hyphen;point plan should be seen as a model that can be developed, worked upon and improved in the same way as we would argue that our alternative also has a capacity to be developed, refined and improved. But if one side of this place is going to take the attitude that, `This is what we have done; it is etched in stone like the Ten Command 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ments and we are not going to move away from our 10&hyphen;point plan,' that does absolutely nothing for a constructive outcome for our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to address this issue as a national parliament with our national interests at heart. We do not need to address this issue motivated by a sectional interest or dictated to by a parliamentary party and, with respect to the coalition, by one rump of that parliamentary party. We do not need to be pushed into an outcome here which is based on the fear of what the Hanson vote might do to one part of the coalition. We need a constructive, flexible discussion as we go ahead over the next few weeks or so to decide on the government's 10&hyphen;point plan and we need to keep in mind a national interest. But we also need to keep in mind that to achieve that national interest of certainty we need to give justice to indigenous Australians. This legislation as it is currently framed is discriminatory. It is unfair and unless we can rectify that and give people a real role in the negotiations we will finish up in the Federal Court within two weeks of its passing and in the High Court for 10 years after it is passed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title and the Torres Strait Islander Land Fund.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I need to say that the Australian Democrats sympathise with the concerns of both Aborigines and pastoralists in the wake of the Mabo and Wik decisions and the changes to common understandings of land title that those decisions have brought. However, I want to say that the dispossession of Aboriginal people who have suffered in this country is an historical fact which cannot be denied. The forced removal of Aboriginal people from their traditional lands, the introduction of diseases and the policies of assimilation which sought to eradicate Aboriginal culture and tradition have left this country with an unresolved problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority of Aboriginal people in Australia are financially, socially and emotionally at a massive disadvantage compared with the descendants of immigrants to Australia. While the Democrats realise the deva 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8236"> stating extent of rural poverty which many pastoral lease&hyphen;holders are now suffering, we believe that Aboriginal poverty cannot be discounted. There are a lot of things I could say about the report. I think they will be covered in debate, in the media and in this place, but I thought I might have a way of helping the Senate understand that there are ways beyond this legislation no matter what we pass in the end and that in fact this legislation will not solve our problems. Whether it is the amendments of the 10&hyphen;point plan or whether it is amendments proposed by the Democrats and Labor and others which amend the bill&mdash;even if they are passed, whatever shape that bill might take in the end, that is not going to solve the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concerns that the Democrats have are for this country, the future of Aboriginal people, the future of pastoralists and the future of mining. Our concern is that in the end the only way of resolving these issues will be face&hyphen;to&hyphen;face negotiation. Neither this legislation nor decisions of any court are going to solve this situation. I thought I would place on the record the experience of one land&hyphen;holder in Queensland who faced up to a native title claim on their property. It might be useful for us to hear the words these people would leave with us, as a suggestion for a way through. The piece is written by Camilla Cowley, the wife of the couple concerned in this article. It comes from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Catholic Leader</EMPHASIS> of 7 September 1997 and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many families in rural Australia are having difficulty dealing with the repercussions for them of the Wik decision, which has created the possibility of native title co&hyphen;existing with the title they have to their family properties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How we as Catholics deal with this was the problem I faced when our property was placed under a native title claim last year by the Gunggari people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initial fear that we were to be dispossessed of our home, my children's heritage, was not addressed by the advice we received from our producer organisations or by the extreme reactions of some government spokespeople.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">She then goes on to describe the process in which the local church, other pastoralists, she and a number of different Aboriginal groups&mdash;because they ended up with more than one claim over their property&mdash;were able to meet together and to resolve those differences together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot read the whole article because it is too long but this is the challenge that she concludes her article with, and it is one that we need to hear:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we all need to face as Australians, no matter what our place or station in life, is that we owe that place to the dispossession of our indigenous people. I feel at least some of the tension in the grazing community results from their seeing themselves as being singled out as the main instigators and perpetrators of that original injustice.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That feeling is very strong amongst pastoralists&mdash;as though they have to carry the whole blame. The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus the desire for reconciliation in our area is hampered by the perception in many areas that reconciliation is in the main the burden of the pastoralists. For real reconciliation to become the ethos of our nation every Australian must accept that we all owe our place here to that original dispossession.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At least some of the fire could be removed from the debate if this fact were addressed honestly by each one of us, city dweller, freehold farmer or pastoralist. The freedom this understanding has given me has been the impetus behind my loss of fear for what the future may hold for families such as my own. It has given me courage to enter the debate on the side of the very people who have claimed my family farm. Whatever courts may decide in the future, I have been blessed by meeting with many wonderful people who have taught me that trust is the first step in personal reconciliation, and that we could, if we opened our hearts, take the necessary steps towards helping to build an Australia our children will be proud to share&mdash;not only with our indigenous people, but with all peoples who call this land their own.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing some brief remarks to this report by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="r358">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , let me commence by complimenting the work of Mr Peter Grundy and the secretariat of the committee. Once again they have done a tremendous amount of work in coordinating the committee's hearings, organising witnesses and other matters. I want to place on record my appreciation of their very hard work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report is the culmination of a lot of hard work. Those of us on the government side dedicated ourselves to a thorough examination of the legislation. The important finding of this rigorous examination was that the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  ought be passed by the parliament. It has the support of all the state and territory governments in this country. There were many witnesses who asked us not to go quite as far as we had in the legislation; other witnesses said that we ought to go a lot further. So what we have done as a government is to put up legislation which seeks to balance the competing interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor and some of its supporters have used very inflammatory language and run a campaign of disinformation which has unfortunately been picked up by other, albeit well&hyphen;meaning, community organisations. It is therefore timely that this report has come down. It enables a cool, calm analysis of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legislation without some of the hysteria that has been generated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me state for the record that the legislation is unambiguously beneficial to the indigenous community and indeed all Australians. Many of the amendments have bipartisan support: those that take into account the High Court decision in Brandy; the role proposed for the representative bodies; the enhanced role for the Native Title Tribunal, which hopefully will mean that a lot more agreements will be negotiated; the need for a rigorous threshold test; the need for indigenous land use agreements; the need for a statutory access regime; and so the list goes on. There are very real benefits in this bill for the indigenous community but also for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than concentrating on the things that might unite, Labor started off by stating before the first single word of evidence had been called that they would be writing and putting in a dissenting report. Our cooperative approach was shown by our making extra funds available for Labor to have professional assistance to write the dissenting report. It is very interesting to note that one of the people who wrote the report was none other than a Mr James Fitzgerald, who on 24 December 1996, the day after the Wik decision, held the exulted post of Cape York Land Council legal officer. This is what he had to say about the Wik decision:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no loser today. The rights of pastoralists are secure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On the same day the opposition spokesman for Aboriginal affairs, Mr Melham, said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What this judgment does today is confirm that all existing farm leases are valid and they can be extended on the same terms. What they had yesterday or five years ago they have still got today.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let us accept Mr Fitzgerald's and Mr Melham's comments on face value. If those comments are to be accepted on face value, why is it that on page 6 of their minority report they concede the point that we need a definition of pastoral purposes for the Native Title Act, and indeed they suggest their own, which&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;includes a provision for farm stay tourism? Why, I pose to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8238"> Labor senators, does the Native Title Act need to be amended to allow for that if what Mr Fitzgerald and Mr Melham said on 23 December, the day of the Wik decision, was in fact correct? The fact is that Mr Fitzgerald and Mr Melham misunderstood the Wik decision. As a result, they made comments on the very day it came down, and now they have authored and signed respectively a report which acknowledges that there are some very important and fundamental amendments required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time is very short, but the important point to understand is that the amendments that are being proposed are unambiguously beneficial to the indigenous community. They are unambiguously beneficial to all Australians. I recommend the report to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Abetz has made the point about it being `unambiguously beneficial' for all parties. That is clearly a nonsense. The Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 &mdash;and this will be brought up later on when we hear the report in relation to the Legal and Constitutional Committee's inquiry into the constitutionality of the bill&mdash;will be shot to shreds in light of the evidence.

None of us have certainty. None of us have the right to legal certainty necessarily.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the restructure of the Australian Wheat Board brings to fruition a process dating back to 1989 aimed at putting ownership and control of wheat marketing firmly in growers' hands. This will enable industry to control its own future without the restrictions of Government control and regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is pleased to acknowledge that the restructure of the Australian Wheat Board has been driven by the grains industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The push for change started in 1989, when industry commenced building up funds for a capital base for a future grower owned Australian Wheat Board via 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8239"> a levy on wheat sales, paid into the Wheat Industry Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1991 at the Grains 2000 conference, industry, through the Grains Council of Australia, recognised that the Australian Wheat Board needed greater flexibility to be best able to respond to changes in international marketing in order to compete successfully and maximise returns to growers. Further, the industry acknowledged that a marketing structure which is fully commercially driven is best achieved if it is owned and controlled by industry rather than by Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1992, the wheat industry entered into a compact with the then Government for change. Specifically, the industry agreed that Government underwriting of Australian Wheat Board borrowings should cease in 1999 and for the Wheat Industry Fund to continue to be built up over that period towards a target figure of $500&hyphen;550 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was decided that $500&hyphen;550 million would provide sufficient backing for the Australian Wheat Board to borrow the funds it requires to make harvest payments to growers without a Government guarantee. It would also fund other Australian Wheat Board activities such as domestic grain trading and value adding activities in grain storage and processing overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At Grains Week in April 1996, industry and Government agreed that wheat marketing arrangements post 1999 should be based on the objectives of grower ownership and control, self reliance and a fully commercial approach to marketing. At that same time, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy asked industry to develop a plan which would ensure that this goal would be met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To assist in this, a Grains Council of Australia/Australian Wheat Board/Department of Primary Industries and Energy Working Group was formed to facilitate industry consideration of possible restructuring. The membership of the group included representatives from all Grains Council of Australia State affiliate organisations so that growers would have the opportunity to put forward their views.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, to provide stability throughout the restructuring process, the Government reiterated its commitment to retain the export monopoly and for the National Competition Policy Review to be delayed until 1999/2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After much consultation and deliberation, in March 1997 the Working Group put to Government an agreed framework for a new structure. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is pleased that the Government has readily been able to accept this framework, which he announced at Grains Week in April 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1 July 1999, wheat marketing will be undertaken not by the current statutory Australian Wheat 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Board but by a grower owned and controlled company operating under Corporations Law. The company will assume responsibility for all commercial aspects of wheat marketing, including financing and operation of wheat pools.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new organisation will comprise a holding company with two subsidiaries: a pooling subsidiary and a domestic trading subsidiary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shares in the holding company will be issued in two classes: one A&hyphen;class share will be issued to each grower and the Wheat Industry Fund will be converted to B&hyphen;class shares. B&hyphen;class shares will be issued to Wheat Industry Fund equity holders on the basis of one share for every unit in the Wheat Industry Fund and will provide the company's capital base.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A&hyphen;class shares will be issued only to wheat growers. They will be non&hyphen;transferable and redeemed as holders leave the industry or fail to qualify as a wheat grower. A&hyphen;class shares will confer voting rights to elect the majority of directors of the holding company, and hence control of the holding company. They will not attract dividends or other returns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the providers of equity, B&hyphen;class shareholders will have the right to elect a minority of directors and will receive a commercial rate of return.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To achieve this structure by 1 July 1999, the restructuring of the Australian Wheat Board will require legislative change in two stages, now and in 1998. This bill represents stage one.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, before outlining in detail the key elements of the bill, so that there can be no doubt, let me make clear that the amendments contained in this bill in no way threaten the security of the export monopoly&mdash;it will continue to be enshrined in the legislation. The export monopoly is a fundamental part of both National Party policy and Coalition policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until 30 June 1999, responsibility for the export monopoly will rest with the Australian Wheat Board. Thereafter, the export monopoly will continue to be provided for in legislation. An independent regulatory mechanism will also be established to manage and monitor the performance of the export monopoly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, turning now to the bill itself, it addresses the following key areas:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the transitional provisions to apply until 30 June 1999;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the cessation of the Wheat Industry Fund levy in 1999; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the composition of the board of the Australian Wheat Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transitional Provisions to Apply Until 30 June 1999  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8240">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In broad terms, the transitional provisions of the bill provide for the redistribution of current Australian Wheat Board functions between the Australian Wheat Board, a new holding company, and two subsidiaries, a pooling and domestic trading subsidiary. In the bill, the companies are referred to as Company `A', Company `B' and Company `C' respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The holding company will be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Australian Wheat Board. It will be this company which in 1999 will become the grower owned and controlled company, with a capital base provided by the Wheat Industry Fund, distributed as shares to growers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the new company structure is to allow the holding company, as the future grower owned company, to develop an operational and financial track record over the next two years. It will be able to develop its own identity in international capital markets so that it can be competitive in the marketplace for borrowing in its own right for its activities from 1 July 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The structure also addresses a key concern of growers by providing for a distinct separation of wheat pooling activities from other trading activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objective is for the holding company and its associated subsidiaries to be operational as soon as possible to allow the future grower owned company the maximum amount of time possible to develop a track record. The memorandum and articles of association for the companies for the period to 1999 have been agreed with industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the commencement of these arrangements, the operating functions of the Australian Wheat Board will be reduced. In essence, the primary functions of the Australian Wheat Board will be management of the export monopoly; management of the Wheat Industry Fund; and overseeing the activities of its subsidiary, the holding company. The Australian Wheat Board will be accountable to both industry and Parliament for performance of these functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the holding company will be a commercial company operating under Corporations Law. It will assume the overarching responsibility for the pooling and commercial operations of the current Australian Wheat Board, including trade in wheat and grain and value adding activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pooling operations will be carried out by Company B. The bill provides for the holding company to undertake borrowings, on behalf of its pools subsidiary, for the purpose of pool related payments, with such borrowings to be guaranteed by the Commonwealth until 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The holding company will also establish a domestic trading subsidiary, Company C, to carry out the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> grain trading functions currently undertaken by the Australian Wheat Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, to ensure that the Wheat Industry Fund reaches its target of $550m in 1999 and provides a sound capital base for the new company, the tax provisions of the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 will continue to apply. Specifically, the operations of the Australian Wheat Board, the Wheat Industry Fund and the pooling subsidiary will continue to be free from income tax until 30 June 1999. However, consistent with the Government's Competitive Neutrality policy, normal income tax arrangements will apply to non&hyphen;pooling activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cessation of the Wheat Industry Fund Levy</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the cessation of the Wheat Industry Fund component of the levy on 30 June 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wheat Industry Fund now stands at around $430m and there is a possibility it could exceed $550m in mid 1999 if current strong prices and production levels continue. The financial consultants advise that the Wheat Industry Fund of $550m would allow the new company to fund the current range and level of services provided by the Australian Wheat Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second phase of legislative change, to be introduced in 1998, will provide that on 1 July 1999, ten years after the commencement of the Wheat Industry Fund, equity in the Fund will be transferred to growers, the rightful owners, in the form of B class shares in the holding company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Composition of the Board of the Australian Wheat Board</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for amendment to various sections of the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 relating to the board of the Australian Wheat Board. Specifically, current members will continue to serve on the board until November 1998 when their present term of appointment expires.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thereafter, the bill provides for the appointment of not more than eleven members to the board. In light of the reduced functions of the Australian Wheat Board from the commencement of these arrangements and to provide maximum flexibility in the appointments process in November 1998, the bill does not specify the actual size of the board, only a maximum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, given that there will be only a seven month period during which new members will need to be appointed, a selection committee process will not be required. The rationale behind this is simply to minimise the costs, ultimately borne by growers, associated with appointments.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the final step towards a Corporations Law company under grower ownership and control will be taken in 1998 by way of a second package of legislation.

It will also provide for the stripping away of all the commercial provisions for wheat marketing which will not be needed after an independent, grower owned company assumes these functions in 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thereafter, the restrictive, paternalistic role of Government will cease and the destiny of the industry will be placed firmly in growers' hands. From 1 July 1999, the industry will stand on its own two feet. The only Government involvement will be in relation to the export monopoly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments contained in this bill, and those to be introduced next year, finalise the restructure of wheat marketing and will stand industry in good stead for the future as an internationally competitive industry which continues to make a significant contribution to the Australian and rural economies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we adjourned this debate last night there had been a suggestion, by way of an observation made in the chamber by Senator Harradine, about the amendment that had just been lost on the voices. It was the amendment I had moved concerning the discretion of the Prime Minister to refer the opposition's policies for costing to the Treasury and/or Department of Finance, my amendment being for that discretion to be curtailed so that the Leader of the Opposition would be able to directly approach the departmental secretaries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the defeat of that amendment, Senator Harradine made an observation, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which is set out in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, that there may be a way of resolving the issue in dispute; namely, that the Prime Minister should not exercise discretion over what parts&mdash;whether whole or some part&mdash;of an opposition policy should be referred. If the opposition wanted its policy referred then all of those policies should be referred, and it would be inappropriate for the Prime Minister to pry into the detail of opposition policy before it was referred. The timing of the reference was also a matter of some crucial significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine suggested that some provision may be able to be worked up and agreed to that would mean the appearance of things would be maintained and the Prime Minister's ability to interfere would be put beyond question&mdash;that is, he would not interfere. That would require some automatic transmission by him so that the convention that the Prime Minister directs the Public Service, even in the caretaker phase of government, could be protected. The goal that the opposition was seeking could then also be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since that suggestion was made we have been busily working on a form of words. We believe we have got there, but we have not had the opportunity to disclose it widely at this stage. We wish to do so privately to the government, to the minor parties and to Senator Harradine now that we believe we have the right set of words that captures the spirit of the chamber last night. We hope to do that in order to speed through the issue of debate rather than have an argument about it here, because there was, I thought, a willingness on behalf of everyone to act in that manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the government's position, as articulated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator Ian Campbell, is that they would be prepared to look at this but that&mdash;I think these were his words to Senator Harradine&mdash;they would not artificially inflate Senator Harradine's hopes. He said that there was no other guarantee to do anything about it. Generally, it was a bleak observation from the government in terms of a hopeful outcome. But I took him to be prudent in those circumstances and trust that what we have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8242"> drafted might even meet the rigorous and somewhat defensive mood of the government on this occasion. I make that as an explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the amendment has been circulated. It seems to me to be therefore appropriate to suggest that we proceed to other amendments and come back to this so that there is a chance for the matter to be properly considered at some leisure. I object to matters being sprung on me at the last moment, and I am sure that everyone else does too. I thought leaving this aside and coming back to it before we complete the committee stage would be a reasonable way to proceed. Having made that explanation, I want an indication as to whether or not that is agreed to so that I can move to my next amendments.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment proposes to add new subclauses 29(6) and 29(7), which will grant the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> responsible secretaries a discretion to decline to provide advice when this would include policy advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for this discretion is that during the election period the bureaucracy is not allowed to provide policy advice to the government. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for the bureaucracy to provide policy advice to the Leader of the Opposition during the election period either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We therefore propose that the discretion be left in the hands of the relevant departmental secretary: if in the secretary's opinion he or she considers a request to be one seeking policy advice as opposed to a policy costing, then they can rightfully decline to undertake the request to the extent that it encompasses policy advice. This ensures that the bureaucracy is not compromised between serving the government of the day and providing information to the opposition by way of a policy costing request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further change the opposition seeks, via a new subsection 7, is to ensure that any request made by the Leader of the Opposition to seek a costing is private so that the opposition has the same advantage as that of the government. If the government is truly committed to the democratic process&mdash;they say they are&mdash;then they would agree to this measure, which seeks to introduce some balance by ensuring that both the government and the opposition have access to professional and private advice as regards to each party's policy costings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is totally undemocratic and flies in the face of open public debate if opposition costings cannot be guaranteed privacy to enable the Leader of the Opposition to release the costings at a time of his or her choosing. The two subclauses 29(6) and 29(7) set out in a way better read than explained exactly what the amendments are. I commend them to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This reveals the problem that Senator Cook is walking the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="r242">Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996</XREF>  into. The whole purpose of the Leader of the Opposition electing to have his policies costed is that they are the policies he is going to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8243"> people with and he presumably wants confirmation of the costings of that particular policy. The rules equally apply if the Leader of the Government wishes to put policies to be costed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing is another attempt by the Labor Party to involve the Treasury in policy work. What this would mean is that the Leader of the Opposition could put a variety of policies to Treasury, Treasury could cost them and then the opposition could make its choice. That involves the Treasury in policy work, which Senator Cook pretends that he does not wish to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first part of the clause allows declining to prepare costings. Think of the pressure on the Treasury when, for example, the Leader of the Opposition puts forward a range of tax options and wishes to obtain costings from the Treasury for those options so that the opposition can decide what it wants to do. This is not the purpose of the legislation. You go to the people, you develop your policies and, if you want Treasury to certify those policies, you get them costed. That is the purpose of it. If you do not wish to have Treasury cost them, you may stand or fall by it, but it is entirely your option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe this is another attempt by the opposition to involve the Treasury in work of a political nature in the pressure cooking atmosphere of an election period. The idea is that parties develop their policies and then their policies can be costed by Treasury if they wish. But it is not for them to put a range of options to Treasury and then decide, after consideration, that they will choose option A rather than option B.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This approach by the opposition is taking this bill into an area where it was never intended to go. The reality is that, if this facility is available, the opposition will be able to load the Treasury with a whole range of work&mdash;work which is properly the work of the opposition, not the work of Treasury. It is not the work of a body which, after all, will have limited resources. I believe this would greatly multiply the amount of work which would be put to the Treasury&mdash;all in the pressure cooker atmosphere of an election.

We are talking about a situation where the  parliament is prorogued. Therefore, a lot of the normal day-to-day work of Treasury would be different from that normally directed to it by the respective ministers of other departments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have to take into consideration the fact that Treasury have specific models. If various options were put to them for costings, it may well be a matter of simply dialling in different numbers or different levels to get responses. A model or spreadsheet may be put forward for which a similar model already exists, depending on the options that have been put forward. If there were several different options within one tax model, for instance, I imagine it would be a matter of changing the figures to get out a difference response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been said quite a lot during history that the best government is formed on the basis of the best opposition. In the interests of good government, one would think it would be hard for a sensible government not to want the highest level of challenge to them and their policies. When policies come forward as alternatives, it sharpens everybody to make sure that those things are well thought out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not seen Senator Cook's proposal on which he spent all night working in relation to executive power. Quite frankly, the government are saying that they are doing something new. Between us we probably have to work out exciting ways in which we can all be more effective and more accountable&mdash;governments, opposition and minor parties. It seems bizarre that governments will be able to give out information about non-government policies if that is not the wish of the non-government parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would think there would be many, many things that the Treasury are asked to do where permission is not given and where details are not automatically made public. Perhaps the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) can 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8244"> enlighten me. Is it the case that everything that is put to Treasury for costing by the government is automatically made public? If that is not the case, there is obviously a precedent. I might be wrong, but I would have thought that many requests put to Treasury were not automatically published. If that is the case, perhaps that way of doing things extends the costings of opposition parties.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasury does a huge amount of work, and not all that work is publicly available. That has nothing to do with the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="r242">Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996</XREF> . Clause 31 of the bill states that secretaries are to publicly release the costings. Public transparency is the key object of the bill. This seems to be heading in the direction that much of it will be kept out of public scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not for Treasury to help develop the policies of the opposition; it is up to the opposition to develop its policies. Having developed its policies, it then decides what policies it wishes to have costed. It will want to do that because it is confident of those policies. It has done its work properly, and therefore it wants the Secretary to the Treasury to release the Treasury costings. That is the purpose of it. It is not for the opposition or anyone else to load Treasury with a whole range of options during an election process so that it can help with its policy development. That is the nature of the beast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, this clause would be utterly inconsistent with clause 31. The aim of the bill is to ensure transparency. The thrust of this amendment is to keep the process secret, not to involve Treasury in policy work, which is what Senator Cook seems to want to do.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we could address subclause (7) of opposition amendment No. 13, that is where the real issue arises. I thought that when Senator Cook had made his argument with regard to the earlier amendments&mdash;No. 6 on sheet No. 362 (revised) and No. 9 which concerns the matters that Senator Harradine referred to as already argued and won last night&mdash;he specifically said that the opposition would put a policy forward to be costed, would establish that the costing indicated that the policy should not proceed on that basis and that it might go backwards and forwards a few times until they had arrived at a costing and a policy balance which made it possible for them to go out to the people and say, `Right, this is the policy and these are the cost consequences.' I take that to mean that once the final decision has been made&mdash;that that is the policy and that is the costing&mdash;it will be ready for the public announcement, which to my mind, and as Senator Harradine rightly points out, is adequately covered in clause 31 of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Cook is saying is that the natural process of arriving at the finality of a costing requires you to have several goes at it to evaluate the final outcome, which government would do naturally on its side of things and so the opposition wants the same approach. I think that is a perfectly reasonable way to proceed. I do not think Senator Cook said at any time that when they are ready to go they would not want it to be public or for the costings to be public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my mind, that is covered in clause 31, and that, I assume, is the reason why you 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8246"> have not tried to amend clause 31: it is the substantive clause which results in the very outcome for which the bill is intended. If my interpretation is correct, Minister, as is Senator Harradine's&mdash;and we wait to hear from Senator Cook&mdash;I think frankly your fears are overstated. I look forward to hearing your answer.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I say, without cooking my cabbages three times, that Senator Harradine has explained it accurately, Senator Murray has explained it accurately and that, for the record, I understand clause 31 to mean that the secretaries are bound to release costings. The point of this amendment that the government finds offensive is that to some extent the Leader of the Opposition in the election campaign period wants to be able to have some influence over the timing. Once he or she has got the costings, they will want to release them at the propitious time. That does not absolve the fact that the secretaries will be required to release them before polling day&mdash;as they should.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the second section is about that&mdash;the costings will become public and people will discriminate in respect of those costings. There just cannot be some slavish agenda here that removes the element of best presentation of party policy from the opposition. It is an element that the government will have too. Both parties will be equal in this, and I think that is reasonable. In any case, there seems to be no offence taken at subclause (6) in which the departmental secretaries can decline, as they ought to be able to do, if they are being asked to give policy advice.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8249"> and the intent. But we feel very strongly that it is very important, particularly in the written form in which election statements are made&mdash;you can expect people to stumble in the verbal form&mdash;that there is a real intention and an admonition to ensure that statements of fact are not inaccurate or untrue or are likely to be misleading or deceptive. Senators would be familiar with equivalent legislation in the South Australian jurisdiction. It has worked very effectively for 10 years or more. It has been taken to the Supreme Court and has been found to work effectively, under those court judgments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we think that in a charter of budget honesty this is in fact an explicit admonition to those providing policies and costings in writing in terms of the act to ensure that the statement of fact is not inaccurate, or untrue, or likely to be misleading or deceptive. We would have, frankly, accompanied it with a penalty. But there is little point if in fact the bill as a whole is not enforceable. So I have tried to make it as easy as possible for the Senate to support, if in fact they regard this bill as a statement of political morality and the ability to provide the practical exposition of that political morality.</PARA></SPEECH>

The issue of culpability, which is involved in this area of `knowing', has all to do with whether or not it can be enforced.

Because of the decision of the Senate earlier that this bill not be enforceable, as it is in New Zealand with the Fiscal Responsibility Act and as a number of senators in this place wished it to be, I cannot, within a clause, introduce elements of enforceability. That point was strongly and clearly made last night by the minister. So, in consequence, I am forced to put an exhortation as opposed to a punishable offence.

As a consequence, you cannot put penalties for a breach of the act, if becomes an act, in the bill. It makes a nonsense of it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment that Senator Murray has put forward does relate to the remainder of the bill. It is trying to prevent people from knowingly printing, publishing or distributing pamphlets and so on related to the matters in this bill&mdash;that is, the charter of honesty&mdash;dishonestly. It is directly related to the integral part of the legislation. What is the point of having a charter of honesty if we then do not have any attempt to prohibit people from dishonestly distributing leaflets, for example, about the outcome of Treasury's assessment of what the parties are doing? I think it is a really worthwhile component of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are going to invoke the argument that it is not enforceable because of a vote by the other side of the House earlier in the piece, you withdraw the whole piece of legislation on that point. If you do not stand by that argument, Senator Murray's amendment is a very worthy addition to this piece of legislation. It will help keep politicians on their toes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue of electoral advertising is obviously very important because many things can be put out at any stage during an election which become very difficult after an election. It is well known that one of the things you do is make a statement with people unable to fight back and, of course, that has happened. We have heard it reported many times that unfair statements were made at a time when, no matter what the truth was, it was impossible to refute. It is very important that at some stage, perhaps when we are dealing with electoral matters, we deal not just with the matters covered in this charter but with matters in general relating to electoral advertising. There is no reason why it should just be matters covering this charter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to plead guilty to the fact that it was not just people on the other side of the chamber who voted against the enforceability of the charter. I made a decision, which was for me a slightly tough decision, that there were so many aspects of this charter which were patently dishonest that it would be, for my part, dishonest to support them as being a charter of budget honesty. Therefore, I could not, in conscience, create an enforceable charter which I believe is largely dishonest in the way it presents figures, and which could end up beating people over the head with what, in effect, is one line which pretends there is only one way of thinking about the way we value things in our society.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This proposal is for a new clause that will seek to equalise the opportunity afforded to both the government and the opposition when it comes to the analysis of the cost implications of each party's proposed policies. What this proposal essentially seeks to do is give the opposition at any time prior to the caretaker period the same opportunity enjoyed by the government to develop policy options in a manner that both is responsible and has regard to the public interest when it comes to the costing of policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It allows the Leader of the Opposition to seek the assistance of the responsible secretaries to advise on and cost policy options provided: first, the responsible secretaries have the discretion to decline any request where it would impose an unreasonable workload on the department; second, the request by the leader may relate to costings and revenue estimates and may include policy advice; third, the leader may at any time withdraw a request that has been made by notice in writing to the secretary; and, fourth, any request made by the leader may not be disclosed by the secretary to any person unless authorised to do so by the leader.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the importance the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has personally attached to an open and transparent policy costing process it is imperative that, for this new proposed regime to have any credibility, both the opposition and the government be on an equal footing in this process. This amendment seeks to do that. If the policy costing process is to be done on an unequal footing, essentially on terms laid down by the government, the quality of public debate to flow from the process will be diminished and become overtly politicised, which I would have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thought the government would be seeking to avoid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this amendment we also realise that it is not desirable to have the opposition embark upon endless requests for costings on particular options. Therefore, we have proposed that the relevant secretary have the discretion to decline assistance being afforded to the opposition where this would unduly impose an unreasonable workload on the department. This is a far more sensible and fairer approach than leaving it in the hands of the Prime Minister as to whether the opposition policy option should be costed or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have stated previously, if the government does seriously want to improve the quality of the options and proposals the people are to assess the merits of either party against, then opposition parties ought to be able to explore these options properly before committing themselves to the public domain. It is important that opposition parties have the opportunity to get their costings right. This amendment seeks to do just that. I commend the amendment.

It would put the secretary in an incredibly difficult position if he had to say that he would not do particular work that the opposition was seeking him to do.

We have to distinguish between the opposition's view of how it wants things to develop, the government's view of what the opposition is trying to develop, and what the rest of us have been voting through. Both Senator Harradine and I explained it in our own separate ways. Essentially, my view is that the opposition should be capable of going to the secretaries and saying, `Here is a policy; cost it,' looking at the costing and saying, `Well, that means we have to vary the policy' or `We have to do something about the costings,' and arriving at a situation eventually where the policy they put up is practical and the costing appropriate.

In other words, the options could be two directly different policies. That is not what we are really trying to achieve. My view is that the opposition, in my example, would say, `We have decided not to sell Telstra' and cost that, or their policy would be to sell Telstra and to cost it&mdash;but not to offer both up and pick the one which is appropriate for them.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The issue of enforceability of the bill as a whole has been decided upon but I move this amendment as an alternative to that proposed by the Democrats in the first instance. I particularly look forward to Senator Margetts's response since she had a view of the bill as a whole which might not extend to parts 7 and 8 of the bill, which are affected by this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the opposition will understand this to be an amendment that takes account of and accords with some of the concerns expressed by the coalition and various sides of the house in the earlier debate. The amendment will have the effect of making pre&hyphen;election reports on the fiscal and economic outlook and policy costings enforceable in judicial and other proceedings. At the moment, under the current legislation, the non&hyphen;publication of these reports and costings could not be subject to judicial or similar proceedings. Unlike the other parts to this bill, parts 7 and 8, which are proposed to be enforceable under this amendment, are clearly separate from any executive power of the Commonwealth to follow whatever fiscal strategy it deems necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the coalition have been saying, in their earlier arguments against making the bill as a whole enforceable, is that that would make very difficult their ability to have a flexible approach&mdash;and I am paraphrasing my interpretation of what you said&mdash;in terms of overall fiscal strategy. What I am proposing with this amendment is that only the fiscal reporting requirements and pre&hyphen;election costings aspects of the bill be made enforceable in judicial or other proceedings. If you return to the bill, those are the sections covered from pages 17 to 24.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parts 7 and 8 do not impact on the discretion of the executive government, in caretaker mode, to run the national economy. One of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8255"> the government's strong arguments for not making the bill as a whole enforceable, as it is in New Zealand, was that they felt that their discretion would be improperly interfered with. I do not accept that argument, but I accept that I lost the vote in the Senate. I am now attending to areas where the bureaucrats and others are obliged to perform in terms of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not aware&mdash;and perhaps the Senate can acquaint me with the possibility&mdash;of any bill which is not enforceable. I have never seen one. Maybe there are some but I am certainly not aware of them. This bill is unique.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like those sections capable of enforceability to be made so. As it stands, this bill is overly protective of the executive government at the expense of the parliament and the public. By accepting this amendment, in place of the one which I proposed earlier covering the whole bill, the government would be reinforcing its commitment to the electorate to improve fiscal accountability. At the same time, it would not be encroaching, in any way, on the ability and constitutional right and precedent of the executive government to run the national economy as it saw fit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I challenge the government&mdash;I do not hold my breath, because they tend to reject good ideas as well as bad&mdash;to take up this opportunity to demonstrate to the Australian electorate just how serious they are about the right of the electorate to be informed about fiscal and economic outlooks and policy costings, so much so that there is the ability for that outlook and policy to be enforceable with regard to pre&hyphen;election outlooks in part 7 and costing of election commitments in part 8. This is about making sure there is real honesty and real commitment in this bill and about improving the trust of the electorate in government, politicians and the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would draw your attention to the areas excluded: part 1, purpose and overview; part 2, interpretation; part 3, principles of sound fiscal management; part 4, fiscal strategy statement; part 5, annual government reporting; and part 6, intergenerational report. Those would remain unenforceable. We 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> believe those are the areas where the government has expressed its need to exercise discretion. Part 7 and part 8 merely relate to the functionality, if you like, of producing the intention of the bill. Accordingly, I commend this amendment to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, Senator Margetts, the responsible secretaries did not do what they were required to do under parts 7 and 8 of the act, as would be the case under other legislation, they would be responsible.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the point of that if at the end of the day they have no other obligation than to furnish information? If it is not responsible, it is not correct and some devious mechanism is used which means deceit to the public, there is no enforceability.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> players in rural politics and they do not have a brief from farmers. On the other hand, Don McGauchie has been re&hyphen;elected for a fourth term as NFF president. This would not have happened had he not enjoyed considerable confidence from the rural community. Asa Wahlquist described his re&hyphen;election as extraordinary. That is to insult NFF voters and only goes to prove that the basic premise of the article is without foundation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Farley, on the other hand, is very much out of favour in the bush. It is quite wrong to put him up as an expert on rural opinion, yet it is obvious that Farley is the major source of this article. Rick Farley is developing into a spoiler in the interests which he once tried to represent. There is nothing new in his position to warrant the excited introduction which claimed that a growing number of rural groups are breaking ranks. Mr Farley is not a rural group but a native title negotiator whose views are already well&hyphen;known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The strategy is clear: try to discredit a chief spokesman on the opposite side, in order to win the debate. Go for the eyes and try to hit the pivot, in the hope of crippling your opposition. In this case, if you take McGauchie out, you leave the farmers without their strongest voice on native title. That is the object of this article. That is the reason behind the choice of the article.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A former rural group office holder, Mr John Purcell, is also quoted. Mr Purcell will find it difficult to live down the role he played in the Cape York agreement because it has caused so much bad feeling among pastoralists, both black and white, on the cape and has failed to move forward. Strangely, Mr Purcell seems to have changed his tune on extinguishment since he voted in favour of the NFF's policy at a meeting in January 1997. It should also be noted that the NFF has nothing against voluntary agreements for traditional access. This has long been its policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that the article is designed to undermine the farmers' champion on the native title issue, and it does so in a very one&hyphen;sided way. Unlike the days under Rick Farley's mantle, when there was considerable unrest in the membership ranks over the NFF's direction and closeness with the Labor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8260"> administration, the NFF has widespread support for its stance on native title. The article in fact mentioned by name the many supporters of the NFF such as the United Graziers Association in Queensland, the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association and the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These groups represent many thousands of those directly affected by native title legislation. These are the major stakeholders in the native title debate in the farming community. Yet the author failed to provide any comment from these organisations to balance the feature. Only disparaging comments were quoted at length, and those who made them do not even represent any rural group. The feature reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are 28 State farming and commodity groups in the NFF, representing 115,000 farmers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet the author could not find one current representative of any of these bodies to support her hypothesis that rural groups were breaking ranks with the NFF. There was no backup to this beat&hyphen;up. The only critics the author could find were three former representatives, each now with there own axe to grind, and a mining representative&mdash;not a farmer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be very obvious that mining companies are in a totally different position to family farmers when it comes to negotiating and to legal and financial resources. There is no comparison. In addition, large mining companies can simply walk away if negotiations fail to come up with a commercially viable solution. That is not so with farming families and grazing families. Where can they go? They cannot walk off and start up overseas instead, as mining companies can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The feature was entitled `Cultivating fear'. It was the Wik decision alone which created the fear, the anxiety and the depression felt by so many in the bush. Rural families once trusted Rick Farley to deliver them certainty of tenure and title. Who can blame them now for being sceptical about the ramifications of forced coexistence in a land ownership regime which recognises two different types of title on one property?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">McGauchie is right to be strong on this issue&mdash;here we are so far into the debate and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> still no&hyphen;one knows what native title means. So much hinges on this. How could the leader of Australian farmers sign off on a deal when there are still so many crucial unknowns that will affect his constituents&mdash;so many court cases yet to come, so much money yet to be spent; time and worry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The author of the feature presents the argument that all farmers are being branded rednecks for the sake of only a few thousand pastoral leases. How principled a leader would McGauchie be if he were to treat one section of the constituency different from the others?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no wonder that there is fear. In one of the most recent native title claims in areas of the Sunshine Coast north of Brisbane, the Undanbi people continue to use the language of claiming exclusive possession, with ongoing rights to occupation, use and enjoyment, and of determining the future of the land, water and resources to the exclusion of all others. Point (f) of their application claims a right to live on and erect residences and other infrastructure on the land.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The Meat Industry Council is nearing the end of its statutory term and is winding down its operations as the industry prepares for the implementation of the new red meat board, which the government has put legislation forward to set up. During the transition period, the Meat Industry Council will maintain a monitoring role in a number of programs while overseeing the handover. It will certainly keep an eye on the meat industry strategic plan, which it has been instrumental in fostering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It goes without saying that the beef industry is one of Australia's most important agricultural industries. Over recent years it has contributed between 11 and 19 per cent of the gross value of agricultural production, and that is about $3 billion worth of export income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along with wool, the beef industry is Australia's most dispersed agricultural industry, reaching from the far north of north&hyphen;western Western Australia to the hobby farmers in the south, and it is an industry that has played an enormous role in regional Australia and has developed much of our hinterland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Its impact is very important to all those people who are employed in trucking and other areas of the transport industry, as well as in the production of feed, feedlotting, grain production and the abattoirs. A whole range of related employment in country towns depends substantially on the beef industry. Its prosperity is essential because over the last 25 years the industry has faced many challenges that have substantially altered the focus of production and the financial performance of the individual producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of the industry has come under major financial, economic and market pressures, and that has been especially so over the last few years. These pressures have not all been the responsibility of government. They have often been the result of drought, falling cattleyard prices in response to increased production in the United States, increasing competition in our export markets and, of course, recent food safety scares worldwide which have impacted on the amount of red meat that is being 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consumed. Inefficiencies on our waterfront and in our abattoirs have had a very detrimental effect on our export performance, and the cost price squeeze over recent years has affected all primary producers and not just beef producers. There has also been a corruption of world markets and a lack of access to markets, especially European markets and, at certain times, markets in North America. An overall trend has been a lack of growth in our own domestic markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has recently announced the new meat industry board which will be a producer&hyphen;owned body with responsibility for the sheep and beef industries, including promotion, research and development of both those red meats.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Meat Industry Council will no longer exist and, as such, we move forward. This is probably not the last annual report, as there will be another one for this financial year, but I note the important role the Meat Industry Council has played. But the baton is shortly to be passed to a grower&hyphen;controlled board. With that change we can look forward to a more efficient meat industry and, with good seasons and an expanding international market, I think the prospects are improving all the time.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8262">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would like to highlight a couple of pieces out of this report, especially as they relate to Lithgow and the ADI factory there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very pleasing to see that the Lithgow factory has completed the manufacture of 94,000 Steyr rifles for the Australian and New Zealand defence forces, plus 7,627 Minimi light support weapons for the Australian Army. But the future of the plant in terms of manufacturing is concerning, given that the Minimi has been completed and at this stage there do not seem to be any new major contracts on the horizon. There was potential for one in Thailand, but I would suspect that, with the problems prior to this and with the problems of the last couple of weeks with the Thai baht and the Asian financial crisis, that is becoming remote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The business in Lithgow was a strong contributor to the profits of 1997, and it has reduced its operations in Lithgow to a business manufacturing spare parts for weapons. It says this will enable the core capability to be profitably  maintained for a year or two while overseas business continues to be pursued.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish it well, because there is a very dynamic work force there. It is now very small&mdash;it has been downsized quite considerably&mdash;but it is a dynamic work force that is prepared to be innovative and to move into cutting edge technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have made an inspection of the plant over the last 12 months and know that the management and the workers are very concerned about their futures. The previous downsizing at Lithgow was the forerunner of a number of downsizes that have taken place in a number of industries in that area, one of which was the closure of the Berlei factory, with retrenchment of over 100 workers. This instability is a result of the government's TCF policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen the downsizing of the Baal Bone colliery and the closure or downsizing&mdash;I am not sure which; it is a bit hard to read from the media, but there are a lot of people to be retrenched&mdash;of the Clarence colliery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These circumstances are putting big pressure upon Lithgow. This is a dynamic centre. It is a centre of heavy industry. It is a centre 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with people who have good skills. If you look at the number of retrenchments that have occurred in Lithgow in the last 12 months on a per capita or pro rata basis, it has had more than has Newcastle. But getting this government to take any cognisance of that is almost impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a community, a council area with a population size of 12,000 to 15,000. It is not small; it is not huge. But it is significant in terms of the regional area in which it is located and also its industries in which its main work force is located.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important for this government to realise that they must have a policy not just for regions&mdash;because they have gutted regional development; basically, with 12 staff within the department, it exists in name only&mdash;but also for industry. If this government had an industry policy, it would be able to slot very well into future programs of the ADI, into the corporatisation that this government is to undertake. Without looking really at any major future for it, this government are just going to flog it off. They are not going to look at it being a single unit, a single entity, and entering into agreements and partnerships with other industry bodies in the area. They are just going to let it drift off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is failing this country. In particular, it is failing communities like Lithgow as it does not have an industry policy. It has scrapped regional development as well. There will also be another impact, a big impact, upon all these people who have been, are about to be, or in the future will be, retrenched from the coal mines. That is the impact this government's changes will have on the treatment of social security payments and redundancy payments, and having to cash out and work out the additional time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will have major impacts upon people who are trying to pay off their mortgages and debts so that they are able to exist on newstart and make use of what limited training facilities there are. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The annual report of the CSIRO sets out a range of significant achievements for the year. Obviously, I am sure that we would all want to congratulate the CSIRO on another year of excellent results, especially at a time of fiscal restraint by this government&mdash;not to mention short-sightedness&mdash;in relation to the role of science and technology in our future. In fact, the small amount of time available to me tonight is not enough to focus on the range of achievements set out in this report. So I will just focus on what is a significant sector that the government should not overlook in its myopic funding decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats acknowledge the special need to save Australia's wildlife as being a key issue for Australian science as well as for our economic wellbeing in the future. Similarly, the CSIRO is committed to this goal, and the annual report sets out some of its achievements in reaching that particular objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The magnitude of the threat to Australian wildlife is total. The issue cannot be overstated. The threat is to individual species, whole ecosystems, and the potential of the planet to support life as we know it. The worldwide 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> estimates of extinction rates for species as a proportion of the total number of estimated species ranges from one to 11 per cent per decade; that is, about 100,000 species per year, or about another 20,000 species by the end of this year, will become extinct. This is pretty scary stuff. But what is perhaps a little sadder is that we have no record of many of these extinctions. They are gone forever, and their unique solution to biology's problems tend to be lost without trace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem for Australia is particularly severe. Australia is mega diverse, with high levels of endemic species. Already a large number of these species have been lost. In the last 200 years, some one in five mammals have become, or are at risk of becoming, extinct. Similar risks apply to higher flora for insects and the world of prokaryotes. The situation is pretty severe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's drive to cut education and research funding threatens the identification and preservation of Australia's unique wildlife. This is strongly acknowledged within the CSIRO. But, through science and appropriate technology, Australia could save this world heritage and genetic diversity. The CSIRO is central to this particular task, and I have to say that its record is particularly impressive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are direct and indirect benefits from preserving biodiversity. They range from crop yields to air and water quality. Unfortunately, conservation biology and the long&hyphen;term crisis of environmental overload does not seem to enter the present economic debate. In fact, the failure of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) even to mention science in last year's budget, I think, is an indictment of the government's understanding when it comes to the value of biological resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's vanishing wildlife must be saved by moves to recognise the crisis and take measures to halt the tragic loss. This is a message that the CSIRO is forever trying to get out, and many of our politicians&mdash;senators in this place and members in the lower House&mdash;attend regular CSIRO briefing seminars at which the importance of the role of science in the community as well as the need to save our natural heritage are explained.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8264">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the CSIRO on its commitment to this, and I cite as an example of its contribution towards improving our knowledge of our Australian biodiversity some of the publications that are listed, such as&mdash;now this is a test&mdash;the `Checklist of the Lepidoptera of Australia'.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8265">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In requesting the Senate to take note of this report, it is important for the Senate to recall the basis on which the Indigenous Land Corporation was in fact set up. Honourable senators may recall that this land fund was set up as part of the response of the federal government to the then Mabo decision. Indeed, it was discussed in this place in 1993 in conjunction with the Native Title Act 1993. A summary of that can be found in the comments of then Senator Sid Spindler on 15 December 1993, where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The High Court's Mabo judgment deals with the proof required to establish native title. The report from the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proof of the existence of native title is relatively difficult to establish. The elements include the need to show the existence of an identifiable community or group; that there be a traditional connection with the land under the laws and customs of the Aboriginal group; and that there has been a substantial maintenance of the connection since Crown sovereignty. These elements will place strict limits upon the making of successful claims to native title.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The then Senator Sid Spindler went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition of this difficulty, and the fact that over most usable land in Australia native title has been extinguished, this bill contains a provision for the establishment of a land acquisition fund . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So that is in fact the genesis of the Indigenous Land Corporation. Honourable senators may recall a previous speech I gave on the indigenous land fund and my concern that, in the whole topic of native title in this country and the submissions made by the national indigenous working group overseas in the context of native title, the indigenous land fund in fact was not mentioned. When I say `not mentioned', I mean that the extent of it is not mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be recalled by all Australians that what has been set up with the Indigenous Land Corporation is in fact a perpetual fund which, as of 1 July 1997, allows $45 million indexed to be drawn down for the Indigenous Land Corporation each and every year. The allocation to the fund at the end of 2004 will be $1.289 billion. Retained in the land fund at the end of that period will be $859 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that the contributions by the Australian taxpayers have been made 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in full and on time as per the requirement of the legislation. It is also good to see that the Indigenous Land Corporation has in fact been moving to undertake land purchases and the board has given approval to proceed to purchase a total of 45 properties, which, just by way of interest, include a range of properties from pastoral leaseholds to freehold title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The corporation I think give a full and detailed account of the way that they are administering their moneys. They raise one concern in their report at page 19 and then develop it further on pages 38 and 39, and that is the difficulty in Queensland of their being unable to buy grazing homestead freehold leases and grazing homestead perpetual leases because the Queensland legislation requires that those types of leases be held by individuals and operated in effect as family farms. Such leases may not be transferred to corporate ownership, and that of course includes the Indigenous Land Corporation. Therefore, we have the situation where the Indigenous Land Corporation, because of their structure, are unable to buy some of these leases in the state of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude my remarks this evening by simply urging the Queensland government to give consideration as to whether the regime can be altered to in fact allow the Indigenous Land Corporation to make such purchases for the benefit of the indigenous community within this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to talk about crime and punishment in the Northern Territory. I am referring to the Country Liberal Party government's mandatory sentencing provisions for property offences, which have totally skewed the scales of justice in the Territory. They came into effect on 8 March this year through amendments to the Sentencing Act and the Juvenile Justice Act. The amendments contain a schedule of offences, including car theft, criminal damage, breaking and entering and stealing, that result in compulsory imprisonment for convicted adult and juvenile offenders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For adults, it is one strike and you are in. I might add that an adult is someone 17 years and 28 days old. A first offence is met with an automatic 14 days imprisonment and it is 90 days gaol for a second offence and a minimum of a 12&hyphen;month prison term for repeat offences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For juveniles, it is two strikes and you are in. A magistrate must impose a period of at least 28 days detention on a juvenile, defined as anyone who is 15 or 16 years of age, who has been found guilty of one of the prescribed property offences and has at least one prior conviction for a similar offence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These mandatory sentencing laws enjoy the support of the majority of territorians. I am not among them. It is my earnest hope that a number of recent well&hyphen;publicised cases will force among territorians a major rethink about these laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One has recently changed his view. His name is Ray McCosker. He is a law&hyphen;abiding father of five. Mr McCosker was recently charged with criminal damage after admitting to police he cut a piece of steel off a chook shed which a neighbour had built onto his fence. He lived for months with the prospect 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8267"> of leaving his wife and five children at the front door of Darwin's Berrimah Prison until the charges against him were dropped on the grounds of insufficient evidence on the day he appeared in court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Others have not been so fortunate. Take the case of 23-year-old single mother Margaret Wynbyne. Margaret pleaded guilty to stealing a single can of beer, valued at $2.50, and unlawful entry at the Wanda Inn at Top Springs on 13 March this year. It was her first offence. Margaret, who was employed in a women's shelter at Kalkaringi, was sentenced to 14 days in prison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter is currently under appeal before a full bench of the Northern Territory Supreme Court. Her lawyers are arguing, as we would expect, that the punishment simply does not fit the crime. They have asked the full bench to quash the sentence and declare the sentencing law invalid as it violates international human rights and the Australian constitution. They argue that it corrupts the separation of powers between the parliament, the courts and the executive as enshrined in the constitution. The appeal is a test case against the mandatory sentencing laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, it has come too late for 17-year-old Matthew Bradley of suburban Leanyer in Darwin. Matthew left prison on 15 July this year after serving 14 days imprisonment for stealing yo-yos and computer games valued at $579 from a toy shop. The Darwin Magistrate's Court was told that Matthew is an above average student at St John's College and a first offender who had paid full restitution for the thefts and damage and had personally apologised to the manager of the store. In fact, Matthew had confessed to his father, who had taken him and the stolen objects to the police. So Matthew did the right thing, showed genuine remorse, confessed to a crime the police had no idea he had perpetrated and society dealt with him for doing this by sending him to prison for 14 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should point out that, to its credit, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory News</EMPHASIS>, despite the support in the territory, has consistently opposed the mandatory sentencing laws in its editorial columns. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Matthew Bradley was joined in prison earlier this year by 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Edward Brown, who had pleaded guilty to stealing fuel worth $9 from a car. Magistrate James Hannan indicated that he intended to fine him for the offence but imposed the gaol sentence when reminded by the police prosecutor that he had no discretion other than to do so. I can understand many territorians like Mr McCosker accepting the arguments of local politicians for mandatory sentencing. Territorians are fed a constant diet of crime stories and court reportage often centres on what, on face value, sometimes appears to be light sentencing by the judiciary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent pamphlet issued by the ruling Country Liberal Party claimed that the legislation was aimed at introducing tougher sentencing in the belief that this would act as a deterrent. The facts are that the weight of evidence both here and overseas shows that tougher sentencing or gaol terms does not act as a deterrent. But as Mr McCosker told a television interviewer last week, his support for mandatory sentencing was based on the view that going to gaol was something that happened to criminals not to ordinary people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The statistics do not bear out claims of a territory crime wave. They do not take into account the population growth. There has been no serious public debate on the link between poverty, unemployment and crime. In my view, the overwhelming evidence shows that mandatory sentencing results in punishments which in many cases far outweighs the crime, as evidenced by the examples I have highlighted tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a relatively new debate in Australia but it is not new in the United States, where mandatory sentencing was introduced in many states in the early 1970s. Imprisonment rates in America are now the highest in the world. It is interesting that the land of the free has the highest percentage of its citizens behind bars than any country in the world. But crime is not being reduced in the United States. Mandatory sentencing has been criticised all the way up the judicial chain in the US to the chairman of the US Sentencing Commission, Judge Richard Conaboy. He recently stated:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8268">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't think there's any system that invites more criticism than mandatory minimum sentencing, because you cannot fashion one sentence that fits every situation and every defendant and still take into consideration all of the aspects involved in every criminal act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In fact, a number of American judges have quit the bench in protest rather than impose mandatory sentences, and many others refuse to hear cases where mandatory sentencing is involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legal literature in the United States is littered with examples of the profound failure of these policies, which have seen the American prison population triple since 1980. The highest percentage of these increases in the prison population comprise young black Americans, mostly first time drug offenders. Perversely, in this same climate, many violent criminals are being released into the community to ease the overcrowding, with little or no supervision because of budget problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory already has the highest rate of imprisonment in Australia, with territorians imprisoned at the rate of three times the national average. There has been considerable press coverage on the already overcrowding problems at Berrimah Prison and there is a profound lack of juvenile facilities, with juveniles recently imprisoned in the new adult section of the Alice Springs Prison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite apart from the inequities that I have outlined tonight, interestingly, not all property crime in the territory is subject to these mandatory sentencing laws. Curiously, shoplifting, which is often termed a middle-class crime, is exempt, as are a range of white&hyphen;collar crimes such as embezzlement and fraud. The territory suffers from a very high incidence of assault and sexual assault. In 1996 the incidence of assault in the territory was more than twice the national average, while the incidence of sexual assault was nearly twice the national average. Neither offence is subject to mandatory sentencing. It begs the question: is property more important than people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory government has so far completely ignored criticisms from magistrates, including the Northern Territory's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> chief magistrate, and lawyers about the inherent inequities of these laws. However, I would hope that at some stage in the near future the government will review whether these laws have had any measurable effect on the property crime rate. The government must balance the community good against what are already individual cases of gross injustice. At that point, it should seriously consider wiping the slate clean and repealing this obnoxious legislation.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8268"><TITLE>Film Censorship</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Anyone who picked up today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  to read the grim news that in the past 11 months six young women and teenage girls have been kidnapped or murdered or have disappeared along the New South Wales coastal highway would feel grief for the families and grave concern for society. There have been other like tragedies over the years and of late&mdash;for example, the missing 11&hyphen;year&hyphen;old boy from Western Australia&mdash;that make us think just how unsafe society has become.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our concern is not just restricted to Australia. Who can forget the pictures that ricocheted around the world of the Belgium `house of horrors' where a paedophile ring was involved in the kidnapping, torture and murder of children as young as eight years old? At each tragedy a family suffers and a society is damaged. At each tragedy society fundamentally changes for the worse as once enjoyed freedoms are taken away, none less than life itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, if we were asked, `Is there something society can do to help rectify these seemingly irreversible changes?' we would answer yes. If we were told that there was a movie currently showing that graphically displays a story of kidnap, sexual abuse, torture and murder of adolescents in the style of the above incidents I have mentioned&mdash;indeed, a movie described as a handbook for the Mr Cruels of this world&mdash;would you believe that it should be banned? The answer from society would be yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I therefore bring to the Senate's attention the movie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS>, which is currently under 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8269"> review by the Film and Literature Board of Review. The review has been prompted by an application by the Queensland government to re&hyphen;ban the movie. The movie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo </EMPHASIS>was made in 1976 and banned in this country for some 17 years but was released into the mainstream theatres in 1993. The storyline begins with the kidnap of 16 adolescents in an Italian village, eight of each sex. For the remainder of the film, they are subjected to every form of violence, sexual humiliation and torture before being mass slaughtered in a most bizarre fashion. The movie has been condemned outright by every film critic of any note, being described as vile and a treat for sadists and psychopaths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make reference to the hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies in Sydney on Thursday, 5 August 1993 to try to encapsulate the depths and darkness of the movie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS>. The committee transcript reads that the movie:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contains constant nudity, masturbation, forced sodomy, forced urolagnia, coprophagous, humiliation and degradation, anilingus, suicide, candlewax burns to breasts and male genitalia, a man's tongue cut off, an eye explicitly gouged out with a knife, a woman partially scalped, a boy's nipples branded with a hot iron, being forced to eat excreta, torture and killing during the "Cycle of Blood" canto. Naked male and female youths forced to behave as animals going on all fours to beg for food&mdash;eventually betraying their fellows in an attempt to survive, hanging, whipping, accompanied by raconteurs' stories based on offensive, fetishes and paedophilia, a woman's verbal accounts of sex experiences as a child and of matricide . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And there is much, much worse. Other descriptions are so graphic that I am prevented from citing them to the Senate. It is legitimate then to ask: according to whom and under what criteria was the movie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS>  released into Australian society? In essence, the movie was released in 1993. The words of the Chairman of the then Film and Literature Review Board were that `adults in a free society ought to be allowed to see whatever they like'. He also said the movie has artistic merit even though the same chairman stated that the adolescents suffer sexual torment and sadistic humiliation of the extreme kind.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thankfully it is a very different Film and Literature Review Board in 1997 from what it was in 1993 when the ban was lifted on the movie. In fact, the board is in transition, with three new members soon to be appointed. The pending decision before the new review board will be to either redraw the line in the sand on censorship or continue to ride the pendulum of censorship towards the outer limits. I am sure that if the board were to use the community as their touchstone on this issue the movie would surely be re&hyphen;banned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The time has come to say the censorship decisions in this country should not be underpinned by the motto `adults should be free to see whatever they like without regard to the cost to society'. For that matter, the time has come to bury that other reason the movie was released&mdash;artistic merit. This so often used catch phrase to release movies like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS> is an indulgent, sectional and narcissistic view and hurts the general good of society. Both tenets of faith are now discredited, particularly given the belief and evidence that a diet of violent and sexually abusive videos and movies will trigger the disturbed mind. Both tenets can no longer underpin our censorship philosophy to the exclusion of protecting a decent and accepted social standard. Therefore, each member of the Film and Literature Board of Review should vote to re&hyphen;ban <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8269"><TITLE>Uranium Mining</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last couple of days we have seen focus again on the important issues of the future of uranium mining in the Northern Territory. There have been two motions dealt with by this Senate, one late last week by Senator Bob Brown and another today by Senator Meg Lees. It is very interesting to note the importance of these issues. Naturally, both of those motions, coming from the green left field, certainly would be predictable as to what people are expecting from people in either the Greens or the Democrats and the position that they have historically taken and played with regard to the possibility of uranium mining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say from the side of politics where I stand that I totally support the open 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8270"> ing up of further uranium mines because I honestly believe that the environmental and Aboriginal considerations that seem to preoccupy so many people on the left have been well and truly dealt with and adequately controlled. Certainly, there is a commitment to making sure that the safeguards are properly in place and will be there for future generations and for the future economic development of the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to look over the record on this issue of my Senate colleague from the Northern Territory, Senator Bob Collins. He has had a stance and a position that is well known and goes right back to 1986 at a famous Labor Party conference in Hobart where he took a position. Almost yearly since then he has made no secret of his support for more uranium mining as long as the price is right. Like me, he has often expressed concern about Aboriginal issues or environmental issues and how they stack up. It is also important to track the sort of record that Senator Collins has set. Let me put a couple of his comments back down. In 1992 Senator Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There's no secret about my position of support for the industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's whether those two mines should proceed irrespective of what the mineral is that they're producing and as I say particularly in the case of Jabiluka, not so much in the case of Koongarra which is a much smaller mine with a much shorter lifespan I mean it's a Nabarlek type deposit and I think frankly that Nabarlek demonstrated very well how you can engineer a mine and then restore the area very well afterwards with very little damage to the area, but in the case of Jabiluka you're talking about potentially a huge mine in the middle of and you would know that if you travel to the area as frequently as I do, in the middle of probably the most travelled tourist route in Kakadu; that is, the road from the Arnhem Highway to the East Alligator River crossing and the mine has got a life of 40 or 50 years depending on how much product you take out of it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is interesting to track this chronology. In December 1993 Senator Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proximity of the two major deposits at Jabiluka and Koongarra to the Kakadu National Park will be I think the central issue in the debate. The fact that they are legally excised from the park, and always were, by the Fraser government when the park was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> created, they are located within Kakadu National Park and I think that will be the major focus for the debate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In 1994 Senator Collins suggested a compromise which would allow two new mines in the Alligator River region of the Northern Territory but effectively cut out CRA's uranium leases in Western Australia. In the 1994 debate Senator Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish it worked like that in the market place and of course it doesn't no matter what commodity you're talking about. Each particular company has got its own contracts, its own connections around the world, its own arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">More recently, in September 1995, Senator Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While there is a legitimate and peaceful&hyphen;purpose market for our uranium, then we should continue to be in the marketplace, and if the market indicates potential to open new mines, I believe there is a case for relaxing the three mines policy. But let me also make it clear&mdash;I am utterly opposed to what the French are doing in the Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">More recently, in February 1996, Senator Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional mines would of course benefit the Territory economy, but the numbers people within the Labor Party have it right on this one.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Bringing that up to date in 1997, it is very important to look at the positions Senator Collins has taken in the voting. Last week, on the motion by Senator Bob Brown, Senator Collins sided with the Labor Party factional vote. Importantly, the final point of that motion called on the government to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . proceed no further with the Jabiluka uranium proposal.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Where did Senator Collins vote? He voted along with the ayes on that motion and they were carried 34&hyphen;33. Shame on Senator Collins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then today, as I drew to your attention, Madam President, during the course of the debate on Senator Meg Lees's motion relating to Koongarra, Senator Collins was conspicuously absent from this chamber for the vote. He had sought a pair, as Senator Faulkner indicated in his interjection to me across the chamber&mdash;I think he used the words, `He's got a pair, you fool,' referring to me. I find that inexcusable when Senator Lees's motion set out to call on the government to now state 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8271"> clearly that it will not proclaim section 3 of the Koongarra Project Area Act 1981.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Senator Collins absented himself today. You can look back at the number of quotes and the issues of support he has given but he has now chosen, in an unfortunate way, a spineless absence from the Senate chamber.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Thursday evening on a radio interview in Darwin the ABC reporter specifically asked about the then Bob Brown motion. He asked the question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . you are expected to vote on party lines, but you do have the option to abstain from voting and seeking a pairing . . . don't you?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">To which Senator Collins replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If I had been politically stupid enough to have done that, I would have given Bob Brown's silly anti uranium motion national publicity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What has he done today? He has done exactly that to the `silly' Koongarra motion of today. Senator Collins has indicated that he has one standard&mdash;two bob each way, if you like&mdash;when he is acting on these important territory issues. He failed to vote with the Labor Party today on this important issue. He seems to have different arguments, different excuses each day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government members defeated that motion today. The Koongarra proposal is very important because that proposed agreement contains important benefits for traditional owners and the Aboriginal community, particularly in the areas of education and social advantages, if and when the mining project proceeds. It is peculiar and hypocritical in the extreme that Senator Collins has taken the action he did today.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) I am aware that on 18 June 1997 the Mirrar Gundjehmi wrote to the World Heritage Bureau, which is the Executive of the World Heritage Committee, regarding this matter. I am currently not aware of whether the Australian Conservation Foundation has written in similar terms to the World Heritage Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) No decision has been made by the World Heritage Committee to include Kakadu National Park in the List of World Heritage in Danger. In my view, there is no basis for suggesting that the Park be included on this list and there is no threat to Australia's international reputation. Australia will be reporting to the Committee that given the stringent processes in place to address any possible impacts on the World Heritage values of the Park, it does not consider that the values are under threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) I consider that the thorough way in which environmental assessment of the Jabiluka proposal was undertaken will in no way diminish Australia's international reputation. I do not believe that the Jabiluka mine will have an impact on Australia as a tourist destination given that there is no evidence of which I am aware to suggest that the Ranger uranium mine, which has been operating for some time within the same region, has had any impact on levels of tourist visitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I advised the Minister for Resources and Energy, in correspondence of 22 August 1997, that on the evidence available there appears to be no environmental issue which should prevent the proposed Jabiluka mine from proceeding provided the project is subject to stringent conditions relating to the biophysical, cultural and social significance of the environment associated with the mine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In developing my recommendations to the Minister I was particularly mindful of Australia's

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Australia's 1991 nomination of Kakadu National Park to the World Heritage List stated on page 84 that: `The cultural sites of Kakadu National Park exhibit six attributes that place them among the greatest bodies of sites in the world:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) The Report of the Sixteenth session of the World Heritage Committee (held December 1992) which considered the 1991 renomination of Kakadu National Park, commended the Australian authorities `for concluding a 10-year program to extend this park and for the exemplary management operation at the Park'. The Government remains committed to the management of Kakadu in a manner that protects all aspects of its World Heritage values, including the `living cultural tradition that continues today'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recently sponsored, jointly with the Northern Territory Government and Energy Resources of Australia, a comprehensive and independent study of the social impact of development on Aboriginal communities in the Kakadu region. The study produced a Community Action Plan to both mitigate impacts and to realise the opportunities that Kakadu represents for reflecting the meaning of a reconciled Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The joint management arrangement for Kakadu National Park, between the Commonwealth the park's traditional owners, is one of the success stories for reconciliation. Joint management and the protection of Kakadu's World Heritage values will be further developed in the life of the next Kakadu National Park Plan of Management, which I am currently considering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) As I have indicated in my answer to Question 6, Kakadu National Park is inscribed on the World Heritage List for natural criteria (ii), (iii) and (iv). Each of these criteria is addressed in turn:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Criterion (ii) Outstanding examples representing significant ongoing geological processes, biological evolution and man's interaction with his natural environment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ongoing geological processes;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The area encompassed by the Kakadu National Park has experienced considerable change during a relatively short geological period. Extensive mangrove swamps developed about 6500 years ago, at the time the sea reached its current level. Over the next 1000 years, increasing sedimentation effectively choked the mangroves, resulting in the formation of flood plains and tidal river channels. The Magela flood plain developed as recently as 1300 years ago. These processes were driven predominantly by sea-level changes. Geological processes continue today, with the coast of the park growing at the relatively fast rate of 20- 30 centimetres per year. The effects on these geological processes caused by the tailings repositories, which 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cover approximately 0.005% of the area of Kakadu National Park, will be negligible over all time scales.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Biological evolution;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless it is demonstrated to the Supervising Scientist that an alternative design of tailings repository is at least as protective of the environment, all tailings will be returned to mine pits. The inherent stability of a pit renders the risk of a catastrophic failure of the tailings repository negligible. Thus the credible pathways for transport of contaminants to the biosphere are via groundwater and erosion. Measures will be taken to reduce groundwater contamination to inconsequential levels by sealing aquifers that intersect the pits and possibly by the use of a permeable envelope which will divert groundwater flow around the tailings in the event of seals failing. Both techniques will be subject to ongoing research and development to tailor them to the site specific requirements of the Ranger lease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minimisation of contaminant transport via erosion will be achieved by the capping design for the tailings repositories. The capping over the tailings in the pits will have a design life of at least 200 years and a structural life of at least 1000 years. This means that the capping will perform its required function without maintenance or renovation for at least 200 years, and will continue to perform its basic function, albeit at a reduced level of efficiency, for at least 1000 years. These criteria ensure that there will be no effect on the Kakadu ecosystem within the first 200 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tailings will effectively replace the uranium ore which was present in the pits prior to mining. After 200 years, there may be a gradual release of radioactive material in a manner similar to the natural processes which affected the undisturbed uranium ore prior to mining. The effective half life of tailings is less than 0.002% (or one-fifty thousandth) of uranium ore, resulting in a much reduced radiological burden in the very long term. Between 200 years and several tens of thousands of years after mine decommissioning, the envisaged release of radioactive materials from the tailings repository will be similar to that which would have occurred if the ore had not been mined. After this period, the much shorter half life of the tailings when compared to uranium ore (77,000 years compared with 4.5 billion years) is likely to result in a release rate less than that which would have occurred if the ore had not been mined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ecosystem of the Kakadu region has evolved over the millennia in an environment with enhanced radiation levels. The uranium tailings are not expected to alter the biological evolution of the Kakadu ecosystem in the short or long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Man's interaction with the natural environment 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8278">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tailings repositories will have no impact on sacred sites or rock art, and will be designed and constructed in a manner such that Aboriginal people may safely undertake traditional activities in the area. Access to the tailings repositories is likely to be restricted for a period of several years after decommissioning to allow for continued monitoring and assessment. However, after this initial period, it is likely that the area will be incorporated within the Kakadu National Park. Aboriginal people will then be free to access the area in an identical manner to any other part of the park, and the impact of the tailings on man's interaction with the natural environment will be nil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Criterion (iii) Unique, rare or superlative natural phenomena, formations or features or areas of exceptional natural beauty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tailings repositories will have no impact on the escarpment or other outstanding geological formations of Kakadu. Nor, as discussed in relation to Criterion (ii), will the tailings damage the ecosystems of the flood plains or eucalypt forests. The entire mine site, including the tailings repositories will be landscaped and revegetated with native species, returning it to a state congruous with the pre-mining environment. In less than 50 years, the mine site is likely to be indistinguishable in most respects from the surrounding areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Criterion (iv) The most important and significant habitats where threatened species of plants and animals of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science and conservation still survive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As discussed in relation to Criterion (ii), the tailings will not impact upon the surrounding ecosystem for at least the first 200 years after mine decommissioning. Sometime later than 200 years post mine decommissioning, there may be a slow release of radioactive material into the environment mirroring that which would have occurred if the ore had not been mined. This release is not expected to have any significant deleterious effects on the local habitats. In the very long term, the noticeably shorter effective half life of tailings compared to uranium ore will result in a significantly lower radiological burden to the local habitat.</PARA>

Consequently, the following answers do not include data concerning interception or listening device warrants issued to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 that permit the National Crime Authority (NCA) and a declared `eligible authority' of a State to apply for an interception warrant did not come into operation until 1 September 1988. Those amendments also significantly extended the classes of offences for which warrants may be issued. Before that date, an interception warrant for law enforcement purposes could be sought only by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) for the investigation of narcotic offences punishable as provided by section 235 of the Customs Act 1901. Consequently, statistics on interception warrants issued to law enforcement agencies during the year 1987/88 are not included in the reply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A report concerning telephone interception warrants issued to law enforcement agencies during the year 1996/97 is currently being prepared. The report will be tabled in Parliament in accordance with section 104 of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 does not specify the nature of a device that may be used under a warrant. A warrant authorises the agency to which it is issued to intercept communications made to or from a service. Intercepting a communication means listening to or recording, by any means, that communication in its passage over a telecommunications system without the knowledge of the person making the communication (subsection 6(1)).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) Part III warrants</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney-General, on receipt of a request by the Director-General of Security, may issue a warrant allowing ASIO to intercept telecommunications to obtain intelligence relating to security (section 9) or to obtain foreign intelligence (section 11A). In addition, the Director-General of Security may issue a warrant in emergencies and for a short term (section 10).</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only certain judges, referred to in the Act as `eligible Judges', may issue warrants authorising interceptions for law enforcement purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In deciding whether to issue a warrant, the Judge must be satisfied about certain matters set out in section 45 (class 1 offences) or section 46 (class 2 offences). The principal matters which the Judge is required to consider are: the availability of alternative methods of investigating the offence; and, in the case of class 2 offences, the gravity of the conduct being investigated and the degree of interference with the privacy of any person. Class 1 and class 2 offences are defined in subsection 5(1) and section 5D respectively.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASIO Act permits the Attorney-General, upon receipt of a request by the Director-General of Security, to issue a warrant authorising ASIO to use a listening device in relation to a particular person to obtain intelligence relevant to security (section 26). The Attorney-General must be satisfied, among other things, that that person is engaged in, or is reasonably suspected by the Director-General of Security of being engaged in, or being likely to engage in, activities prejudicial to security. There is provision for the Director-General of Security to issue a warrant in emergencies (section 29).</PARA>
