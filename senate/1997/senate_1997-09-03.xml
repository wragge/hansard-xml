<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the conclusion of yesterday's consideration of this item in the committee stage there was a proposal by the opposition senators to basically accept a list of policy guidelines. There were some proposals by the Democrats to alter them and this proposal, which I foreshadowed, was to include the key items of the opposition's proposals and the important matters contained within the bill&mdash;the old 8(a) and (c). The item under contention from the opposition's point of view was item (c). They said that they could not live with keeping the current clause in the Productivity Commission Bill. The new (b) in my proposal is specifically to reduce regulation of industry, including regulation by the states, territories and local government. That was their major bugbear, even though it was in the Labor Party's 1990 Industry Commission Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also included concerns raised by the Greens and the Democrats. So it is a compendium that seeks to create a consensus. I will move that amendment formally. Procedurally, if this amendment is passed it would make redundant Senator Sherry's proposed amendment. It already includes the amendment of the Democrats and the proposal of the Greens so it would probably make any further amendments unnecessary. I am formally foreshadowing that I intend to move my amendment.  </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission must have regard to the desire of the Commonwealth Government:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Ours is differently worded in that it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the performance of its functions, the Commission must give priority to:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So ours is more clearly an instruction on policy guidelines to the commission rather than having regard to the desire of the Commonwealth government, and we see that as important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's new paragraph (b) reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to reduce regulation of industry (including regulation by the States, Territories and local government) where this is consistent with the social and economic goals of the Commonwealth Government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would just reiterate that we see that it is undesirable for that to continue to be a policy guideline for the commission, for the reasons I outlined yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, to some extent the old powers of the Industry Commission were superseded by the National Competition Council in its role, and it is carrying out that role adequately. Secondly, given the greatly enhanced functions of the Productivity Commission that this Senate has approved, we do not believe that, as a subsidiary objective of those functions, it is desirable for that proposed government paragraph (b) to continue. They are the reasons why we will be putting our amendment rather than supporting the government's compromise amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a new item in the debate. Yesterday, the opposition said that they were not going to support this because we had retained the old 8(c) from the Industry Com 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6241"> mission Act&mdash;an act of the former Labor government. Now they are saying that they will not accept it because we are again adopting the wording from the Industry Commission Act of the Labor government in the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What they ask this Senate to do is to give an inane and stupid direction to the new Productivity Commission. It is a quite silly thing to do. If you said to a four&hyphen;year&hyphen;old child, `I want you to give priority to this&mdash;I want you to go and clean up your toys,' you might be lucky and your four&hyphen; or five&hyphen;year&hyphen;old will go and clean up his toys. But if you say to your four&hyphen; or five&hyphen;year&hyphen;old, `I want you to give priority to cleaning up your toys, going out and cleaning up the garden, tidying up your room, helping mum do the dishes' and three other things at once, your four&hyphen; or five&hyphen;year&hyphen;old would probably get confused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What these people on the other side would say is, `Look, we had it all wrong in 1990 when we created the Industry Commission Act. We shouldn't have regard to the desire of the Commonwealth to do these important things. You've got to give priority to all seven of them, regardless of whether there is some conflict between each one of those seven.' What you are really saying is, `Let's not be serious about it at all. Let's just destroy the meaning of the whole thing.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite sensible, as the previous government's Industry Commission Act said, to have regard to the desirability of doing these things. To say that you have got to give priority to seven things is just plain stupid, inane, and probably typical of the Australian Labor Party's general performance on economic matters since they came into government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry did not come in here in his six years in government and say, `We can't live with this. We are going to have to amend this. The government is going to amend its Industry Commission Act because the Industry Commission doesn't work because it can only give regard to the desire of the government to do these things.' He did not do that. He was the parliamentary secretary for a few years. He was in an important position. He did not come in and amend the Industry Commission Act. But now he is saying, `We 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> won't accept this because it's not good enough.' The hypocrisy is absolutely overwhelming, Senator Sherry. You should be ashamed of yourself, and so should your government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not good enough to say, `We are going to live and die by this amendment because you will not give priority to this instead of having a sensible clause,' as was in your own act&mdash;the previous government's act. The Australian Labor Party is becoming a sad joke on economic matters; it really is. It has no credibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to you, Madam Chair, that the wording in the proposal sought in a very genuine way to create a consensus on this issue. It pulled in the concerns of the Democrats and the Greens and accommodated all of Senator Sherry's proposals. He just keeps coming up with these little reasons why he wants to oppose it. It is churlish. It is childish. It is a dog in the manger sort of attitude. Senator Sherry, reconsider your position and get serious on this. If you were really serious, you would have changed your Industry Commission Act any time in the last six years when you were in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just stupid to give priority to seven different things that can often be conflicting. I am sure that Senator Harradine and Senator Murray will not play your game. They are not people who are stupid or inane. I hope that they will see the genuineness of my proposal and will support it. I urge you to do so.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Campbell obviously got out of bed on the wrong side this morning. Maybe he needs a cigarette; I should oblige him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reasons I have advanced this morning as to our concern with the government's proposal are entirely consistent with the reasons I advanced yesterday. Senator Campbell, we do take this legislation seriously, because we take the current economic problems facing Australia very seriously. I think even you would agree that we have a new range of circumstances in economic policy because we have a new government with a new set of priorities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6242">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have in front of us a new Productivity Commission Bill which attempts, unfortunately, to combine all of the features of the three organisations it seeks to replace. I submit to the Senate that I do not think that it is inane or stupid to insist, as Labor has done, that the policy guidelines for the new commission should include growth in employment in regional areas, promotion of regional development, Australia's international obligations and progress made by Australia's trading partners in reducing both tariff and non&hyphen;tariff barriers. I do not think that that is an inane or stupid approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had some comment about the National Party's role, or lack of it, in this debate yesterday. I do not think Senator Boswell would regard our insistence on priorities such as growth and employment, including that of regional areas, and the promotion of regional development as inane or stupid. I look forward to Senator Boswell voting for our amendment in this regard, because I know how important the National Party rates issues in respect of regional areas and the promotion of regional development. I look forward to his contribution and support in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said yesterday, I pay tribute to Senator Boswell and his party as being the last true socialist party in this country. I think that is something we should recognise and get clearly on the record. I hope Senator Boswell will participate in this debate. I am pleased he is here this morning to follow this debate very closely, to expose the way in which Senator Campbell and the government are attempting to hoodwink the National Party. I know on many occasions Senator Boswell has stood up for regional Australia. I hope he recognises that in his contribution to this debate on the Productivity Commission.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Campbell, I thought your remarks to Senator Sherry were a little intemperate. For my part&mdash;and I have had some very long debates with him&mdash;I have not ever found him stupid or inane. Sometimes he can be difficult and determined, but stupid and inane are not the words I would have used to describe him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the permission of the chair, I think we need to debate both suggestions concurrently because they are alternates. Senator Campbell, I would indicate to you that it is our belief that you have gone a very long way to reaching the requests of the four parties that have put a view on this matter before the Senate. My one determination would be that you would look at your first line and take out `desire of the Commonwealth Government' and replace it with the word `need'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Sherry has made the right comment, as have other participants in the debate, that as far as possible the Productivity Commission should be giving independent advice and should not be seen to be unnecessarily subservient to the wishes of the government of the day. Obviously they have to take into consideration their opinions, but most of all they have to have regard to the needs of the entire economy as well as the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Senator Campbell is happy to accept that change, we would then be happy to swing behind his amendment. We would request that Senator Sherry looks to amend his amendment if there are further words that he believes are desirable. We would certainly accept it as he has put it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition is happy to accept that suggestion for change. I will amend my foreshadowed motion to delete the word `desire of the Commonwealth Government' and replace it with the word `need'. I think that is a sensible suggestion, Senator Murray. In my example of trying to give priority to seven things, when you prioritise things, you generally create a list of importance. We do that for legislation. We decide what is the priority legislation for the week or the month or the year. When we prioritise tasks in our private lives we do that. Necessarily, one comes on top and others come down the bottom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our lives and in our public policy we also look at needs, and needs can compete. I think priorities also compete, but ultimately you have to give something priority. You could suggest that regional development comes second last, as it did under Labor's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6243"> proposal in terms of priority. We do not necessarily think you should do that. You should look at all of the competing needs and make rational, sensible judgments on those needs. Needs can compete, and that is a sensible suggestion which the government will support. I hope other senators will support it. You can have competing needs, but to give priority to seven different things is silly. It cannot be done. We will support this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Boswell, the coalition's proposal explicitly talks about regional needs, regional employment and the promotion of regional development. I think Senator Sherry might have been mischievously seeking to mislead our coalition partners.</PARA>

It has here `to recognise the progress made by Australia's trading partners in reducing both tariff and non-tariff barriers'. But I cannot see anything there about Australia's international obligations. There are a whole range of obligations that Australia does have which go not only to human rights questions but also to the very issues of trading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must be aware and conscious of the fact that in many ways we do have obligations to the less developed countries, and we must be conscious of those obligations. Obviously, we do not want to get into a situation in this whole trading area which would be similar to that which occurred before the last war, for example, where the developed world put huge barriers up against trade from other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as priority here is given to developing our own industries, and so on, you have to strike a balance. But we do have to have regard, I believe, to our obligations internationally, and I agree with what Senator Margetts has said.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators would recall the publicity surrounding the car tariffs decision, when three models came into the debate and contributed very well to a far more reasonable appraisal of the alternatives which faced the government in its decision making and, in our belief, assisted the government to come to a decision which was helpful to that industry. The Industry Commission, in our view, has not been notorious for being open to new ideas or alternative theories or to any viewpoint that does not fit with its particular ideology. The ORANI model has, time and again, been found to be biased towards supporting its ideological positions. We feel it has become a weapon rather than a tool.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think your argument is weakened, Parliamentary Secretary, by the fact that you are now reverting to one source of advice to the government. You no longer have a variety of sources. This is a consolidated commission and, apart from external sources of advice, it will provide the prime source of information and calculation for government opinions on various industry matters. It is because there are not going to be competing models available from competing agencies within government that we think we should make it mandatory that, where you use a modelling process, you use at least two models.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should remind the Senate of the importance of models in the car debate and, frankly, presently in the greenhouse debate. In the car debate it was claimed that, according to those models, savings ranging from in excess of $2,000 to $80 per vehicle would result. Until such time as the alternative private sector models were made available, consumers were 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6249"> led up the garden path of believing that the ORANI version would result in these huge benefits to consumers, whereas other models regarded that approach as just a myth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because very few ministers or departments have the time or the energy or the experience to evaluate mathematical models at length, the government does need alternative modelling available. So what would otherwise normally be a sensible suggestion to give you some flexibility I think in this case would gut the intention of our amendment, which is to require the commission to deliberately and actively consult alternative models.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary secretary says it will be difficult for the commission to have access to alternative models. I think&mdash;and I do not mean this in any unkind way&mdash;the government's inexperience shows in that the process of constructing models is quite widely available and used by professional commercial houses, by universities and indeed by the Industry Commission.

As the parliamentary secretary said, for economic modelling it should be applied where practical. I have no real problem with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, the clear intention of the parliament is expressed by the bulk of this amendment. The parliamentary secretary has explained to the committee that he foresees some need to insert `wherever practical' for particular circumstances.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to put a viewpoint based on a heretical standpoint in relation to economic modelling. My standpoint comes from studying most of my economics at the University of East Anglia. The advisers seem to think that is funny. The University of East Anglia looked at economics from the viewpoint that it is not a science&mdash;and it is not. It is not even a social science. It is actually a theoretical construct, and it actually also is very much based on what philosophical viewpoint you come from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of development studies, economics could be looked at from a variety of different viewpoints depending on where you start in your assumption. You could actually have, and we did have, an economics text which was written in three columns which looked at three different theories of economics. Every issue that is brought up with an economic theory can be looked at depending on what your basic assumption is&mdash;what the causal factor is and what the outcome is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you assume that there is only one model, you are actually saying that economics is some sort of science. As far as I am concerned, it is a science only in terms of the science of alchemy. You can have the old 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6250"> story about light bulbs and economists. You have as many theories, in reality, as you have economists&mdash;and sometimes more. The reality is we cannot put into legislation some assumption that there is one theory and one way and that somehow or other economics is a mathematical science. It is not. There are some ways of describing what we know. There are never ways of proving what we know within economics. It is not that kind of study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think if we assume that there ever can be a situation where there is only one way of modelling, it is the assumption that classical economics is the only way of looking at things. A number of years ago I was talking to a lecturer in economics at the University of Western Australia. I said, `Look, it is extraordinary to me that those people who have never been out of the system teach Keynesian economics as if it is a branch of classical economics.' This chap never had been out of the system. He looked at me and said, `It is, isn't it?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what we are suggesting here today: that somehow or other, economics is something that can tell us what to do; that it is some sort of science that can be put into a mathematical formula and that there is a right formula&mdash;that there can be a right formula that applies to a particular situation. I would firmly and vociferously say that it is always a theoretical construct and your assumptions will differ depending on which angle you take it from. On the cost of production, do you take classical economics, Marxist or Keynesian economics? Depending on which angle you come from, the causes and outcomes will differ; and to assume anything else is alchemy.</PARA></SPEECH>

So I generally agree 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with her on that. I might be able to classify myself as an East Anglian school economist; one thing I never want to be called is an economist. In relation to Senator Murray's amendment, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Omit "must utilise", substitute "must wherever practicable utilise".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Speaking to that amendment to Senator Murray's amendment, I profess not to be a great expert on all the different economic models and how they are made, Senator Murray, but I do have a broad concept of what makes up an economic model. I agree that there are a whole range of different economic models available from private sector economic organisations&mdash;which I have referred to a number of times over the last couple of days&mdash;and from universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it was the Monash model that was used for the car industry inquiry. The point is that there is a range of advice available to the government now from the emerging range of private sector economic organisations and from universities. To say that this is consolidating all the government's advice ignores the fact that EPAC had been run down under the previous government to a staff of about 10. It also ignores the fact that BIE was never a statutory organisation. It was not an independent organisation; it was a division under the industry portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ignores the fact that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) and the government can create&mdash;and do create&mdash;their own economic advice within the industry department. It may not have its own letterhead or its own quasi&hyphen;organisation, but it can create that advice&mdash;and I am sure that that occurs on a daily basis. It ignores the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his department can get advice, from any of those places that you identified or from within their own departmental sources, to challenge the Productivity Commission or to challenge the view of Treasury. That is a natural, healthy debate that occurs within the hallowed walls of government on a daily basis, particularly on matters such as the car industry and the TCF matters that will be before the government shortly.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6251">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To focus on the question that you ask, `What is a practical example?' there will be an off&hyphen;the&hyphen;shelf model that is most appropriate in considering a particular inquiry. In relation to the car inquiry it was regarded by the commission that the Monash one was the best. Others would say that there are other models that may have been more appropriate, but there will be specific inquiries where a model that is available will be the most appropriate model to use. To be forced legislatively to go out to a university or another private sector organisation and say, `Under clause 8(3) of this new Productivity Commission Bill  we have to have two models is not practical; can you develop us a model or can we buy some other model even though, because of the equations contained in it, it is not particularly suitable to that inquiry, be it on a forest, TCF, cars, electricity, gas or any other area?' on the face of it, imposes an inefficiency, a requirement for the commission to go off and do something it does not, practically, need to do, particularly when the government has accepted that Senator Murray's proposal that the assumptions in and the results of the model, and the economic modelling relied on in the report, be made explicit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Putting some sunlight on that whole process ensures that we will be able to say, `Was the model that was used any good?' What we are saying is that there will be, and there are, obvious practical examples of where forcing the commission to go out and buy another model from some other supplier or have one created adds expense unnecessarily. So I would ask you to support the sensible requirement that it do so wherever practicable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not weaken the intent of the amendment, Senator Murray. I think it maintains its entire integrity. All it says is that there is a practical recognition of different circumstances. They would be actually breaking the law if, where it was practicable to get another model, they did not do so. If what you say is correct&mdash;and I have no doubt that it is&mdash;it will be practicable in many circumstances. I do not think it weakens the integrity of your amendment; and I urge support for my proposal to amend that amendment.</PARA>

We were particularly surprised that this new function was included with respect to the Productivity Commission. We do not believe that this has anything to do with what is essentially an academic research body. There is already a specialist Commonwealth regulator, the ACCC, which is obviously the appropriate body to undertake the competitive neutrality investigation function. The ACCC has vast experience in administering competition policy. It is a specialist body in the competition area&mdash;it is not a general research body&mdash;so it should undertake this function, not the Productivity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one respect we are slightly amused by the government's proposal because it would seem to the opposition that it is completely contrary to the type of recommendation that the commission would actually make.

This is a function that should be undertaken, but the commission is clearly not the appropriate body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of clause 10(4), that subclause mandates inclusion in the annual report of details of the competitive neutrality investigation activity of the commission during the year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make the point that, again, this amendment proposed by the opposition does tend to ignore the fact that the Senate yesterday voted under 6(c) that the functions of the commission are, `on and after 1 July 1997, to receive and investigate complaints about the implementation of competitive neutrality arrangements in relation to Commonwealth government businesses and business activities and to report to the minister on its investigations'. These provisions we are now debating&mdash;and we are debating a motion to delete all these provisions which are on pages 14, 15, 16 and 17 of the bill&hyphen; set up the legislative constraints on how the commission would receive and run such inquiries. The Senate has already agreed to give the commission the power to do this, so that debate has been had. These provisions seek to tell the commission how it could go about doing those things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could have a debate about whether setting up a complaints mechanism, which the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6253"> Commonwealth under the previous Labor government agreed it would do with the states, is a good thing. I think most small businesses that have had their businesses ruined by unfair competition from a Commonwealth government business or some other government business would regard this as a very sensible move. I think the previous Labor government saw this as a very important thing to do. So there was bipartisanship on that concept. The Labor Party said that it should go off to the ACCC. We are saying that it is appropriate that it be done here. Either way, the Senate has agreed to give the commission this power. We agreed to that yesterday, I think.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So all this part does is to say, `Now that it has this function, how should it fulfil the function?' This part, if anything, constrains the commission in how it would run the operations. If you were to delete this provision, and I have not taken high-level legal advice on this, I would think that the commission would have this function and it could make up its own mind how it would run the inquiries. With the amount of trust that has been evident around the Senate in the past couple of days about the commission being allowed to do anything it wants, I suspect the Senate would probably want to seek to give it some guidelines and constraints in the law as to how it would conduct those inquiries, and this is just what part 4 does. The same argument that clearly convinced Senator Sherry to withdraw his amendment No. 8, I think it was, applies to this one. We have already given a function to do these inquiries. This part ensures that it does so in a way that is controlled by the provisions in the law.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not forget, Senator Sherry, that competitive neutrality was a Labor invention. It was a Labor invention that destroyed jobs, stripped services, introduced far too much contracting out and introduced unnecessary privatisation. The whole rationale, and it is one of the reasons why we feel so strongly about the Productivity Commission's record, was based on a terribly flawed Industry Commission report&mdash;you remember, the one that promised $25 billion worth of benefits from the competition policy that it laid out. That was the report which, amongst others, Professor John Quiggin found riddled with double counting errors, broad brush assumptions and other errors and inaccuracies. He found that the so-called benefit of $25 billion would be barely one&hyphen;twentieth of that claimed. That is still a lot of money, but was that money worth all the jobs destroyed, the services stripped and all the horror that was caused in our economy? Yet that was the rationale for pursuing current competition policy and the flawed competitive neutrality.

If I can debate it in the context of what is intended by the mover of the motion: as I said, it is part of making the ACCC rather than the Productivity Commission the responsible body for inquiring into competitive neutrality complaints. Senator Murray made the point that it was the previous government's policy to commit itself to the concept of competitive neutrality. Yes, that is true. I am sure it was not the previous government's policy to see that implemented in such a way that would disadvantage many people in the government business enterprise area or the government departmental area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are not going to accept what is in the legislation here, and that is what the amendment is saying, it does not affect the functions of the Productivity Commission. It can do that in any event. Rather than being required to do the things that the parliament is suggesting that it does in the bill, in the division we are talking about, it will simply allow the Treasurer to write off a reference to the commission and sign it off. It might be the lesser of two evils but it is better for us to follow what is contained in the legislation. It at least sets down certain provisions which the commission is obliged to follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of whether competitive controversy matters go to the ACCC as against the Productivity Commission, the latter is an advisory body; the former is the body which pursues firms which may be breaching the law. Competitive neutrality issues do not necessarily mean that the firms are breaching the law. There may be remedies. There may be means of ensuring the principles of competitive neutrality. The effect of this in regard to providing more reasonable services at a cheaper cost to the consumer can probably be solved in a number of ways by the recommendations of the Productivity Commission as distinct from the straitjacket in which the ACCC finds itself.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Suggestions have been made about the competitive neutrality of government business enterprises. That works the other way as well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ought to explain some of the implications of competitive neutrality before we move on. There are a number of examples that I can think of where it is cheaper for the government service provider to continue to provide services that could be provided by the private sector. The desire by the private sector for competitive neutrality means that the advantage that many government service providers have because of their unique situation of being government, which is that there are some costs they do not have to have built in, is lost, and those costs have to be built in. That means that there will be services provided by the private sector which will cost the taxpayer more than they currently paying. The reason is that those advantages that come from those services being provided by the government will not be available any longer or they will become costed into the process and then they are easy to pull out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One example of this is the provision of security training for Commonwealth drivers. It is all very well to have talkback radio people talking about why it should be possible for private sector providers to compete on the same terms but in the meantime the government pulls out its subsidy for security, which means that the training is not necessarily required to be provided. They can put in the tendering document that this is a desirable characteristic but you lose that control. So you get a service which is not the same, but 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6255"> you build in, if you like, a subsidised advantage then to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This ought to be debated. This ought to be put out into the public sector&mdash;that people may get a lesser service, that there will be a reliance on some sort of tendering document to cover all contingencies, that you will get less accountability and that you will move towards what the government seems to be wanting to move to, which is a Public Service which is one&hyphen;tenth of what they came into. Basically you are building into these huge bodies, whether it is the Productivity Commission or the ACCC, the ability to enter a process of eating up the current system without ever considering whether this whole principle, this flawed and, as I call it, monstrous principle of competitive neutrality is valid, never having had the guts to go out to the community and have a full inquiry into the socioeconomic impacts of competition policy, into whether what we are doing is the right thing in terms of outcomes to people in the areas of health, security, education and environment and whether what we are getting is better than what we have. This is a blinkered ideological approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is very dangerous. This is a watershed in Australia's history. It is not just a matter of working out what is better. It is a matter of whether or not we, as taxpayers, are going to be expected to subsidise competitive bidding by private industry which will often mean less services and less accountability.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine raises a good point. In his previous contribution to the debate he said that GBEs could use this complaint mechanism. The provisions which the Labor amendment is seeking, with the support of the Democrats and the Greens it would seem at this stage, to strike out of the bill in fact say that a person may complain to the commission&mdash;I am only paraphrasing&mdash;that a particular Commonwealth business or business activity is not being conducted in accordance with competitive neutrality arrangements. As described in part 3 of the Commonwealth competitive neutrality policy statement of June 1996:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A particular Commonwealth government business or business activity should be required to be conducted in accordance with competitive neutrality arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So those provisions do not allow for a GBE to come to the body. An amendment to include what you are referring to could be put in there if you proposed it. But you would not be able to put it in there if Labor's amendment was supported because they seek to strike out the entire division. We think there are good reasons that such a provision not be included, but if you were to propose an amendment we would be happy to revisit it. But you would not be able to have an amendment if this bit were struck out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your arguments in relation to the role of the ACCC and the Productivity Commission in relation to these complaints are absolutely impeccable. The ACCC investigates these 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6256"> sorts of matters in a very legal way. They come to a conclusion and they usually take injunctive or court action or some other action. The commission will be allowed to look into these matters and give advice to the government as to how the GBE or government activity could be changed to ensure that it was fairer to private firms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that in your experience during your long service in this place, Senator Harradine, you would have received many complaints from small businesses in Tasmania and other parts of the country about unfair competition from Commonwealth government and, I presume, Tasmanian government GBEs and other activities slicing into the market of small businesses in particular. It is certainly my experience. We think it is important that they have a place that they can take a complaint to without having to go to the great big ACCC where the complaint is a very serious matter that could end up in the Federal Court. Quite frankly, small business would be very interested to hear the views of senators who think that this sort of mechanism should not be available to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think a month would have gone by, particularly during my time in opposition, where I did not get some small business complaining to me of some federal government activity. As you know, Senator Harradine, I raised a number of matters in the Senate concerning the engineering divisions of the Commonwealth competing unfairly for projects like Maralinga and the Commonwealth car hire business&mdash;trade union officials getting cars at cheap rates, et cetera. You will remember those things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you sought to put an amendment in we would have an open mind about it because we appreciate your support in principle for having a set of legislative requirements for handling competitive neutrality complaints. The Senate has already agreed that this function should go there so the debate that Senator Margetts is seeking to have is a debate that we have had. I have to respect her views in relation to that, even though they differ from mine. We have had that debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now saying, `Right, now that that power is within the commission, how should 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it be handled?' As you quite properly pointed out, these provisions spell out, in some intricate detail over four pages in the bill, how these complaints can be commenced, the fees that would apply to them, how they would be investigated, how reports are made, how the minister is to respond and so forth. If they are not in there, as you quite properly pointed out, the Treasurer, because the commission has this power, would simply have to provide it with some advice, probably by letter or some other brief as to how to do this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of whether the Senate wants a role in how it fulfils this function, and I think that is desirable, or whether the Treasurer advises the commission how it will fulfil those functions from time to time at his whim. Surely it is desirable, from the parliament's point of view, to say, `This is the way it should be done,' rather than leaving it to the Treasurer to do that from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to those GBEs, we would say that already there are constitutional limitations on what GBEs are allowed to do. There are a range of other matters that apply specifically to government businesses. If government businesses have complaints about their position vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis a private sector competitor in a marketplace, they can already go to their department and their minister to make those complaints, and the minister then makes a decision as to whether that matter can be rectified. They should not need to go off to another quasi&hyphen;government organisation such as the commission to have that dealt with. It should be able to be dealt with within that department that has responsibility for that GBE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are examples that I can recall where that has happened. For example, Comcar have come to the minister&mdash;a series of poor unfortunate souls have been ministers for administrative services over the past 10 years&mdash;and taken complaints up. Where those complaints have not been acted upon, they have come to us and said, `Look, nasty old McMullan'&mdash;or `nasty old Frank Walker'&mdash;`haven't done this.' What I am trying to say in a roundabout way is that there is a mechanism for GBEs to go, within the normal lines of accountability, to their minister and say, for example, `Look, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6257"> we need redress because it is unfair that Hertz Rent A Car are unfairly competing against Dasfleet.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We regard it as unnecessary to have another provision there. But, on the broader point, we do say that it is important that the parliament says, now that the commission has this power and this function, that it be dealt with in a way that is controlled by this legislation in detail over four pages and not dealt with by order of the Treasurer from time to time.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This part of the bill may have to be dedicated to Alan Jones. The debate has been going on in some respects, but in a one&hyphen;sided way in the public arena. That information has been somewhat one&hyphen;sided. It is about whether or not government bodies in service provision like Comcar have a unfair advantage. The outcome was the removal of the security training. The government decided that security training was an unfair disadvantage to the private sector and so took it away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have the functions that government were providing being affected by someone in the private sector who has a whole lot of say out there in the community, when in fact it is a big conflict of interest. It might be useful to ask whether his own drivers have the same level of security training as Comcar drivers were given under that fund. Here we have the private sector insisting that that function, which in the past has been considered important&mdash;that people who drive high profile people should have some sort of ability to act appropriately in times of crisis or in some sort of emergency situation&mdash;be taken away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Someone in the private sector in the media has used the opportunity of bringing that out in debate to the point that that function was taken away as an unfair advantage. That function was taken away because it did not allow the private sector to compete. That is what it is: it is the Alan Jones memorial amendment to this bill. Perhaps we ought to build a little memorial to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing functions in the public sector&mdash;not just this one; this is just an example&mdash;that will actually alter as a result of the private sector saying, `No, we don't think that this is fair, because we would like to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provide it cheaper but we can't do it if we, for instance, have to provide security for a person's information, for their information technology and so on.' They are saying that that is an unfair disadvantage, and the government is saying, `We'll let you compete cheaper. We'll take that away.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what is happening. It is about security. It is about a person's ability to eventually point to where responsibility lies when things go wrong. That is what we are talking about. Competitive neutrality is about eroding those values which do not necessarily have that dollar value or might be subsidised in some way or other in the provision of that service, but there are often very good reasons for that. That is the debate we have never had. Yes, there has been the debate in the public sector. Yes, we know that those people who listen to talkback radio like Alan Jones ring through and we know other industries do that.</PARA>

We know that the 2,000 pieces of legislation are being reviewed. We know that the provision of government services is changing, as we speak, at a very fast rate. Many people are concerned about that. I think at the very least we have an obligation to tease out some of those issues so we can throw out terms like competitive neutrality and act as if it is a principle that has been accepted. I do not believe it has. I believe it is a principle that is very poorly understood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard that the Victorian government would like to see lease cost tendering. This is one step further. Lease cost tendering asks, on the face of it, what the cheapest  provision of service is, but that is still a very debatable concept because it is about whether or not in a tendering document you can include all of those values which would otherwise be provided in the provision of a government service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one step further: it says that basically, if there is a tax advantage, if there are other advantages in infrastructure that already exist within a public department, you have to build those in as if they were costs. That may result in the service being more expensive. It is poorly understood, and I think the strongest argument possible should be made that it is time that the Senate looks at these issues carefully. I agree that we have not looked at those issues fully. I think the community ought to be involved. I think the Senate ought to be supporting a reference to look at those issues carefully and in detail so that we know what we are getting into, so we do not make these stupid mistakes and put these things into legislation without the general public knowing what it is that we are doing.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that were left open ended&mdash;which would be the result of Senator Sherry's amendment being accepted&mdash;it would mean that hopefully a revitalised, renewed, restaffed Industry Commission might say, `Competitive neutrality is not appropriate in this circumstance. Maybe competitive neutrality does not apply in this circumstance.' They would be able to take a far wider, far broader, far more open minded approach to evaluating a complaint than they would under your part 4, division 2. Part 4, division 2, which is prescriptive, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a person may complain to the Commission that:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is not something I would normally say because Senator Murray tends to get things right more times than not, but he is absolutely, totally wrong in relation to this.

It says that a person may complain to the commission that a particular Commonwealth government business activity should be required to be conducted in accordance with competitive neutrality arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this provision, a small business person in Western Australia may make a complaint. A panel beater in Victoria Park who has rung me recently complaining about some unfair activity can complain that a Commonwealth government business activity should be required to be conducted in accordance with these arrangements. It is up to the commission to do some sort of investigation and make a recommendation. It does not force anyone to do anything. It gives a right to a private citizen of Australia, more often than not a small business person or a family business, to make a complaint to an organisation about this activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This provision does not force anyone to do anything. It is totally misleading. The words speak for themselves. A person on or after 1 July 1997 may complain to the commission that a government business is being conducted or should be conducted in accordance with competitive neutrality arrangements, ensuring that they have the right to protect their business from unfair competition from a government business entity. It gives them a right to complain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not force the commission to uphold the complaint. It does not even force the commission to do anything about it, if the commission agrees that it is not a very sen

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, Senator Margetts, because we have put in ecological sustainability and social and environmental aspects, the Senate has required that the commission take all of those things into account. It is misleading to say that we do not consider those matters; we do. The Senate has agreed just today that the commission, in dealing with these matters, take into account regional development, regional employment and ecological sustainability. Again it is misleading to say that competitive neutrality ignores all of these factors. The commission has to take all that into account.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With these competitive neutrality principles, we are faced with the fact that both the government and the alternative government are supporting that principle. I think that `competitive neutrality' is often a myth. But, still, let us deal with the matters in practise. First of all, one of the matters raised by Senator Margetts related to the Commonwealth car service&mdash;a very, very important area. But what is the alternative? What happens now? This is why we parliamentarians feel so helpless about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter now is just dealt with by the minister. There is no public examination of the arguments that might be used by Hertz, or whoever. Under this, the minister who receives complaints from organisations could say, `Well, look, the provisions now are in the legislation. There are provisions there for complaints to be put to the Productivity Commission. You go there and complain and see how you go.' That is, I think, a better way of dealing with it than having a situation whereby, without any public scrutiny, the minister takes decisions, as the minister has taken decisions in respect of that particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was concerned also about 23. We are not actually dealing with that just at the present moment, I suppose, because we are dealing with Senator Sherry's amendment. I looked at the rather prescriptive and narrow provisions 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6261"> in 23(1)(a) and (b). But I assumed that the commission, when looking at these complaints, would have to perform that function in accordance with clause 8(1).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts quite correctly expressed a concern that social and economic impacts may not be able to be considered if the commission proceeds strictly in accordance with section 23 of the bill. The area of concern for a lot of us in this chamber is regional development; for example, the regional structures of some government departments. Is the very fact that, by ministerial direction or by government department policy, those government departments have branches in certain regional areas to be regarded as not being competitively neutral, if a complaint is made by a private firm?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I really need&mdash;and I think Senator Murray has also adverted to it&mdash;is for the parliamentary secretary, on behalf of the government, to make it perfectly plain to us, either by amendment to the proposed section 23 or by a formal statement to the committee when the time comes, that the provisions of 8(1) will be required to be followed by the Productivity Commission in examining complaints under division 2 of this proposed legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In summary, the effect of what the Senate is doing is as follows. We have given the commission the power to conduct inquiries into competitive neutrality issues. We have now agreed that the parliament 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should not legislate how those inquiries be conducted. We have just said to Peter Costello&mdash;or whoever happens to be Treasurer at the time&mdash;that he can write to the commission and say, `This is how you can do it,' whenever he wishes. So the parliament has basically said, `Do it how you like, government. We do not need to scrutinise how you accept these inquiries.' And now the effect of this is to say that, when it conducts these inquiries, it need not even make a report in its annual report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an interesting turn in the Senate's scrutiny of government. We have a Senate that is now saying, `We won't constrain you as to how you conduct the inquiries and we won't constrain you by having you report on it.' I am sure the government can live with this, but we are opposed to it. We think that the commission, when it conducts these inquiries, should make a report. It should report on how it does them and how many it makes.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of our consistent themes is that the Productivity Commission should not be dealing with the issues of competitive neutrality. What remains to be seen is whether it will be dealing with anything. The government should be cognisant of the views of the minor parties and the Labor Party in respect of this concern, and it has not been to date. We will see how it all falls.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it would be entirely inconsistent. Having seen the defeat of the competitive neutrality complaints provisions, we do not believe they should be dealt with by the Productivity Commission. We believe they should be dealt with by the ACCC. When we get to our later amendment, which seeks to ensure that the competitive neutrality complaints are dealt with by the ACCC, the government can make up its mind whether it supports us or not. If it does not, that is the way it will fall, but it will be in the government's court.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary, it would be a pity if the very civilised way in which this debate has been carried out should deteriorate into a bit of bad temper. I would indicate that part 2 was rejected partly on the basis of its being too narrowly confined in terms of how the Productivity Commission should operate and should receive complaints. But the fact is, as you have pointed out many times, 6(1)(c)&mdash;that the commission will investigate complaints&mdash;is on the books. Accordingly, the Australian Democrats have absolutely no objection to the commission reporting on the number of complaints it has. So, although I understand where Senator Sherry is going, I certainly would not stop the commission reporting on that. We will support the existing clause 4.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems that the nature of complaints will probably be a function of the general push in the direction not only of requiring the privatisation of the Public Service but also of requiring that those elements which are left of the public sector find revenue from other sources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there are current sources of complaints, they may often arise from situations like the one that springs to mind&mdash;the proposal by what was the Federal Airports Corporation to put in shopping centres at Perth airport. At the time, the complaint of the community was that, because of the tax advantage which the Federal Airports Corporation then had, they would be proposing to put in some megastores and superstores and to invite, perhaps, overseas investment, and they would have a competitive advantage because of that tax advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That proposal was being pushed by the fact that government business enterprises were being required to turn a dollar. They were not being required to simply provide a service&mdash;in this example, airport services; they were 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> being required to find other sources of funding. Therefore, there was an inevitable consequence that those enterprises were looking for ways to compete with the private sector. That is what they were being told to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the example of the Federal Airports Corporation at Perth airport, it meant that, instead of creating new businesses, they would be taking business from others. Usually in those kinds of instances where you are putting in stores and shops and so on, superstores take business off existing stores. Studies indicated that it would not add to the total economic activity in the area; it would take away from other shopping centres&mdash;which were already suffering badly at the time&mdash;and particularly from the areas around Belmont.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand that, but it is an indication that we are pushing along with this idea that government entities have to compete with the private sector and the private sector has to be able to take business off the government. In the end, those things which the government sector does which are not commercial get virtually taken off the slab or become regarded as unimportant, because the tail wags the dog.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there are going to be complaints, I guess they ought to be made public. While I have generally supported the opposition's amendments, if I read Senator Sherry's body language correctly&mdash;and perhaps it is unfair of me to do that&mdash;I am not sure that he is thoroughly convinced about this amendment either. That is for him to decide for himself. The Greens have always been in favour of scrutiny and, if there is a complaints mechanism, let us see the reports.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with what should be contained in the annual report. I think that this is quite important. I think members of parliament particularly are very concerned that there be in the annual report of particular authorities full and open discussion about how they have performed their functions. We of course have the opportunity to discuss and question those reports, as we do quite frequently, either at the normal sessions of standing committees or at the legislation committees considering the estimates. So I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6264"> think it is important to have full disclosure in those reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without reflecting on the previous vote in any shape or form, might I just point out what the committee has done by having a tied vote on the last occasion. We had a provision in the bill whereby parliament was setting down quite clearly what must be done by the commission when considering complaints on competitive neutrality arrangements. That provision has been, as a result of that tied vote, excised from the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But of course under section 6(1) the commission will still be required to look at these particular matters. The only difference now is that, instead of being required to undertake those investigations in the manner required by parliament, it will be simply by order of the Treasurer. The Treasurer will be able to ask them to proceed in accordance with his viewpoint and his viewpoint alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On reflection, I wonder whether honourable senators realise what we have done in virtually giving the Treasurer a free hand in this matter, unmanacled, if you like, by the provisions which parliament should, in my view, have adopted, which would then have required the commission to follow them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Under clause 28 the appointment of commissioners is to be made by the Governor-General. The opposition supports this method of appointment. We agree there should be a test to be passed before a person can be appointed. At the moment the bill simply provides that the appointee must have qualifications and experience relevant to the commission's functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments propose to include more detail on the relevant experience that the appointee must have. Both our amendment and the revised amendment on sheet 641 outline the types of skills and experience that commissioners have. We believe this will ensure that a proper balance is brought into the commission's considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is saying that the new commission really will be taking on the role of two other bodies in addition to the Industry Commission&mdash;the Bureau of Industry Economics and EPAC. If that is the case, then this shifted emphasis onto industry development and social areas is appropriate. We are surprised that the government did not consider ensuring that the legislation reflect a broader background of appointment, given the amalgam of three organisations and the possible additional powers in respect of complaints about implementation of competitive neutrality arrangements, however that ends up. We 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6265"> have an Industry Commission under a new name, the Productivity Commission, with significantly more functions and power&mdash;and no competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder whether the parliamentary secretary in his response could give an account to the Senate of the staffing changes that have occurred since March 1996. We would be interested to know the number of staff in the former Industry Commission, BIE and EPAC that have been carried through into the new Productivity Commission. We do note&mdash;and it has been referred to earlier in this debate&mdash;that the reorganisation of the three organisations into one has been carried out before parliament approved the organisation. It is of interest to us to know what proportion of staff have been carried over from each respective organisation in their employment by the new Productivity Commission.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Briefly, I do not think we have the detailed questions on the staffing levels at hand, but I am quite happy to supply them in as much detail as possible. I take that on notice, if I may. In relation to this matter of parliamentary approval, the Commonwealth has acted entirely within the bounds of its administrative responsibilities. As I have said a couple of times, the BIE was a division of the department and the Commonwealth can, under normal departmental arrangements, decide from time to time how to structure its departments, without reference to the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the main issue under debate with this amendment, Senator Sherry said something along the lines that he wonders why, with the amalgamation of the three former bodies, we did not allow a broader range of commissioners. I think it is obvious from reading clause 2 that it really ensures that the broadest possible range of commissioners can be appointed. You are allowed, I think, somewhere between four and 11 commissioners and clause 28(2) says that the Governor&hyphen;General can make appointments based on qualifications and experience relevant to the commission's functions. We have had a long debate about the functions and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> also about the policy guidelines, and you could not really get a lot broader than that. It does not fetter it in any way and, in fact, the amendment proposed by the opposition and a similar set of words proposed by the Democrats do tend to fetter it in some ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of the commission, I am advised, is very much that the government has always considered skills and experience which are necessary when it makes such appointments. The areas that are raised by this amendment look at environment, social matters and industry. I think it is worth noting, for example, that in relation to the environmental, waste management, equipment and systems inquiry the government appointed Dr Tor Hundloe as a commissioner for that inquiry. Dr Hundloe's background is as a lecturer in the School of Australian Environmental Studies at Griffith University and planning officer to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. That is an example of a commissioner who has been appointed because of his skills and experience in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the charitable organisations inquiry, Sister Margaret McGovern AO was appointed. Sister McGovern had previously served on the board of the Mater Hospital, the Australian National Council on AIDS, the St Vincent de Paul inner city homelessness programs, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, and numerous other projects involving refugee camps, the aged and Aboriginal people. Another example in relation to the TCF inquiry currently before the commission is Mr Philip Brass, the former Managing Director of Pacific Dunlop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has, on its past record, appointed as commissioners people with the skills required. Clause 28(2) ensures that those appointments must be made on that basis. It is a broad power that allows the appointments to be made based on the functions of the commission and the inquiries at hand, and the government intends to continue appointing people with a range of skills. The downside of accepting the amendment is that it actually narrows the choices and the decision making of the government in trying to create a balance of skills and experience by ensuring that commissioners with special 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6266"> skills in each one of these areas are appointed as commissioners, regardless of the needs of the commission at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each one of these skills can be appointed depending on the work of the commission at the time. As we have said, there is already good evidence of what the government has done in terms of appointing people with specific skills. More importantly, if there are skills needed in a particular area of social welfare, industry or sustainable development, it is open for the commissioner at any time to use a range of consultants in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the arguments that the government would proffer in opposition to the amendment. We think the bill as it stands provides what the amendment would seek to do but it does it in a more broad and flexible way.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are issues in relation to whether or not you truly do believe that those agreed functions that the Senate has talked about earlier are functions of the commission or something you simply apply if you have an inquiry which has something similar in the name.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the issues that comes up for me in terms of being a Green politician is that most of the issues that affect things such as social justice, environment and even peace and disarmament do not necessarily come up in bills that are called social justice, peace and disarmament and environment bills. They are actually embedded in other laws. They could be tax laws, customs laws or industry laws. They change the way people relate to ecological sustainability. They punish or penalise certain activities or they move people away from other things. So, in reality, unless you actually do accept that these are functions, they do not necessarily happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am currently reading a book by a former New Zealand politician, Marilyn Waring. She mentioned a major multilateral aid agency which had as its stated goals that the program should be, for instance, fully cognisant of the needs of women in development, recognising the very important role of targeting women, because they tend to be a means of making things happen within society, especially in small communities. However, when it came 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> down to it, the actual programs&mdash;with all the good words and all the good agreed functions&mdash;did not work that way because those people who were making decisions within the organisations on an ongoing basis did not know how to implement them. The bells did not ring as to how they actually change their function and how they actually recognised within their normal day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day operation how to implement the policies and functions that they were meant to implement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would go along with the proposal that unless you actually have those people with that sense within them of what to look for, many things will go by which do affect all of those functions and nobody will know. In the end we will come back a year or two later and say, `We have these good words in section 8, but what have you done about them?'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This revised amendment No. 641 from Senator Sherry of the Labor Party encapsulates the earlier amendment we circulated, and we drop it in favour of this amendment. I think the points made by the parliamentary secretary really go to the root of the problem&mdash;that is, throughout our institutions and throughout our statutory board, committee and authority process, there are virtually no guidelines, protocols or established criteria by which appointments to really vital positions are made. That applies whether you are talking about the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the appointments of High Court judges or commissioners being appointed to the Productivity Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a problem which at last was recognised and dealt with in the United Kingdom, where they introduced the Nolan committee recommendations, which clearly established the criteria under which such appointments should be made. In due course, we in the Democrats hope to see that the proper principles under which appointments are made come into practice in this country as well because in all these things we have to rely on the good offices of what is inevitably a partisan government. That is the nature of government; it is partisan.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6267">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that this amendment will improve the community's perception that commissioners have been of a biased and unsatisfactory nature in commission work which has been of fundamental importance to the Australian community and the Australian economy. This amendment adds to the requirements that commissioners&mdash;there are only three spelt out&mdash;must have extensive skills and experience in the principles of ecologically sustainable development and environmental conservation. I note that many businesses are now accepting those as desirable goals for themselves to follow. Commissioners must have extensive skills and experience in dealing with the social effects of economic adjustment and social welfare service delivery and extensive skills and experience acquired in working in Australian industry, which leads to a very practical approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I understand that it will constrain you to some degree in a minority of appointments made to the commission, I would urge you, parliamentary secretary, to consider at some future date laying down more fully the broad and general principles and criteria in legislation under which these sorts of vital appointments should be made. It should be no surprise to you, having heard what I have had to say, to know that I will be supporting Labor in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think that in the past some reports have used the environment almost as a footnote or a throwaway line and that the benefits have been oversold relative to the costs, especially in the long term. We just hope that these sorts of guides to the government&mdash;these sorts of requirements on the government&mdash;will improve the range and character of the people who will serve the community on the commission. Accordingly, I commend Labor's amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

In the modern world consultants are becoming more and more prevalent and, given the significant increase in the functions of the Productivity Commission vis-a-vis the old Industry Commission, we believe that it is appropriate that&mdash;as we have moved in respect to the letting and engagement of a contract for services or a contract of service&mdash;this should occur after engaging in an open, transparent, competitive tendering process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In amendment 14 we have moved that in this process the terms of the engagement of a consultant under subsection 1 should be published by the commission in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6270"> so that we ensure that in this very important new commission a transparent situation will result.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a very important area for the Labor opposition. I am sure that Senator Campbell will point out that the offences that are set out for the Productivity Commission are the same as those for the Industry Commission, and he would be correct. So let me deal with that issue firstly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have one of my acknowledged experts in this area, Senator Cooney, who will be making some contribution to the debate. He is far 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more authoritative, knowledgeable and experienced in this particular area than I am, so I am not going to speak for an enormous amount of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may have been valid to have had these offences in respect of the Industry Commission but we are dealing with a proposed new Productivity Commission which has enormously enhanced functions. This is a productivity commission which is taking on the role of the old Industry Commission, EPAC and the BIE as well as being given additional powers in a number of other areas. So it has the power of the three old organisations as well as new powers and there has been a transference, in part 7, of the offences from the Industry Commission. Given the increased functions of the commission and what will be a greatly enhanced Industry Commission, we have argued earlier that it is the tiger unleashed in a metamorphosed form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to us inappropriate that the offences that are outlined in part 7 should have very heavy and draconian penalties carried over to the Productivity Commission. There are a number of significant powers the commission will have in respect of offences. Just to run through those quickly, they include hindering or disrupting the commission, intimidation and notice to persons to provide information and documents. Given the context of the new functions of the commission, I am very concerned about this notice to persons to provide information and documents.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but the new Productivity Commission is greatly expanded in its functions, Senator Harradine. When you look at the list of functions in 6(1) and reflect on the combination of the three organisations, plus the additional powers, the Productivity Commission becomes a much more significant body than the Industry Commission, with significant powers of enforcement. There are also other sections here dealing with false or misleading evidence or information, restriction on publication of evidence, documents produced in relation to an inquiry, allowance to witnesses, and a number of other references. So we have concern about the six&hyphen;month imprisonment in a number of areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have sought to do is submit, in the case of amendment 15, page 32, line 31, to do with notices to persons to provide information and documents, a penalty of $50 rather than imprisonment for six months. On page 32, clause 52, we have suggested a change, and my colleague Senator Cooney, with his legal background, can deal with that. It is a similar principle right through the particular amendments to the other clauses, 53 and 54. We think that in those areas the level of penalty that we have suggested in our amendments is more appropriate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a matter for some concern. I think what will be said from the government side is that this is a usual sort of process, that if you have got a body such as the Productivity Commission is going to be then you need to be able to enforce certain actions or certain proposals on their part. If they are going to hold an inquiry there are certain things that should be open to the person who is conducting that inquiry, such as getting evidence and making sure it comes before the commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that Senator Sherry is right, that this goes beyond what is reasonable. If you look at proposed section 50, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person must not:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) obstruct or hinder a member of the Commission in the performance of the Commission's functions&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">So, if a commissioner is writing something on the tram or is discussing a matter with someone and somebody obstructs or hinders the member, then in doing that, outside the hearing function, he or she is liable to a penalty of six months imprisonment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, under section 53, the chairman may summons a person in writing to appear at a hearing to give evidence and to produce documents specified in the summons. If the person does not attend on that summons, there is a penalty of up to six months imprisonment. And under section 46 the chairman can delegate his functions to a commissioner, so the commissioner who is hearing the matter can both serve the document&mdash;issue the document and have it served&mdash;and then provide evidence that that has not been attended to. I take it that the chairman or commissioner would then have to go off to court to prove that, but nevertheless it is unusual in the general scheme of things to have what in effect is a tribunal issuing its own summons and then having the capacity to see people punished for failing to attend to the summons they are issuing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate on matters of public interest to report the release of a very important report called the Information Policy Advisory Council report on on&hyphen;line services. This report heralds the policies that Australia should be developing as the information age comes upon us. The report was released last week by the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston. I want to congratulate the minister for the speedy release of this report. It acknowledges the urgency of this matter for Australia, which the report says is at the cross&hyphen;roads in terms of information industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes in technology that are now coming about are equivalent for Australia of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6273"> the time of the industrial revolution. The move into the information age is as significant as the move into the industrial age 150 years ago. Governments have to have the policy frameworks in place to cater for this incredible shift in economic activity and take into account all its social and personal consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report from the Information Policy Advisory Council provides us with the blueprint for doing that. It outlines the way in which the nation should prepare in gearing up to these new technologies. This comprehensive report, which I will return to in detail shortly, was presented only one year after its commissioning. I commend the Howard government for also establishing parallel to this a very powerful interdepartmental committee called the Commonwealth of Information, which is chaired by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). It has senior cabinet ministers representing all key departments that are related to the information age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of that group is to determine strategies for on&hyphen;line information and communication services that are significant to Australia's prosperity within the growing global information economy. We now have three reports from the government to assist the nation in this transition to the information age. This IPAC report, the Goldsworthy report and the Mortimer report are all vital in the national interest as we undergo this shift.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I told the Senate in a series of speeches almost three years ago, the information age for Australia is a reality, and we are now on notice to embrace the information age or suffer the consequences of the economic loss that Australia will face if we do not undertake this new path. Thankfully, the implementation of policy response is now out of Labor's  ineffective hands. If you look at the appalling record of the ALP on this matter in those vital years of the early nineties as we approached the information age, you find that there were many missed opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former ALP government's approach to this was best characterised by the former minister, Mr Lee, sitting on his hands. They did set up what they called the broadband services expert group, which developed a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> report under the chairmanship of Brian Johns. It reported in December 1993. They then tabled the final report in July 1994. The final recommendations appeared in 1995, and by the time they had lost government in 1996 nothing had happened. We had an interim report from 1993 through to 1996. We lost a quarter of a decade while they wondered what they would do about it. When they left office, they had not implemented any of the recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Barry Jones, the member for Lalor and the ALP national president, used these words on ABC radio in July 1994 to describe the ALP government's performance on matters relating to the information age:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We tend to react to things . . . we tend to stumble into things. Oh really we ought to have a policy response to that. But we don't anticipate changes, we react to them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Labor left a structural situation where Australia's information industries were underweight and underdeveloped. Labor did nothing to turn around the slow trend of Australian companies to reinvent themselves to make themselves ready for the information age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague Senator Alston and the Howard government are now seizing this opportunity. It is vital that they do that because the information economy is a reality with growing users and services. Across the world there are 50 million users of Internet services. Getting ready for the information age are countries such as Malaysia, the USA, Ireland and Japan which have developed special industry zones reserved for information industries to attract those industries to their countries. Australia should be well placed at this time. We have people who use these sorts of services quite extensively. We now have one million estimated users of the Internet, which puts Australia fourth in the world in terms of per capita usage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians rapidly adopt new technologies. One in five over the age of 16 have used the Internet. Ten per cent of Australian households have on&hyphen;line connections. On&hyphen;line services provide some five million&hyphen;plus sources of information and connection, and this is growing exponentially. We have on&hyphen;line libraries which people can access from a wide 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6274"> range of centres around the country. We have movies on demand; entertainment is just over the horizon. People are  increasingly studying for degrees by external studies through the services provided by information technology. Right across the country we now have instant communication through E&hyphen;mail, and the whole area of electronic business and commerce is growing very rapidly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my view that Australia has the capacity to benefit from the rapidly changing world of on&hyphen;line commerce. We must take action to capitalise on our opportunities&mdash;but it is action that is needed now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The information industry sector is big and growing, and we must understand the unique nature of this new economy. In 1995 it represented $65 billion in economic activity world wide. It should not be categorised and seen in traditional terms, like we perhaps look at the steel industry or the motorcar industry. It is a grouping of very different activities that range across a wide range of products and services, including electronic components, hardware and computer software, through to communication networks and content production. These elements are bound together in a chain of value adding services through to the delivery point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The IPAC report rightly says that Australia is at the crossroads and facing technological change as we move from the industrial age to the information age. The report emphasises:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A sense of urgency is required. We need to be bold and ambitious.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So what is the potential value of electronic commerce to Australia? IPAC reports this in some optimistic detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On&hyphen;line transactions on the Internet and information based production is forecast to capture a rapidly growing share of international economic activity. This growth is reflected in the supply side, which is growing at three to four times the rate of the national economy. Further, the bulk of new jobs and sales growth in the leading national economies is directly attributable to the exploitation of information and communication technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must turn potential into reality because, as it stands, Australia is still a bystander in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the electronic international trade sector. At present we represent a trivial 0.3 per cent of the global market share of this new information age. Our share compares very unfavourably with the shares of other smaller Asian economies. Singapore, for example, represents 6.9 per cent of the world's share; Malaysia has 5.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The IPAC report recommendations set out a framework for action to ensure that the Australian government and businesses improve on this poor sharing and take up the immediate challenges of the information era. The report recommends that Australia invest in education at all levels to produce a skilled work force to allow us to operate successfully in the global information economy. It recommends that we relax immigration rules for people with demonstrated on&hyphen;line skills to enter Australia. It suggests that we develop a national uniform on&hyphen;line policy where action by federal and state governments has an orientation to building and funding on&hyphen;line technologies. It also recommends that we improve our access to global distribution channels and networks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to increase the international recognition of Australian on&hyphen;line products, and we need to further develop the capital markets to finance technology based enterprises that use information formats. We need to enact legislation for electronic commerce and on&hyphen;line transactions that address new developments, including digital signatures, certification and electronic authentication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the IPAC report outlines some vital elements of reform in this new information age. I am particularly attracted to the IPAC recommendation that we aggressively implement competition policy in telecommunications to ensure the world's lowest price advantage for Australia with our major on&hyphen;line trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only last week Senator Alston provided to the Senate dramatic evidence that shows that Australia now has one of the most liberalised and effective telecommunication networks in the world. There have been substantial price reductions announced by carriers since 1 July 1997, when we opened up the telecommunications market. A company called AAPT an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6275"> nounced a 60 per cent reduction of current costs for national and international long distance calls. Primus&hyphen;Globe&hyphen;Talk has reduced its international call rate for all Australian customers. WorldxChange is now offering a flat rate of 39c per minute for calls to the United States. Telstra is now offering local call deals as low as 18c for households and 12c for high volume business customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the minister, I believe that a great deal has occurred, and more cost savings for telecommunications are in prospect. This development, this very rapid change, is placing Australia well for these new products and services in the information age. I fully support other developments that the government is now involved with, including new electronic commerce centres that allow small businesses in like fields&mdash;like aquiculture and dairying&mdash;to get on&hyphen;line delivery and services nationally and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This IPAC report is to be recommended. It outlines a blueprint for structural adjustment which will take our economy into the information age. I commend the report and its contents to the Senate and to the nation.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6275"><TITLE>Discrimination Against Women</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In July the Australian government had to report to the United Nations on its policies that implement our obligations under the Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. I am surprised that, since the United Nations issued its report, the minister, Senator Newman, has not, to my knowledge, spoken publicly about its recom 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mendations and how she proposes to implement them. I am hoping that I can remind her of her obligations in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CEDAW committee said in response to the Australian government's report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government should carefully monitor the impact of recent policy changes in all areas covered by the Convention for inclusion in its next periodic report. . . [and] conduct analyses of the successes and shortcomings of the new policies. . . It recommended that the Government design a long-term strategy aimed at the full implementation of the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am sure Senator Newman is working on that, but I think both this chamber and indeed the Australian electorate would like to hear from her about the plans that this government has to not only meet its responsibilities as a signatory to the convention, but to take up the recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were a number of areas of concern. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was concerned about the Government's apparent shift in attention and commitment to the human rights of women and the achievement of gender equality. Indications such as the cut by 38 per cent in the budget of the Office of the Status of Women gave rise to concern. While increased efforts at gender mainstreaming into all sectoral areas were commendable, the Committee was concerned about the weakened role of national machinery in providing policy advice on equality issues.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would have to ask: has Senator Newman insisted at cabinet that the advice of the Office of the Status of Women on the need to retain the Sex Discrimination Commissioner's position&mdash;and indeed I would argue the other commissioners that specialise in their relevant areas of expertise&mdash;be maintained? It is extraordinary to think that in 1997 there could still be a debate about whether or not Australia needs a sex discrimination commissioner, but in the end that is precisely the debate that is still being held within cabinet circles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Senator Newman were to detail this forward&hyphen;looking strategy as recommended, it would make it much easier for her to add weight to the need to retain the sex discrimination position. The committee went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was alarmed by policy changes that apparently slowed down, or reversed, Australia's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6276"> progress in achieving equality between women and men, such as in housing and childcare programmes, and in employment assistance. It was concerned about the delay in appointing a Sex Discrimination Commissioner and about the Government's declared intention to change its  human rights policy and legislation as it pertained to women.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee expressed its concern that at a time of fiscal constraint, resources for programmes and policies benefiting women or aimed at overcoming discrimination, such as in health, in the provision of legal aid services, of training and awareness programmes for health workers, judicial, professional and others on violence against women, might be subjected to disproportionate budget cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted with concern that violence against women, notwithstanding major efforts, remained a central concern to Australian women. . . </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted with concern that legislation on industrial relations providing for the negotiation of individual contracts between employer and employee may have a disproportionately negative impact on women. Part-time and casual workers, of which women formed a disproportionate share, are usually in a weaker position than other workers to negotiate favourable working agreements, in particular with regard to benefits. The reservation to the Convention with regard to paid maternity leave, and Australia's non-ratification of ILO Convention 103, remain a  concern for women workers with family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Acting Deputy President, I would remind senators that these are statements that are being made by those people who are expert in monitoring the progress of countries around the world. These are not comments coming from the opposition, though of course we have made these points in debate repeatedly over the last 12 to 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I want to put it very firmly on the public record that Australia is risking losing its very forward&hyphen;looking reputation that it had during the 1980s when the previous Labor government gave a major commitment to gender equality issues, gender policy development, women's budgeting, child care and all the programs that particularly focused on the need for women to be given a greater say and equality within society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure from my conversations with a number of women members and senators from 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the government that they share my concern. But, to date, they have not been able to get that level of concern reflected in cabinet decision making. I understand that. I have sat at the cabinet table. I know there are misogynists around this parliament. There are also many men who are very supportive of women having an equal role in the participation of decision making and all aspects of community life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sympathise with government women, but I say to them&mdash;and particularly to Senator Newman&mdash;that it is time they stood up to be counted. They cannot always hide behind cabinet solidarity or support for what is the predominant view within the party room. When women were elected to the coalition, they were elected on the basis that they would speak out strongly on these issues. Regrettably, I feel they must be being constrained or we would not have received this report from the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The United Nations made some suggestions and recommendations. I actually called it something of a 10-point plan for the equality of women. We have still to hear from the government as to how they are going to respond. The report went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommended that the Government should carefully monitor the impact of recent policy changes in all areas covered by the Convention . . . It recommended that the Government design a long-term strategy . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They particularly singled out the need for an evaluation of the Workplace Relations Act and an assessment of its impact on women of different age groups with different educational levels and in different occupational groups, and especially to focus on part time and casual women workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee further encouraged the government to assess the benefits of a continuing national women's health policy&mdash;again, an area that is subject to much concern among women generally, particularly those who work in the women's health area. Because of negotiations for devolution to the states, there is, to my knowledge&mdash;and I am happy to be corrected&mdash;because I talk with women health workers quite consistently, no guaranteed protection to maintain the momen 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6277"> tum built up by the national women's health strategy over nearly 10 years now. We cannot, I think, trust state governments to automatically put the priority on these issues that have previously been set at the national level. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommended that the Convention, as well as the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action should be translated for non-English&hyphen;speaking Australians.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Has that issue been taken up with Mr Ruddock? It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommended that a comprehensive strategy to eliminate violence against women should be adopted following the National Domestic Violence Summit.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I commend the government for holding a summit, but we have to have the commitment and the resources to follow through. There are so many financial cutbacks, both in the legal aid area and in resourcing, particularly to women in rural areas, that all the fine words that may be expressed at the summit will come to nothing if there is not a commensurate commitment to dollar resources. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted differing state provisions in relation to prostitution and encouraged the Government to assess the effectiveness of varying measures in reducing the exploitation of prostitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee encouraged the Government to collect statistical data on the participation of indigenous women in the work force, in decision&hyphen;making, in politics and administration, and in the judiciary.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On a positive note, I want to commend Senator Newman and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for the choice of indigenous women in terms of the constitutional convention. That is a positive move, and I acknowledge it. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommended that, in the light of Mabo and Wik judgments of the High Court, the Government should develop the necessary legislative and policy measures to ensure women's equal access to . . . native land.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is an area that will be of considerable interest to this chamber in the coming months. Are women's views in relation to, particularly, the 10-point plan being considered by the government? The report continues:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee encouraged the Government to strengthen its support for women's studies, to provide funding for research and teaching, and to facilitate international academic exchange and cooperation in that field.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I wonder if Minister Vanstone has had that recommendation placed within her area of responsibility. I would also note that it is very important that the officers of the Office of the Status of Women be resourced both physically&mdash;in terms of staffing&mdash;and with travel to allow them to continue to play the role that Australia has played in the last 10 or so years in leading on gender policy issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it very sad that the office has been so dramatically cut, which places a great deal of stress on those dedicated officers who are still doing their best to maintain the input on all decisions affecting women. Of course, we know women's issues are not some narrow little basket over here. We have to have a gender perspective across all areas of government decision making. Frankly, I am not convinced that this government has yet acknowledged that. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee encouraged the Government to resume its active and visible participation in international forums on women's equality . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It also recommended that the government ensure there is wide dissemination of this report so that women in the Australian community can monitor this government's progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I appeal to Senator Newman to mobilise all those women on the government side and go to the Prime Minister and insist that gender policy be given a high priority by this government. There is no point having elected a large number of women to the coalition ranks&mdash;and I congratulated them on a non-partisan basis for that&mdash;if they are not allowed to do anything. What are they allowed to do if we get this kind of report from the United Nations?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a lot of rebuilding to do. There is a lot of work that Senator Newman and her women colleagues, in consultation with the Prime Minister and cabinet, must address. I hope that we will hear from Senator Newman. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on a topic which has been the subject of a spate of attacks by politicians and public figures in recent weeks and months&mdash;that is, the High Court of Australia and its judges. While it is healthy for any public institution to be subject to public appraisal, the strength and tenure of recent attacks on the High Court and its judges has placed a renewed focus on the composition, role and function of the High Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The confidence of the community in the High Court has been deliberately eroded for political reasons. It is important, indeed vital, that the community maintain a high level of confidence in the highest court of the land. One method of doing this is to ensure that there is confidence in the appointments process. We must, as a nation, protect the reputation, independence and legitimacy of the High Court and its office holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has failed to take the lead on this issue and to depoliticise judicial appointments. Indeed, it has done the reverse. The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Tim Fischer, has deliberately politicised the debate with his comments that the coalition intends to introduce capital `C' conservative coalition judges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unsatisfactory that under the current system we must simply trust that the Commonwealth Attorney-General, who is responsible for the appointment of judges, consults with the Chief Justice of the High Court, the state attorneys&hyphen;general and relevant presidents of law societies in determining who, according to convention, is the most eminent and capable barrister or judge. This is a problem which is reinforced because, historically, such persons have tended to be from a common background, and the inference has therefore been that appointments to the High Court have been affected by that social bias. They are regarded, rightly or wrongly, as establishment figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our view the current method of appointment is archaic and inadequate for an open and modern democratic system that rests on the doctrine of the separation of powers. A transparent, open and independent selection 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> process must be put in place if we are to safeguard the judiciary and improve accountability. The principles of open government must be applied to the appointments process. Its workings must be transparent, and information about appointments must be disclosed to parliament and the public. Many establishment figures will resist such changes, being comfortable with the old ways. But the campaign of the Deputy Prime Minister and others of his ilk has, in my view, placed the appointments of High Court judges in real danger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The three principal weaknesses with the current system of appointment of judges to the High Court of Australia are that, firstly, the qualifications for appointment are not adequately prescribed; secondly, there is no regulation or established selection procedure; and, thirdly, there is an absence of effective external scrutiny of appointments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current method of appointment is of concern for a number of reasons. Judicial appointments tend to be clouded in secrecy, making it impossible to determine the process by which a choice is made. This does not serve to promote or protect judicial independence, nor does it enhance public confidence or trust in the judiciary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the separation of the powers, appointments to the High Court are still made by the executive. This creates a risk that the independence of the judiciary is weakened or even undermined by the appearance of ministerial patronage connected to judicial appointments to the High Court, a perception of patronage which is specifically confirmed by the remarks of the Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those statements have exposed the establishment's long complicity in the now explicit expectation of the executive that they can bypass the separation of powers and appoint judges to the High Court who are not politically independent. Therefore, the principles of open government have to be applied to the appointments process. Its workings must be transparent, and information about appointments must be disclosed to parliament and the public.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6279">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to reduce the politicisation of the judiciary, appointment methods should be scrutinised by an independent body such as those recommended in the Australian Democrats's model which I released recently. These failings in the current method of appointments mean that there exists no real accountability in respect of judicial appointments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth constitution sets out basic requirements and restrictions on the make&hyphen;up of appointment to the High Court and on the qualifications of appointees. The constitution provides that the High Court shall consist of a chief justice; there should be at least two other justices&mdash;currently there are six, plus the chief justice; appointments should be made by the Governor-General in council, which is made on the advice of the executive, incidentally; and appointees must be less than 70 years old.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court of Australia Act 1979 adds some basic but important requirements on appointments. It provides that the Commonwealth Attorney&hyphen;General consult with the attorneys&hyphen;general of the states before an appointment is made and that the candidate must have served as a judge of a court or must have been enrolled as a barrister or solicitor for not less than five years. These requirements are minimal, and one of them is largely discretionary, and they do not set in place procedures or criteria which ensure an open and transparent selection process based on merit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aim of the appointment process to the High Court should be to make the selection process transparent and open to scrutiny, to ensure that appointment is on the basis of merit and to ensure that no artificial barriers prevent the appointment of women and other under&hyphen;represented groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats have therefore recommended that a judicial appointments committee be established as a selection and advisory body, that selection criteria be established and made public to assist in the evaluation of suitable candidates, and that the selection criteria be recorded in a protocol and be reviewed periodically by the judicial appointments committee.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A judicial appointments committee should be established to select and recommend appointees to the High Court. We think that that committee should comprise at least seven members. We believe the members should include the following: the Commonwealth Attorney-General; one representative nominated by the Australian Bar Association; one representative nominated by the Law Council of Australia; one academic with expertise in constitutional law; one community representative; and two representatives of the states nominated by COAG, the joint Australian governments committee.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The function of the judicial appointments committee would be to scrutinise applicants and recommend the selection of future High Court judges who are then to be appointed by the Governor&hyphen;General; establish and publish the qualifications for appointment and selection criteria; and record in a protocol qualifications for appointment and selection criteria to be reviewed periodically by the judicial appointments committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The qualifications, skills and experience which are required for appointees to the High Court should be clearly set out in the selection criteria. Merit must be the overriding principle governing selections for appointments to the High Court, not Mr Fischer's capital `C' conservative coalition political criteria. Equal opportunity principles must be included in the selection processes as well as consideration given to non&hyphen;traditional and minority representation in the make&hyphen;up of the bench.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Individuals selected for appointments must be independent from government, independent from political parties and independent from other politically partisan organisations. Individuals selected for appointment must match standards of probity and must satisfy the appropriate level of professionalism. Establishing a system of appointment which provides for independent scrutiny of applicants and which sets out the selection criteria and the method of appointment for the High Court of Australia would provide transparency; it would reduce the potential for political appointments; it would broaden the representation within the court; it would safeguard the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6280"> independence of the judiciary; and it would improve accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also would defeat the declared and deliberate intention of this government to appoint judges of a particular flavour. The Australian Democrats and I do not want capital `C' conservative judges or capital `L' Liberal or Labor judges. We want capital `I' independent judges selected for their capital `M' merit. We have therefore commended our model to the Senate. We regret that the Senate, through the major parties, saw fit to reject our recommendations. We continue to urge the government to implement our model before the next two judicial appointments to the High Court, which are due early next year.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6280"><TITLE>Green Corps</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Friday marked the successful completion of round one of the Commonwealth Green Corps initiative, `young Australians for the environment'. On Friday the Green Corps participants in the 24 round&hyphen;one projects attended graduation ceremonies which celebrated their achievements over the last six months. I am sure all honourable senators share with me the admiration of these young people who have volunteered&mdash;I emphasise `volunteered'&mdash;to join the Green Corps. They are genuinely committed to the future of Australia and genuinely committed to improving the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The completion of the first round marks the delivery of a key election commitment by this government. The Green Corps is a commitment to help young people and a commitment to help the Australian environment. Australia has daunting environmental problems, ranging from salinisation of our best farmlands to weed invasion of our most treasured national parks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recognition of these problems the government announced the Natural Heritage Trust, which will deliver a better environment for all Australians. Green Corps sits beside the Natural Heritage Trust as another strategy 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to assist the efforts to improve the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a society, we are trying to do less damage to the environment which sustains us. But remedying 200 years of neglect and outright vandalism is a massive task, requiring in many cases a great deal of painstaking and skilful hands-on work. Just as we are concerned to restore our land to its potential, we also want our young people to reach their potential, and Green Corps is effective training&mdash;intelligent, 1990s skills training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because Green Corps is managed on the government's behalf by a leading private sector environmental organisation, it has harnessed private sector methods to Public Service objectives. Occasionally a government program perfectly meets the needs of the time and fires the imagination of a country. The Green Corps program is one of these. It is young people participating in projects designed to allow them to demonstrate their commitment to improving Australia's natural and cultural environment. At the same time, they are helping the community and learning new skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to undertaking a major environmental project, Green Corps participants also receive training. Last Friday I had the pleasure and honour of attending the graduation of the Green Corps participants at Merimbula. The trainees at Merimbula were trained in environmental auditing, first aid, land conservation, occupational health and safety, introduction to chainsaw safety, weed control, park pathway construction, planting and on&hyphen;site practical use of tools. That sort of training received by that particular Green Corps is mirrored and multiplied right throughout Australia in all the various Green Corps projects under way at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Green Corps participants are required to commit 40 hours per week for 26 weeks, the duration of the project. The skills achieved by Green Corps participants are many and varied. Again in the case of the Merimbula group, the participants received skills relating to power tool use, environmental design, team work, leadership, commitment, responsibility, reliability and a respect for our environment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6281">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we see that young people who have recently graduated from the Green Corps program have developed these new skills and have developed confidence. They have a certain knowledge of their ability to take on complex tasks and to see them through to completion. They can also be assured that in doing this they have committed not only to the local communities in which they have undertaken their projects but also to the Australian community at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To this end, the Green Corps has built into it a community service component. This component of the project involves the participants identifying how they believe they can contribute to the community in which they are working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that Green Corps team members will come back with their friends and families, and in time their children, to visit their projects and say with justifiable pride that they took part in the Green Corps and contributed to this walking track or that repair of an eroded area, or participated in some other way in a Green Corps project right around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They will be able to identify what they have learnt about their environment from the work they have done, and they will be able to say with some pride that they were instrumental in preserving a part of Australia's flora and fauna or as the case may be, depending on their particular Green Corps project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far we have received a lot of positive feedback, particularly from participants, supervisors and the partner agencies. By sitting and talking to the participants and encouraging their ideas and feedback, we will be able to continue to improve the program and make sure that it meets the government's aims and objectives, improves the environment and gives training and incentive to the young people involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because it has been such a well received program, I was a little disappointed recently to hear the carping criticism from one particular senator, who is becoming known for her carping, who obviously has not taken the trouble to understand the Green Corps or to get her facts correct. The Green Corps is not&mdash;I repeat not&mdash;an employment program. It is an environmental initiative for volun 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> teers&mdash;I emphasise `volunteers'&mdash;who receive a training wage strictly according to the award, and they also receive training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amongst the many positive comments from participants and others alike, I have seen only one complaint. Interestingly, it was the one that the senator mentioned recently, which, curiously, was not in a letter or a comment to government but in a letter to a newspaper copied to five politicians, two of whom were Democrat politicians. It was quite a well constructed letter but, interestingly again, for such a well constructed letter the names of the two Democrat senators were badly misspelt. I found that interesting. If any senator has suggestions about how to improve this exciting initiative and has a genuine interest in the environment, as opposed to trying to score a couple of cheap political points, I would welcome that input just as I do welcome and do actually receive input from participants in these programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give full recognition to these projects, the government has provided funds for a plaque to be erected in each Green Corps project location, which will list the names of the young volunteers involved and will also list the partner agency. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and as one with a particular interest in the Green Corps program, I have attended a number of Green Corps project and group meetings right around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The project in Merimbula had significant environmental and training achievements, with the young participants reflecting that the project had boosted their self&hyphen;confidence and independence and had motivated many of them to take a greater interest in environmental management issues. I have got the same feeling from the visit I had and from the contact I have had with the Green Corps in my home town of Townsville. This is a great group of young people who have done very worthwhile work on the banks of the Ross River in conjunction with the Townsville City Council which, like all the partner agencies, has made a magnificent contribution to this program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, I have had the privilege of speaking with the participants and being involved 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6282"> with Green Corps projects in Cooktown and Malanda in north Queensland, and Sydney, amongst others, and they have all been particularly worthwhile experiences for me. In going to speak to these people, I have seen their enthusiasm for the work they have volunteered to do. I was particularly encouraged when one young participant said to me, `I am still not quite sure if I will devote my life to an environmental career but taking part in Green Corps has shown me how much hard physical work and money is required to ensure that we have a sustainable environment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many other comments from participants have indicated to me that they now take a much greater interest in our environment and in our country. Even if they do not proceed to training in environmental areas, they certainly have benefited very considerably from their involvement in the Green Corps. Many of the participants, however, have indicated that they will be pursuing environmental studies. If they do, of course, they will be receiving the government's $500 contribution towards the cost of the studies. Many of them will be going on to do that, but all of them have acknowledged the huge benefits that they have gained from their involvement. I and, I am sure, all honourable senators congratulate all of the participants throughout Australia in these Green Corps on their efforts. I am sure that all senators will again join me in wishing these participants and recent graduates well in the future.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6282"><TITLE>Information Technology</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak during the matters of public interest time on an issue that I certainly am very concerned about, given the direction of the federal government. The issue is information technology and its role in Australian society leading up to the new millennium. There has been a recent proliferation of reports prepared from a number of perspectives emanating from the government on this particular issue. The two I would like to make greatest reference to today are the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The global information economy: the way ahead </EMPHASIS> from the Information Industries Taskforce, commonly 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> known as the Goldsworthy report, and the report entitled  <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A national policy framework for structural adjustment within the new Commonwealth of information</EMPHASIS> , a product of the Information Policy Advisory Council and which I will refer to as the IPAC report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arrival of these two reports coincides with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) rediscovering or, perhaps in his case, discovering information technology as an issue of substance for the very first time. It is an issue that has been quite well documented in a global sense as well as in the Australian political context and certainly with great detail in the period of the previous Labor government. In the context of global dialogue about industry development and the future of the global economy, it is at the forefront of those discussions. But here in Australia our Prime Minister has just discovered information services and information technology, so much so that his discovery of this issue just happens to coincide with the delivery of a number of reports that attempt to position this government in such a way as to somehow focus a positive policy direction on that particular sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer briefly to some of the common themes within both of these reports as there are some very interesting similarities. The first is, of course, the positive commonality&mdash;that is, the high degree of emphasis that both reports place on industry intervention as a means by which the government can support and foster growth in this particular sector. The various proposals put forward in both the Goldsworthy and IPAC reports in relation to this have varying degrees of merit. It is not my intention today to explore specifically the substance of the particular measures proposed other than to say that the clamour from the private sector, from the industry, for the government to take far greater responsibility for industry development is very loud in all industries, and these two reports focus specifically on the fact that there is a lot of complaint from the IT sector about the lack of support from this current government. It is worth mentioning that the research and development incentives that the government has cut in previous budgets form an integral 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6283"> part of what has shaped industry's perception of neglect by this federal government in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another commonality between these two reports is not so positive but, again, is worthy of emphasis, given that it goes straight to the heart of the attitude of this government. That is that both reports state, at the very top of the priorities of government, that leadership is required from this government to show the commitment it has to the development of this critical industry sector. It is leadership that has been so lacking, and that is why the Prime Minister's recent discovery of IT as an issue lacks so much credibility. That is why it has been taken with a degree of contempt within the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lack of leadership at such a critical time in the development of this sector is what has denied this country not just 18 months of a critical growth period since this government has been in power but far longer than that in terms of impact because of the regressive steps this government has made with industry development policy: research and development incentive cuts, the computer bounty being denied and so forth. So we are not just talking about standing still for 18 months; we are also talking about an industry that has actually regressed under the lack of leadership of this federal Liberal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is, of course, a particularly sad indictment for all of those private sector entrepreneurs who were fooled into believing that this federal Liberal government was actually good for business, as was stated in just about every piece of election propaganda that it could associate itself with. Those lessons have been hard learnt by the private sector. Whilst this government has recently claimed to be supportive of this particular sector, the sector has learnt from bitter experience and bitter disappointment that this government can no longer be trusted in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another common theme within both of these reports that reflects on another critical issue confronting the IT sector at the moment. It is in relation to government procurement policies. The outsourcing of IT services in government departments has certainly not only been embarked upon in this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> year's budget decision by Minister Fahey to actually proceed upon a specific program to do that. What we have also seen is that both of these reports have taken the same path as Minister Fahey in respect of IT outsourcing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will explain what I am talking about. The path taken by all of these groups has been one that favours the position of the large corporations in the sector&mdash;the multinationals, the top end of town or whatever you want to call them. The involvement of those corporations&mdash;whether it is through their involvement in advising the Office of Government Information Technology and the Department of Finance or whether it is through their involvement in the respective boards and committees that have prepared these reports&mdash;has ensured a structural bias in these proposals against local indigenous Australian small to medium enterprises in the IT sector. There is no other way of describing the alienation and the exclusion of that part of the industry in all of these proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not once have I seen a recommendation or a policy proposal forthcoming from this government that turns specifically to the needs of the local small business IT sector. In fact, in a greatly detailed exploration of the outsourcing plans of this federal government, we find evidence of very specific cases of exclusion of these firms to the point where their very involvement in the competitive process for the outsourcing of the IT services of Commonwealth departments hinges upon the benevolence of a multinational to take a local company under its wing in some form of partnership or subcontract arrangement and hence allow its participation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a structural issue that emerges from the concept of a competitive regime as being what delivers savings to government. The problem is that, in a competitive regime delivering savings to government, the people advising government of those structures are the ones who have said from the outset that the savings will come only through efficiencies relating to size. It is their magnitude that allows them to provide those returns or savings to government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I offer a couple of other points. First of all, if the prerequisite of the delivery of those savings to government relates to size and cost 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6284"> efficiencies, why is the evidence not there in a global context that those savings are actually forthcoming? We have a couple of Australian and many global examples of the savings being advocated prior to an IT outsourcing arrangement not being realised in many cases in the short, medium and long term. So it is interesting to note that, now that we have exposed that reality, we hear justification of the outsourcing process of government IT services now being for reasons of industry development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This quite specific shift by the government in justifying its IT outsourcing can again be explained very simply by looking towards the actual structural processes that have been put in place for that IT outsourcing. They go straight to the heart of the ability of the larger corporations, multinational ones, to allegedly facilitate and foster sector growth in the particular area in which they establish themselves. So we are seeing a change in position as the debate evolves around IT outsourcing in industry development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last point I want to make about outsourcing is this: it is too easy to pocket small local IT business in one area and large multinational corporations in another and have a political debate about who is in favour and who is not in favour. The facts are that, in this industry, there is a combination of all of those entities. We have multinational corporations with regional offices which operate very much at a local level. They employ local people, they have a local development plan, a local business plan and they bring great benefit to the local economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, given this blend for the purposes of the point I am trying to make, I am talking about the vertically integrated corporations who do not seek to establish regional offices with the degree of autonomy that contributes to the local economies. I am talking about the companies that seize the opportunity to secure massive contracts and then, for the purposes of delivering the promised savings, deal with the management of their work force and the management of the services that they provide and the equipment that they provide in a way that directly disadvantages, first, job prospects for Australian people and, second, the equip 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment supply sector that has traditionally fed Australian demand for hardware and software.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is those sorts of issues that must be addressed quite specifically in any government procurement or outsourcing strategy. It also addresses the need for a more complex analysis of multinationals and small Australian businesses to see who is returning the benefits in terms of jobs, revenue to the local economy and industry development incentives, innovation growth and so forth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summing up, it is a sad day when you see two generally well constructed reports&mdash;although certainly lacking in some depth&mdash;focus their primary issue on the lack of leadership in this area in this country. It is a vindication of the neglect of industry that both reports advocate the high level of industry intervention that has not been forthcoming under this government, which has left this industry not just at a standstill for the last 18 months since the Liberals have been in power but, in fact, regressed and denied a significant proportion of growth that would have continued to occur under the sound policies that fostered growth put in place by the Labor government.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6284"><TITLE>Proposed Goods and Services Tax</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of a GST means that there will be a broadly based tax on all aspects of education: child care; kindergarten; books; school uniforms; private school fees; tutorial assistance; private music or foreign language lessons; sporting equipment and uniforms; university union fees; HECS fees; library fees; meals at school or university; train and bus tickets; project materials; science equipment; and paintings.

Education must be affordable at all levels for parents and students, both local and overseas. A GST will undermine the competitiveness of Australian education. As a nation, we cannot allow this to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of myths peddled by our opponents about the benefits of the GST. This is very important. The first myth the coalition government try to peddle is that Australia is one of the highest taxed nations in the world. Unfortunately, the statistics do not bear this out. In comparison with most other developed countries, Australia has a much lower proportion of income tax in its national tax take. Australia is at 54 per cent; the OECD average is at 61 per cent. That is once you add in the social security levies they have in other countries, which coalition conveniently members leave out when they make these comparisons. Australia's level of taxation is 8.5 per cent of GDP, which is lower than the average of comparable countries. We pay $40 billion less than we would if we were taxed at the average levels of OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next myth they peddle is that Australia is to reliant on income tax. But when it comes 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to taxes on goods and services as a proportion of the overall national tax cake, Australia is more or less equal to the average of advanced industrial countries. Australia is about 30 per cent; the OECD is about 32 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then they say that there would be less tax avoidance with the GST. This is probably the cruellest trick the coalition is trying to pull. They want people to believe that a GST will end tax avoidance. There is no correlation between a country having a GST and having a small black economy. Currently, income from trade in personal services often escapes income tax through non&hyphen;declaration. Imposing a GST on personal services, for example, home maintenance, would actually increase the incentive for non&hyphen;declaration of income, thereby allowing both GST and income tax to be evaded. While it is true that the spending on this black economy income would involve some GST being paid, some taxes are already paid on the spending through the existing wholesale sales tax and excise system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another claim they make is that a GST is going to increase the savings ratio. A GST is not the answer to improving national savings. There is no evidence of that happening. The Netherlands and Belgium both have consumption taxes. But while Belgium has the highest savings rate of the major OECD countries, at 16.5 per cent, the Netherlands has the lowest saving rate at 0.2 per cent. There is no evidence anywhere in the world that a GST will lead to an increase in savings.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3L6">Senator CONROY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just find it, Senator Ferguson. You find it and you table it in the Senate. Savings are simply deferred consumption. So if we increase our tax on consumer goods, that tax will be paid whether we spend it now or later. Hence it does not affect our decision when to spend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It makes exports cheaper&mdash;that is a hoary old chestnut that they trot out. If we improve the relative position of exports compared with imports by changing the tax base, making it rebatable, it is likely the benefit would be wiped out by an appreciation in the dollar. That is what happens in the real world. Let's have none of this myth peddling about how exports are going to be cheaper. You are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6287"> living in the 1970s with a fixed exchange rate. You are showing your age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the really obscene claim by the government is that the GST is going to fix unemployment. A GST is no solution to unemployment. The United States does not have a GST, but it does have one of the lower levels of unemployment among advanced countries. On the other hand, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, despite having GSTs, have high rates of unemployment, averaging around 12 per cent. Canada introduced a GST in 1991, but its unemployment rate remains high at 9.1 per cent.</PARA>

First, we had this government deciding that Holsworthy should no longer be considered as a site for Sydney's second airport, on environmental grounds; in other words, based not just on instincts but on an objective assessment of sound science which, in effect, ruled out Holsworthy.

We are a pro&hyphen;development government but developments have got to meet the highest environmental standards, and we have demonstrated that today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a good day today because a number of major Australian companies have reported on their first year of activities under the government's cooperative greenhouse challenge process. Honourable senators will recall that this is a process in which Australian companies joined with the Australian government voluntarily to reduce greenhouse gases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reports have been received today from BHP, Rio Tinto, Shell and ICI, as well as from a number of major industry organisations. And the reports are very good. BHP, for example, forecast that they will save eight million tonnes of CO2 by the year 2000, keeping their emissions to 1995 levels even with increased production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last 12 months, BHP have reduced their greenhouse gas emissions per tonne of coal from their New South Wales operations by 18 per cent and from their Queensland operations by 28 per cent. They should be commended. In the past 12 months, 52 projects were completed by Rio Tinto, which saved 563,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions. They have also committed themselves to a further reduction of 677,000 tonnes. ICI have saved an estimated 240,000 tonnes. Shell completed all their 1996 actions, which saved 6,000 tonnes of CO2. They are working towards savings of over 230,000 tonnes of CO2 in 1997.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I read the same press comment this morning, Senator Bolkus. It was probably sourced by you; I am not sure. The important thing is that we are proud of the fact that nearly a quarter of the non&hyphen;parliamentary appointments are of young people between the ages of 18 and 25, and that each state and territory is represented. Some of these young people nominated themselves to us directly and others were brought to our attention as a result of suggestions we sought from the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Democrats, the Australian Republican Movement and the organisation of Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy. We are confident that they are a fine group of Australians who have been selected on the basis of their interest in and capacity to discuss constitutional issues and their ability to represent young people.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Boswell for that important question. The government's response to the recommendations of the financial systems inquiry, I think it is true to say, have been widely praised and endorsed. This is not surprising because they are good reforms. They are good for competition in industry, good for customers and good for all Australians, especially those in rural and regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reforms will deliver billions of dollars of benefits for Australian businesses and consumers. The reforms are also built on the advantages of the existing arrangements, in preserving their basic goals of safety and stability. They help Australian consumers and businesses enjoy the benefits of new technologies and world best practice in the financial system and maximise the international competitiveness of our financial services industry. These benefits and others will flow to all Australians, including those in small business and those in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As many honourable senators will know, the government supports Credit Care, an initiative to help establish credit unions in small towns where banks do not operate. A particularly pleasing aspect of the reforms to the payments system is that they will improve the capacity of credit unions and building societies to provide a full range of services to their customers. More intense competition between different financial institutions will benefit people throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have mentioned, the response to our initiatives has been overwhelmingly positive. Let me go through some of the responses that have already come to the government's attention. The Credit Union Services Corporation said, `The credit unions applaud the Wallis reforms. Credit unions are primed to lead a new wave of competition against the banks in the nation's $250 billion personal finance sector.' Aussie Home Loans, which is well known to senators in this chamber, has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> welcomed the government's response to the Wallis inquiry and will now investigate expansion into a number of new financial services activities, including the taking of deposits. The ANZ Banking Group said it praised the federal government's response to the Wallis inquiry recommendations, in particular the establishment of a new payments system to control risk in the financial system. Westpac said that the federal government's response represented `a bold set of policy decisions which potentially places Australia at the leading edge of change.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Life Insurance and Superannuation Association&mdash;better known to many as LISA&mdash;with a number of other groups, including the Investment Funds Association, strongly supports the government's response to the financial systems inquiry. The Australian Association of Permanent Building Societies said, `The building society industry is very positive about the Treasurer's announcement implementing the Wallis report.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And so it goes on, with responses from the National Australia Bank, the Commonwealth Bank and last&mdash;but not entirely least&mdash;from Senator Sherry. Senator Sherry supports in principle the basic regulatory thrust of Wallis, but he did say, `We reserve our right to scrutinise the detail.' And, I have to say, that is as about as good as it ever gets from Senator Sherry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Senator Alston. Will the minister advise the Senate of the outcome of the Australian National sale process? How will the sale revitalise the Australian rail industry and ensure long-term jobs, especially in regional Australia, and end the massive subsidy which Labor poured in to an inefficient rail business which had no hope of breaking even? What has been the response from interested parties regarding the announcement of the sale?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6296" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very important and historic event that we celebrate with the successful sale of AN, as announced by the minister last week. As Senator Calvert has suggested, it will completely revitalise the rail industry and provide for long-term jobs across Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three components. The Great Southern Railway Consortium, which purchased AN's passenger business, has given a commitment to no ongoing taxpayer subsidies, as have the other two consortia. It has also given a commitment that existing passenger services will not only be maintained but refurbished, upgraded and expanded. There is a $14.3 million capital investment program over six years, which of course means more jobs for South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Genesee and Wyoming Consortium, which bought the South Australian freight and the Australian Transport Network, which purchased Tasrail, similarly have given commitments to upgrading and maintaining levels of employment. A total of $62 million in capital investment for freight in South Australia over a five-year period will clearly again mean more jobs for that state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that the sale price of $95 million, with the consortia contracted to a further high level of capital expenditure over the next four to six years, is a breathtakingly good result for South Australia and Tasmania, and for the rest of Australia. This is against the background of that lot opposing tooth and nail this whole proposal, despite the fact that you had the workers, you had the unions, you had the people of South Australia and you 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> had the media in that state, and I am sure in Tasmania, together with all of the parliamentary leaders of that state, making it abundantly clear that this is what they wanted. But, no, all we got was this churlish negativism which characterises Labor's approach to almost every issue&mdash;in other words, utterly opportunistic, trying to find fault, carping with every proposal that is put up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The height of hypocrisy of course was that Lindsay Tanner came out and said, `Ninety-five million dollars is not enough. We could have got more.' They did not suggest we could have got two bob for it when we were proposing to sell it in the first instance. All they were doing was opposing it. It is a great result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fascinating to find that Senator Woodley seems to have come on board the train at the last minute, because I know he had some great wobbles in the course of the committee hearings and clearly was expressing very serious concerns about the whole concept. But ultimately, of course, he came on board and he told ABC radio, `I've got to say I'm really pleased; I mean, I'm really thrilled about it actually.' All I can say is that, with his newfound conversion to privatisation, it is a pity that he was not the Democrats' spokesman for telecommunications. We could have saved ourselves a lot of trouble. We could have had you on that committee inquiry. You had an open mind, which clearly others did not have, and we might have got there a lot quicker than we did. But, nonetheless, despite the Democrats' and Labor's best endeavours, we got there on that one and we got there on this one, and we are delighted to have that endorsement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the best endorsement of all is from Rex Phillips, the Public Transport Union state secretary in South Australia. He said, `Trade union officials don't usually praise Liberal politicians. I might even vote Liberal at the next election.' I hasten to add that, with Senator Schacht on the Senate ticket, he probably does not have much choice. But, nonetheless, it gives you a pretty good indication of how out of touch this lot really are and what a great result this has been for South Australia, Tasmania and the rest of the

In fact, the vice&hyphen;chancellor at the university has withdrawn 720 publicly funded places and will lose 1,100 places to federal funding cuts. Many of these places are being offset by up-front fee paying students. The dean has said: `We'd be crazy not to replace government places with full fee places.' Does the minister agree that universities faced with these cuts to operating grants would be crazy not to replace HECS places with full fee paying places?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Stott Despoja for yet again giving me the opportunity to make the government's position clear on a number of matters, not the least of which is the introduction of the option for universities to charge full up-front fees next year. Senator, you were for a limited period of time at the estimates committee hearings and I am sure you have had the opportunity to go through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> s subsequent to that. You will understand that, because there is the slightest suggestion from Monash that they could in one way or another rejig their figures to maximise their opportunities for fee paying students over and above the limitations that parliament agreed to, we would be amending the regulations that were to cover that area to make it absolutely certain they would not be able to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, you did not like the decision, but this parliament decided that universities would have the option, once they had filled their government funded places, of selling additional places, with two requirements on that. Firstly, they could not exceed 25 per cent and, secondly, they must have filled the government funded places in each course before they could sell places. If you have further statements made by Monash subsequent to those that were raised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, I would be very happy to have a look at them. I am absolutely predetermined on a course to ensure that universities in no way subvert the government's intention in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the changes that we have made will in fact do that: they will ensure that universities follow the government's intention. But, if you have some views subsequent to my having made that clear, I will have another look. I do not accept for one minute, Senator, that I think anything further needs to be done but, if you think something further needs to be done, then by all means come around and make it clear what you think ought to be done, because we are determined to ensure that the government's and parliament's intention is not subverted in any way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the question of cuts. You, Senator, are among the people who have tried 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6300"> to convince existing and potential students that universities have suffered real cuts. I do not think you were at the estimates hearing, Senator, when we demonstrated by way of graph the changes. Senator, I notice you are ducking your head. You are slightly embarrassed that some people on the estimates committee were so stupid that words would not do&mdash;we had to show them a picture. And we showed them a picture. What did the picture show, Senator? It showed what these people opposite, the guilty party, did to funding per student when they got into government in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding per student is one of the indicators of quality. That is what gives a university the capacity to employ staff and buy equipment and all the sorts of gear that are required. And what did they do to funding per student? They cut it from $12,000 and shoved it down to under $11,000 and then slowly brought it back up again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have the changes we have made done to funding per student? They have kept it at or above 1996 levels. Funding per student in the next four years under the coalition government is higher than in any of the previous four years under the guilty party's government. So do not come in here to try to misrepresent what we have done with universities. Universities have more money this year than they had last year&mdash;and you know that. They had their plans for future money cut&mdash;not their actual money this year. They have more money this year than they had last year and you would do well to build your reputation by starting to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth about these things.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Monday this week Senator Allison asked Senator Alston whether he was aware that a clause in the IT outsourcing specification for the Australian Custodies Service insisted that PC suppliers could only be used if they currently shipped 250,000 Pcs per year. Senator Allison asked Senator Alston if he was aware that Australia's largest PC supplier shipped less than a third of that number and would, like all other Australian suppliers, be excluded from tendering.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response Senator Alston told Senator Allison that the Customs Request for Tender did not preclude small suppliers from bidding for the provision of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6301"> Pcs. However, Senator Alston emphasised that the Government would require acceptable standards to be maintained during the life of any contract.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a subsequent question yesterday, Senator Allison said that the provision to allow smaller suppliers to offer Pcs `as specifically not available to Ipex, our largest PC supplier'. She said that while a contract manager could be appointed to vary the requirement for 250,000 Pcs per annum, in this case no such arrangement had been made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She went on to say that `multi-national outsourcing vendors have already been told by the Customs Service that their bids would not be accepted using Australian suppliers'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That latter assertion is not correct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Customs Service is currently evaluating tenders from three potential prime contractors and all three contractors have confirmed in writing today that they have received no such instruction from the Customs Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the rest of Senator Allison's question, she either misunderstands the Customs Information Technology Outsourcing contract, or has misread a letter from the Customs Project Manager to Ipex.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PC suppliers, including Ipex, were not invited, nor were they eligible, to bid to be prime contractors for the Customs IT outsourcing. Only those vendors on the PE68 Common User Contract who had the capacity to manage the full range of Customs IT were invited to bid for the total project on a prime contract basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Equipment suppliers (including PC suppliers), software suppliers and other service provides will be involved in the project as sub-contractors to the prime contractor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Customs tender (RFT) and the published evaluation criteria emphasised the importance of involving Australian industry and small to medium enterprises. All three vendors under consideration have involved Australian companies either as subcontractors or as partners or have tendered Australian made equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Customs outsourcing tender has not yet been decided nor any contract let. No decision has been taken on the supply of a specific PC under the outsourcing contract.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contract, when awarded will not specify a particular brand of PC, rather it will specify criteria consistent with the RFT. The prime contractor win be free at any time during the contract to supply equipment meeting Tier 1 or Tier 2 criteria or to offer any other equipment, including Ipex, for Customs approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Project Manager for the Customs tender wrote to Ipex on 30 July stating, inter alia, that:

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`in the interest of accuracy, I need to remind you that I did not confirm the acceptability (or otherwise) of your equipment for the ACS'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Box was simply making it clear to IPEX that he had not approved them as a supplier at this stage&mdash;indeed it would be premature to do so before the RFT was evaluated and a prime contractor selected.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also you are frustrated because I think you did expect us to stack it, because that is the way you would have behaved. If you were in government, you would have appointed 36 republicans, would you not? That is what you would have done and you are absolutely stunned when we produced the list and you could not believe it. It was actually a fair list; it was actually fair and balanced. You could not believe that there were so many republicans appointed to the list and that in fact a minority of these delegates are supporters of the status quo. I have friends on this side who are constitutional monarchists who are annoyed with me because there is not a majority of people in this list who are constitutional monarchists. At the most there are about 11 or 12 out of the 36 who are known supporters of the status quo. We did not hear a peep out of you for three days because you were so stunned. We did not hear a squeak out of them for three days, because they were stunned that the list was so fair and balanced.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is news to me that by alluding to someone's Liberal Party connections you defame them, but that is an interesting interpretation from Senator Minchin. Let us go to Senator Hill's answer when he said this parliament was represented in proportion to the numbers. Of course it is not. There is just a slight stacking of the deck, where the Labor Party gets one delegate for every 13 members of federal parliament, the coalition gets one delegate for every 11, the independents get one delegate for every nine and the Democrats get one for every seven. It is just that subtle sort of rorting that the Liberal Party is good at.It is the same as when they came to do the staff allocation. When the quota came to 61.95 guess what? They rounded it down to 61. Typical of the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not care whether they have stacked out the convention with their 36; I do not care whether they have put 36 monarchists there. It is the deception that irritates me and the sort of message that they put out that most of these people are agnostics and do not have political connections, when in actual fact we know they are mostly from the right wing of the Liberal Party. No-one is saying they all are, but most of them are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I drew attention to Dr Craven because any Victorian will know that for five years every Saturday we got the most obsequious paeans to the Liberal Party you have ever seen in your life. It was grovelling support of Liberal Party and every week critical of the Labor Party. Not one article over five years ever supported a Labor Party position. Yet he tries 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6306"> to get in and say, `I am actually pretty neutral in this', when we know he is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of all the gin joints, of all the law firms around the country, of the 40,000 law firms around the country it just so happens that a representative of one gets chosen that happened to be the one that used to employ John Howard when he was on the backbench over there and pay him large sums of money to be their industrial relations consultant. Of all those 40,000 they just happened to pick an employee of that one firm to be represented at the convention. When they come to chose the young Queenslander, as Mr Bob Tucker indicated, they had to pick a branch stacker and rorter from Queensland to come down and attend the convention. Of all the Young Liberals in Queensland, they had to pick one of three that had been reprimanded by the Queensland president.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that there are distinguished Australians here; we acknowledge that. But you made sure that the vice-regal ones, like Mr McGarvie and Mr Hayden, had made apostate statements on the republic in the past. Of course, you chose those particular ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if ever you have seen misleading figures, they were cited by Senator Hill here today. He said, `Well, there's 52 per cent in support of the republic, there's 48 per cent opposed'&mdash;and then in a very low voice&mdash;`or undecided.' Why did he not give the accurate figures: 52, 26, 22? That leaves a much bigger margin between the `in favours' and those against. That was another little distortion snuck it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But why should we be surprised at Senator Hill's answer today? He would not know. He has never been as sharp and as fast on these sorts of stacking methods as the person sitting over here who was the last contributor. He is a well-known rorter in the Liberal Party in South Australia&mdash;well known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the man who mucked up the Ferris affair; he put someone on his staff so that she had to resign and then recontest the Senate position at great expense. He is the person who helped put the contract over to DDB Needham for the Liberal Party's advertising mates. He is the person who time and time again gets work for Burson-Marstellar, an

He is the person who helped rig the Australian Electoral Commission appointments in the last few months&mdash;and they will not produce any of the documents because they will show exactly what the recommendations were and what they were not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, here is the individual who rushes around Australia, organising the New South Wales branch of the uglies, to defeat other colleagues in this particular chamber, without telling his boss, John Howard&mdash;and John Howard having to rebuke him for it. He has been able to stack the deck, just to give them a bit more of an edge. And naive sort of boobies from Boothby just do not understand what is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately, with this sort of stack out of right wing employees, he is not dudding us at all. He is not dudding the Labor Party. He is dudding his own side. All they have tried to do is just get an edge. They have not given us 36 monarchists. They have just made sure that at every stage of the process they will have that little edge in the hope that they can have a hung convention.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it was last Wednesday or Thursday that we had Senator Schacht taking note of an answer, after he had been absolutely slaughtered by Senator Alston.

The most important thing on the agenda of the opposition has nothing to do with the Wallis report, neither does it have anything to do with any of the other major statements that have been made this week. The only thing we find the opposition wanting to take note of today is the so-called stacking of appointments of delegates to the constitutional convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What of the very people who are accusing us of stacking? Senator Ray, I notice that Senator Carr has been very quiet; those professional stackers, like Senator Carr and you, probably think they can recognise when stacking is being done when, in fact, all you have done is raise the issue of a young chap 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6307"> from Queensland who happened to have been reprimanded for alleged rorting. There are other people on your front bench, and one in particular, who would not like to start bringing their past into things either. But let me say: when it comes to stacking branches and when it comes to rorting the system, I guess that you would be the first ones to try to recognise it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I need to make is that you criticise people because they have some Liberal Party affiliation or connection. The difference between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party is that, on your side of the chamber, everybody is afraid to have any other point of view than a republican one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this side of the chamber, we have people with a variety of views. You conveniently call them monarchists or republicans. There just happen to be a lot of people on this side of the chamber who support the current constitution. That is why we are having a constitutional convention. On this side of the chamber, amongst the Liberal Party and the National Party, there are people who have a variety of views on the republic and whether we should move that way. If somebody just happens to have Liberal Party connections, you can say all you like, but that does not necessarily mean that they support a monarchy, or the republic, or any other position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then you go on to pick out various people who are mentioned in this list with their brief biographies. You criticise the fact that, when these announcements are made, there is only a brief description given of their profession, why they have been appointed or where they have come from. Senator Ray criticised Professor Greg Craven, but I do not see his description being given in full anywhere. We go to some of the other people in here&mdash;for instance, the former Chairman of ATSIC, Lois O'Donoghue. After describing the things that she has done, it does not then go on to say that she is an ardent republican, or that she has been supportive of that cause for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other things going to this issue. When you were talking about young people, you did not bother to say that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Mr Moller from Tasmania is a very enthusiastic ALP supporter. That is why, when these decisions were made to appoint people, much care was taken to see that there was a balance. All that you have done is attempted to pick just one or two people who happen to be on the list for a variety of reasons&mdash;one of which being to try to give that balance which we promised there would be with the appointed delegates&mdash;and conveniently chosen to ignore people who are on that appointed list of delegates who have a totally different point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Deputy President, it is not easy to pick 36 people when you have a number of nominations from all over of the place. As mentioned by Senator Minchin, one of the young people was nominated by the Democrats, although other people tend to claim that they all nominate them&mdash;but there are a lot of nominations made by a lot of people. In fact, of those who were appointed, many were nominated by a vast number of people; not just one or two. Anyone was invited to nominate people. From the large number of people who were nominated, it was a very difficult decision to come down to a balanced list of 36 people who represent all the points of view across the broad spectrum of people in Australia&mdash;both young and old, both Aboriginal and European, some being people who have come to Australia as migrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So let me say that this is a very well balanced list. The government can be proud that they have put together a list with so much balance.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me just start with that last point that Senator Ferguson made: it is `a very balanced list'. From the lips of his parliamentary secretary, Senator Minchin, the previous speaker on his side of the chamber, the balance is 52 per cent pro&hyphen;monarchy, 28 per cent pro&hyphen;republican and 20 per cent undecided. Do you know what happens with undecideds? Senator Minchin would know. You split them up. And if you split them up, it ends up 62 per cent to 38 per cent. That is a balance for you, Senator Ferguson? In a preselection ballot I would not like to be facing a balance such as that. But that is your

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a really desperate effort we have seen here today from Senator Hill sitting over there representing the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and, indeed, from Senator Minchin, the chief adviser to the Prime Minister on this particular matter. I asked a very direct and very simple question of Senator Hill; not regarding the individual who was appointed&mdash;not regarding her at all, and I do believe I have met her on one occasion. I did not reflect on her in any way, shape or form. I have got a copy here of the question that I read, and I was very careful how I read it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did Senator Hill do? Senator Hill endeavoured to turn it round so that I was attacking the individual. I was not. I do not generally do things like that. I do not need to do things like that. What I was drawing attention to&mdash;in asking the Minister representing the Prime Minister this question&mdash;was whether or not he, as Prime Minister, was paying off this legal firm which had been of great benefit to him in previous years when he was on the opposition benches and not getting as much money in his salary as he is now. I was asking: was there a pay&hyphen;off? What did Senator Hill reply to that question? I ask you, Senator Calvert. You search the record. You will not find it in the answer, because he evaded the question.</PARA>

Senator McKiernan from Western Australia, and Senator Ray, made the mistake of referring to a Western Australian appointee&mdash;a female who happens to be the managing partner of Clayton Utz or `Uts', depending on where you come from. Senator Ray asked us why, out of the 20,000 legal firms in Australia, we chose this particular firm. They have not even read the whole list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the appointees is Mary Imlach from Tasmania, a partner in the firm of Jennings, Elliott. Senator O'Brien, as a former President of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council, would be well aware that that firm does a lot of trade union work in the workers compensation area. But you swept that under the carpet&mdash;you do not want to mention that. But having said that to the Senate, let me say that Mary Imlach is a woman of integrity, as is that law firm, and I do not begrudge the fact that Senator Minchin submitted her name, being associated with that legal firm that is involved in looking after a lot of trade unions. Mary Imlach will do Tasmania and Australia proud at the Constitutional Convention, as I am sure Julie Bishop will as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where the senators opposite have descended into this guttersniping of the personalities, they could not even read the list properly. They said there was not enough information about the people's backgrounds.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I wish to make a brief statement in relation to the matter I raised with Senator Vanstone after question time today. After question time I raised the issue that, during the Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee's consideration of estimates on 19 August of this year, Senator Vanstone had given a commitment to Senator O'Brien in relation to the South Pacific Cruise Lines Ltd issue&mdash;which has been a matter of some interest and a series of questions at both the Senate legislation committee and two question times in the Senate chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone gave a commitment to Senator O'Brien on 19 August that she would provide the senator with more considered views within a couple of weeks, with a range of answers to questions that had, effectively, been placed on notice. Without wanting to place words in the minister's mouth, the spirit of what Senator Vanstone offered was a report to the Senate on this issue. I could have raised this matter yesterday because it did occur on Tuesday, 19 August, but I thought it was appropriate to raise it today, to allow the minister to provide information to the Senate on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do point out that this is a matter of some significance. It involves some $2.8 million of public money. There has already been a payment of some $2.2 million to a company. That has been confirmed by both the minister and officers of her department. There is a range of outstanding issues which I do not want to labour during this very brief contribution, but I think it is appropriate that the minister provide that information to the Senate now, because it is an issue of great concern to the opposition and to opposition senators and it is an issue which has had quite a significant airing in other jurisdictions&mdash;in other parliaments&mdash;and has also been the subject of commentary in the media. I believe it is appropriate that the minister now have an opportunity to respond in full to those concerns, because of their significance both to the parliament and in the public mind.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;To put this matter in context, I think it is appropriate to read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  the exchange we had at the estimates committee hearing. Before doing that, I will indicate a number of things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since I first heard of potential problems with the South Pacific Cruise Line contract and the department's activities in that respect, it has always been my view that the amount of money involved was substantial, that it did need to be watched carefully, that it was unusual, to say the very least, and that it would require both the fullest reporting and the most appropriate reporting, not necessarily to the estimates committee itself but to parliament&mdash;maybe through the estimates committee or otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator O'Brien did ask a number of questions about that. On Tuesday he put this question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given what has come before the committee today in relation to the South Pacific Cruise Lines contract, has the minister a view as to the appropriateness of the actions of the department in relation to entering into the contract with South Pacific Cruise Lines?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was the question I was asked: what was my view about the department entering into a contract with South Pacific Cruise Lines? My response was this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator, I have some concerns about the contract as it stands, but I think I need some more advice before I can make a conclusion as to the appropriateness or otherwise of how we ended up being in that position. It is a matter of concern&mdash;but just give me one second, if you would not mind.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And, if <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  was a video, that would show me turning to a deputy secretary and consulting him about how long it might take to get to the bottom of this. I then came back and continued with the answer:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator, within a couple of weeks I could provide you with more considered views.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I could go on, but I could, equally, put a full stop there and make the point that what I said was, `I could come back within a couple of weeks and give you more considered views.' We can argue about the strength of that as an

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to continue, Madam Deputy President, but I am not happy to continue if I am continually interrupted. I ask for the protection of the chair in this matter. Senator Faulkner has raised a serious matter. He, presumably, is interested in it. There are other opportunities for other senators to contribute if they want. Nonetheless, I  went on and said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just to give you an indication of the information that I want&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">not that which I am being pressed for by the estimates committee but what I want to get on this matter&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been advised that up until very near to the signing of the contract, the department was negotiating with and believed it was going to make a contract with William Angliss. Presumably, you would not find that so exceptional because that would be a contract with the training agency to provide certain training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was very near to the signing of that, I am advised, that William Angliss proposed the substitution of the other party&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, for your benefit, Madam Deputy President, South Pacific Cruise Lines&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to be the party with whom we contracted. There is no doubt we agreed to do that, but it was not a case of someone coming in off the street. Sometimes one might gather that by the references to a former bankrupt being a director. It was not the case that someone came in off the street and said, `I've got a good idea,' and the department just loosely entered into a very expensive contract. But I do need to get the dates and a better outline of it before I can make any further remarks&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which is in itself a qualification&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not an ideal situation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and I do not resile from that at all; it is not&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but it may, in fact, work&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am still in a position to express that view&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not want to prejudge it in any way whatsoever. But it is a situation which causes concern.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator O'Brien then says that it may work and he outlines some of his concerns which relate to the cost of training. He rightly identified that this does seem to be an unusually high cost per person of training. I do not think I need to go into the particular words there except to interpose where he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hear what you say and I look forward to the detail about entering into this contract if, indeed, the negotiations have gone right up to the point of signing and then the names have basically changed as to who the&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and then I say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The parties have changed, yes. I will get all that information and I will come back to you with it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I stand by that. I will, but I do not want to come back without having the full information on this. I have some but not enough. I am not yet satisfied that I can adequately and properly report to Senator O'Brien, the Senate or the estimates committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is of any satisfaction, which I doubt that it is&mdash;not to me but to other senators&mdash;I had a discussion with the secretary to my department on Thursday last week and indicated my dissatisfaction with the flow of information to me about this matter and that it should be perfectly clear from this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that I had a very strong interest in it and that I wanted to get to the bottom of it. My office was subsequently given a number of cut&hyphen;off points for when the matter would be reported on to me, which were not all met but nonetheless I have received a preliminary report indicating that there are more matters that need to be resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have subsequently written to the secretary and indicated that I want a date by which the secretary can say these matters are resolved as far as the department can do that, and give me that information, and I will then conclude whether that is the end of the matter or not. Senator Faulkner, Senator O'Brien, Senator Evans&mdash;he had some interest in this; I am not sure whether he asked me questions about this matter, but he was certainly there when it was raised&mdash;and others can be absolutely confi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6313"> dent that when I have all the information they will have every piece of it they need to make a proper assessment of what happened&mdash;absolutely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to making that absolute commitment, I just point out that it is not as simple as Senator Faulkner indicates. I did say I could come back&mdash;I point out that I did not say that I would, but my clear intention was that I would&mdash;but indicated subsequent to that that I needed to get further information before I could.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me add, though, that I am advised that the training in relation to hospitality has been completed. I understand William Angliss believes that all of the trainees who completed their training&mdash;there were a few dropouts&mdash;are now in a position to compete for jobs in the tourism industry around the Gold Coast et cetera and that there is now land based training in relation to safety. The matter of sea based training I think is a matter that I cannot usefully comment on without having more information in front of me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot usefully comment on the cost per person of the training at the moment other than to say that I can agree with Senator O'Brien. The cost seems to me to be exceptionally high, but I say that almost intuitively in that I cannot tell you I have got out every training contract, had a look and satisfied myself that there are not any others as high. But it does seem a very large amount of money on a per week basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think my concerns are basically the same as Senator O'Brien's. I indicated to him I wanted a chronology of how this happened, of how we suddenly ended up negotiating a contract with one party and in fact signing with another&mdash;another that you could not, as I understand it, argue had a long and reliable background but was seeking to go into a new and exciting venture in tourism. I think everyone is entitled to at least a chronology of how we ended up in that position and certainly an explanation vis-a-vis the cost. They are Senator O'Brien's interests, as outlined to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have subsequent interests, and I would imagine Senator O'Brien and any member of the estimates committee would have them, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and they relate to accountability for how it happened and how quickly or slowly information comes forward from people involved not only to me but even to the head of my department and to the departmental secretaries. I am interested in how easy it is for them to get the relevant information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect this matter may be an interesting case study in a number of respects, but I can only repeat for you, Senator Faulkner: as soon as I have information that I think I can rely on and I am able to say to you that it is all the information you need to make a judgment, I will most certainly bring it forward.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The reason I sought leave to make a statement on this matter is to hopefully obviate the need for us to have a suspension of standing orders and deal with this in a more adversarial way. I am hopeful that we can sort this out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of issues that arise from the contribution that Senator Vanstone has just made. Senator Vanstone would recall that in the Senate chamber in question time on Wednesday last week Senator O'Brien asked her a question in relation to that further expenditure of moneys to this particular company in relation to this training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I do think would have been appropriate, Minister, in these circumstances is for the Senate to have been provided before today, but certainly by today, with an answer to that question. I do not believe that that is a matter that would require an enormous amount of effort on the part of your department and, given the sensitivity and the significance of the question that Senator O'Brien has asked of you, I believe the Senate is entitled to a quick response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to you on that particular point that you might consider providing the information in relation to that aspect of Senator O'Brien's questioning which you took on notice on 27 August. You indicated at that time that you would come back with a chronology of events; you acknowledged that in your earlier contribution. You then said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6314">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there have been subsequent events to that that I do not now know about, I will certainly add that to the explanation I give you.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I appreciate that you made that point but I do think, in relation to this particular matter, that that is an essential piece of information going to the expenditure of public moneys and the Senate is entitled to an early response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also believe the Senate would need some understanding from the responsible minister as to when this information could be provided to either the Senate or to the relevant legislation committee dealing with estimates for the minister's department. The minister, in her earlier contribution, has not given any indication to the Senate of what time frame she has in mind and I think, in making an assessment of this as far as the opposition is concerned, it is reasonable for me to request the minister to make a clear and categorical statement in relation to that today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Senator Vanstone indicated that within a couple of weeks she could provide us with more considered views, the opposition took what she said at face value. It is possible, it does happen at times, that material is harder to bring together than one could imagine from the discomfort of the opposition benches. I also say very clearly that, regularly, much greater demands were put upon the then Labor administration in this chamber. I think there is a rather generous acceptance on the part of opposition senators in relation to the commitment and the time frame that was given here. I think Senator Vanstone would have to acknowledge that that has been the case. At a minimum, I think we need to understand today precisely what the minister has in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue I would canvass with the minister and ask for a response on&mdash;so we can perhaps save a little time at a later stage&mdash;is the issue of the possible reconvening of the Senate estimates committee on this issue. Senator Vanstone may indicate to us that this information will be able to be made available before the end of this sitting period; that is, some time within the next 28 hours. I do not know the answer to that question. I would like to hear from Senator Vanstone what the answer is.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is not the case, Senator Vanstone, then I would put to you very seriously that, at a mutually agreed time during the two&hyphen;week break between the next sittings of the parliament, at a minimum it would be appropriate, in my view, for an agreement that the Senate estimates committee reconvene and deal with this matter. If that does not happen it would be well over a month before the information would be made available to the Senate; and that simply is not acceptable. I hope, given the apparent seriousness of the issues that have been raised, the minister shares my concern in relation to accountability on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put as clearly as I can, and with as much goodwill as I can muster, those three points to Senator Vanstone. Before we move to some sort of more adversarial approach on this matter in the chamber today, I ask the minister to respond to those specific matters that I have raised. Depending on the nature of those responses, we might be able to deal with this in a way that suits all interested parties in the chamber&mdash;both the opposition and the government.</PARA></SPEECH>

I have not yet got enough information before me with respect to the cost of training to absolutely satisfy myself, for example, that there are not some travel costs built into the cost of training. So when the senator asserts that we, the department, are flying people to wherever for sea&hyphen;based training, I think I can say, but I will check that as well, that my natural inclination on the basis of the information I have is that we, DEETYA, are not.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement advises that these costs may be reimbursed, but that where more than one agent is engaged reimbursement is limited to the costs charged by the agent who actually sells the home. The Committee suggests, however, that there may be circumstances where this provision could operate unfairly if, for instance, an agent is engaged to sell a home and, for some reason, such as the death or bankruptcy of the agent or if the agent loses his or her licence, the member has to employ another agent to make the sale.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator O'Chee</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer again to your letter of 7 May 1997 about Defence Determination 1997/16.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my interim reply of 27 May, I indicated that the Department of Industrial Relations was consulting the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and other appropriate organisations to obtain background information relevant to your request for advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It transpires that no case of the kind you portray has ever arisen in the 17-year history of the Home Purchase and Sale Expenses Allowance (HPSEA) scheme. Moreover, the negligible risk could be minimised if members exercised reasonable care and responsibility in selling their home. Even if such circumstances did arise, it is likely that a member could reach a mutually acceptable outcome with the agent who effected the sale. The terms of contract between the member and an agent who was unable to effect a sale could also be relevant. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These points lead me to the view that there is no practical prospect of a member's rights being adversely affected by the Determination. I am therefore not persuaded that inclusion of a specific discretion to admit the cost of advertising a home with more than one agent could be justified in terms of the additional burden of complication (and thence inefficiency) for ADF personnel management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In matters of this kind, attempts to cover the full range of eventualities (however remote) need to be moderated with regard to the wider benefits of keeping the rules simple and the indirect administrative costs within bounds. In the past, public sector personnel legislation has generally tended towards over-prescription, and this has directly contributed to under-achievement. In my preface to the discussion paper `Towards a best practice Australian Public Service', I identified "the complex array of outdated, rigid and cumbersome regulations" as a key performance inhibitor. I am reluctant to add to any such difficulties that the ADF may be facing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, the principal determination on HPSEA does contain a general discretion authorising the Chief of the Defence Force to approve payment of the allowance in circumstances not otherwise provided for. I attach a copy of this provision for your Committee's information. The power has existed for some years and because of its prescriptive wording, it is not entirely clear that it would be flexible enough to meet the contingencies you envisage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to put this beyond doubt, the discretion has been modernised in a form recently developed by the Office of Legislative Drafting for use as a general discretion in Defence determinations. At the same time, this step advances my portfolio's agenda of simplifying public sector personnel legislation wherever possible. A copy of the amending determination is also attached.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Quarantine (General) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1997 No 85, which 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> introduce a system of infringement notices for minor quarantine offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 85 defines an infringement notice offence to mean a contravention of a minor nature. There is no further indication of what is minor, which would thus appear to be left to the discretion of the quarantine officer. The Committee accepts that it may be difficult to define the circumstances which are to be regarded as minor in the context of the Regulations. However, your advice would be appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There appear to be no AAT review provisions relating to the decision of an officer under rr.86 (serving an infringement notice), 88(b) (refusing to withdraw an infringement notice) or 90 (allowing a further period for paying the prescribed penalty). The Committee would appreciate your advice on whether independent review of these decisions is available and, if not, of the reasons for this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 89 sets out the matters which must be included in infringement notices but does not require the infringement notice to include the beneficial consequences of a person paying the administrative penalty. The Committee considers that it would be appropriate to amend the Regulations to require notice of these to be given.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 89(1)(e) provides that if a person on whom an infringement notice is served does not wish the matter to be dealt with by a court then the person must pay the penalty before leaving the clearance area. Regulation 90, however, provides that a quarantine officer may allow a further period for payment. There is no requirement that notice of the advantageous provisions of r.90 be included in r.89 notices and the Committee considers that this should be done. In any event, the Committee considers that the Regulations would be more fair if they provided as of right for a period of 28 days within which payment may be made. Similar provisions are included in other instruments providing for administrative penalties, such as the recent Airports (Environment Protection) Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement is uninformative and, in some cases, slightly misleading. For instance, `Regulation 87 requires the person being served with an infringement notice to provide their name and address and to show evidence of the person's identity'. In fact, r.87 merely confers a discretion on a quarantine officer to require a person to give their name and address and to prove identity.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator O'Chee</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 25 June 1997 in which you raised some issues about the proposed introduction of a system of infringement notices for minor quarantine offences at airports by way of the Quarantine (General) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1997 No. 85 which was tabled on 13 May 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the Amendment was, by necessity, general in nature and therefore it may further your understanding of the amendment if I provide some more detail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a first step the following additional background on the environment in which the proposed Quarantine Infringement Notices (QIN) system will operate may be of assistance. I will then address the specific issues you have raised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you will know the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) provides quarantine clearance of aircraft and their passengers arriving from overseas. This year about eight million tourists and returning Australians are expected to enter Australia through our international airport terminals and prior to arrival each passenger must complete a declaration about any items which may present a quarantine risk (foodstuffs, wooden items, plant and animal origin material etc). On arrival passengers then choose to leave the baggage hall either via the green exit channel if they believe they have nothing to declare or to present themselves at the red exit channel with items they wish to declare for examination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AQIS has been aware for some time from spot checks in green channels that some passengers deliberately do not declare items of quarantine concern for many reasons including getting out of the airport quickly or smuggling. Recent surveys of green channels at all international gateways have shown that a worryingly high average of 35 per cent of green channel passengers are carrying items which should have been declared. While this is of concern, what is more disturbing was the finding that six per cent were carrying items of major quarantine significance. In 1995/96 this meant that about 180,000 passengers entered Australia carrying items of such quarantine concern that, if they had been declared, they would have been seized and destroyed. I am sure you will agree that this situation is completely unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been a number of responses to this situation which have included additional quarantine 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> detector dog teams, the introduction of modern X-ray equipment at some airports and the development of an education campaign part of which is the introduction of a new in-flight video for airlines to inform incoming passengers of their obligations under the Quarantine Act 1908. The QIN system proposed in the Amendment is a part of this package of responses and is modelled on the system currently operated by the United States Department of Agriculture and was first suggested as being feasible and desirable in Australia by the National Audit Office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this point I must emphasise that Quarantine Officers already exercise considerable discretion and where it is clear that a passenger has made an honest mistake or genuinely does not understand his/her obligations, he/she will, as is the case now, be let off with an explanation and a warning. The QIN system targets the passenger who has deliberately made a false declaration simply to gain a quick exit from the airport or to avoid the risk of confiscation of goods such as a food delicacy or the cutting of a favourite plant. By far the greater number of passengers are in the former category.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of those in the latter category have in the past only been warned when detected because prosecution has been impractical. They will now be processed under the QIN system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also relevant to note that prior to the development of the system, AQIS research demonstrated that the vast majority of arriving passengers have access to sufficient funds to pay a fine of the magnitude proposed. This research verifies the US experience which also shows that almost all passengers served with a notice elect to pay by cash or credit card before leaving the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Initially, the QIN system is to be used at Australia's eight international air terminals although it is possible it will be extended to cruise ship passengers at some future time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is therefore against this background of an unacceptable problem with green channel passengers which has dictated a more assertive approach to quarantine border integrity at airports that I will address the specific concerns you have raised in your letter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is a "minor" breach of the Quarantine Act?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each month Quarantine Officers seize about 11,000 items of quarantine concern from arriving passengers but only an average of four to six of those seizures will result in prosecution action being commenced. This is because the majority of seized goods are in small quantities (say, single pieces of fruit or single wooden items) or the passenger is only visiting Australia for a few days. Prosecutions are only undertaken if the amount of quarantine material is large (eg, a suitcase full of raw meat or plants), of extremely high risk or where there has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6320"> been a deliberate attempt to smuggle and the passenger is in the country long enough to allow action through the courts to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed arrangements are designed to address those offenders who purposely fail to declare items or who make a false declaration (eg declaring a wooden item for inspection but carrying live plants secreted in a suitcase). These types of breaches are currently not pursued through the courts largely because of time constraints and a lesser quarantine risk with offenders only losing the items they were carrying rather than having to pay a more substantial penalty. It is believed that the institution of a genuine, well publicised, on-the-spot fine system will deter passengers from attempting such acts in future and will eventually lead to a significant decrease in the number of passengers making false declarations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Independent review of decisions made by a Quarantine Officer under Regulations 86,88b or 90.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An administrative review is not proposed as the QIN system is based on similar systems for dealing with minor transgressions (such as traffic infringements) where a person has the choice of either paying the on-the-spot penalty or, if they wish to challenge the matter, electing to have the matter heard by a court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inclusion of the beneficial consequences of a person paying the administrative penalty on the Infringement Notice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I agree with your suggestion. Both the Infringement Notice and an information sheet provided to QIN recipients will include information on the choices they have and the beneficial consequences of paying the administrative penalty before leaving the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allowing a further period to pay (r90) being included in the r89 Notices and providing a right to pay within 28 days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main reason behind allowing a Quarantine Officer to make a judgment about allowing further time to pay a QIN is if there is a genuine reason why the person cannot pay at the airport (no cash or credit cards or no relative or friend meeting them able or willing to pay). However, as mentioned, the US experience with its quarantine infringement notice system indicates that it is very unusual for a person not to have sufficient cash or a credit card to pay the penalty. Consequently, it is expected that extensions of time to pay will be very infrequent. The fact that Quarantine Officers have this discretion is printed on both the QIN and the information sheet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Including a right to pay within 28 days as a feature of the QIN system, as is the case with other schemes, is also viewed as impractical because of the peculiarities of the circumstances. If the offender is a returning Australian there is a good chance 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that they do not live in the city of arrival and there would be an unacceptable administrative burden on AQIS to follow up on offenders. More importantly, the green channel surveys showed that about half of potential offenders were short term visitors who were only in the city of arrival for two or three days and then either left the country or moved on to other areas of Australia. I am sure you will understand the administrative difficulty of following up on those visitors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The QIN system will only be implemented after extensive training of Quarantine Officers. This training will specifically emphasise the importance of fully informing alleged offenders of their choices to deal with the matter, and the implications of those choices. This will ensure the system is administered sensitively while still providing an effective method of dealing with those passengers who are found to be in clear breach of Australia's quarantine requirements while serving as a strong deterrent to other potential offenders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will appreciate that I am anxious to resolve these queries quickly and move on to implementing the QIN system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust this response has adequately addressed your queries. I would also like to offer the services of senior staff from the Quarantine and Exports Division of AQIS to brief you or your Committee on the special circumstances addressed by the QIN system. In this regard you should contact Mr Peter Buckland, National Manager, Border Programs on 06 2725365 (fax 06 2723276). Officers of that Branch would also like to offer you and your Committee an opportunity to observe quarantine processing of arriving international passengers at Sydney Airport so as to assist their understanding of the environment in which the proposed system will operate and to see at first hand the issues it will address.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On 23 August 1995, the following matter was referred to the Committee of Privileges:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> whether threats of legal proceedings were made against persons in respect of their provision of information to Senator O'Chee in relation to matters raised in the Senate by Senator O'Chee;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> whether a threat of legal proceedings was made against Senator O'Chee in respect of his activities as a Senator; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> whether contempts were committed in respect of those matters.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In giving precedence to the motion, the then President drew attention to the complexity of the issues involved in the reference. In particular, he drew attention to the:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . very significant question of whether actions taken against persons in respect of their provision of information to members of Parliament may constitute a contempt, in the words of section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, as conduct which "amounts, or is intended or likely to amount, to an improper interference with the free exercise by a House or a committee of its authority or functions, or with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as a member".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As the report indicates, in addressing this issue the committee also addressed other wide ranging issues, such as the right of a person to take legal action versus the duty of the Senate to protect the provision of information, sub judice questions, and the scope of section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987. In dealing with the questions, the committee sought its own advice and also received submissions from organisations such as the Queensland Law Society and the Law Council of Australia. Legal representations were also 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made on behalf of one of the persons involved in the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In taking into account the important principles raised in all submissions, the committee wishes particularly to emphasise the need to protect the integrity of parliamentary proceedings, a need that is directly analogous to protection of court proceedings, while accepting the necessity to ensure comity between the executive, legislative and judicial arms of governance, and the role of the courts in the interpretation of legislation relating to parliamentary privilege. This report reflects the committee's judgment as to its own capacities, and those of the Senate, to ensure that the necessary separation between legal and parliamentary functions has been preserved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The findings of the committee, one of which involves a finding of contempt against a person, are at page 25 of the report. The reasons for all findings are explained in the report. After I have completed these comments, I shall give the appropriate notice of motion to endorse the findings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee goes on to make some observations arising from its terms of reference. While there was some opportunity to address the question as to the extent to which protection should be extended to consultations between constituents and senators, and to information held by senators in the performance of their duties as senators, the committee decided not to do so at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is particularly because questions as to the scope of subsection 16(2) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 are currently before both the Queensland Supreme Court and the High Court of Australia&mdash;the first time that the extent of this element of privilege has been considered by the courts. Following the outcome of the two court cases, the committee undertakes to seek from the Senate a general reference to establish whether it should make any recommendations as to any further legislative initiatives which may be required to clarify the scope of parliamentary privilege.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before completing my remarks, I wish to pay a special tribute to three senators involved in this inquiry. Honourable senators will no doubt recall the untimely death of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6325"> Senator John Panizza, who was in Cairns to attend a public hearing of the committee. I wish again to place on record our appreciation of his commitment to the Senate and the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report also marks the last contribution of Senator Bruce Childs to the work of the committee. Senator Childs has been a member of the committee since 4 May 1983 and was its chairman for three years from 1984 to 1987. Although he was unable to attend the rescheduled public hearings of the committee, and therefore did not participate in subsequent deliberations on this reference, he was actively involved in the inquiry to that point, and indeed has been involved in all but six of the 67 reports which have been made by the committee since its establishment in 1966&mdash;a record which I am quite sure will never be broken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, on behalf of the committee, I wish to congratulate Senator Chris Ellison on his elevation, first to parliamentary secretary and then to Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs. Senator Ellison joined the committee four years ago as a newly elected senator and his contribution to its work has been invaluable. We are particularly grateful that he continued on as member of the committee to complete this inquiry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fifty&hyphen;eight years ago today, in 1939, Robert 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Menzies, Prime Minister, announced that Australia was again at war. United, Australians fought to protect our way of life and many gave their lives for a cause they believed in passionately. They fought under a national flag that was unveiled 96 years ago today at the Exhibition Buildings in Melbourne. While the flag identifies Australia, the values that our people fought for are far more symbolic of Australia: self&hyphen;reliance and courage, cocky confidence, matey egalitarianism that recognised the inherent worth of each individual, loyalty to one's nation, anti&hyphen;authoritarianism and a desire to take the mickey out of anyone pompous or conceited.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today these values are under attack and we may lose our national identity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do our young people have a sense of self&hyphen;worth and respect for the worth of others? Record levels of youth suicide suggest that they do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do our young people have confidence, cocky or otherwise? Survey after survey suggests that they do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do they have self&hyphen;reliance? The looking to others, whether it be government or business or  parents, to solve their problems, the country's problems or indeed the world's problems suggests they do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A veil of hopelessness has descended on many of our young people as they look to drugs to create the psychedelic illusion of a better place or merely to dull the senses so the monotony is more bearable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national effort and unity in the second world war was even more remarkable because it followed almost immediately after the Great Depression. Imagine our Australia today, after years of recession and economic challenges. Are the underlying values in our community and belief in ourselves strongly enough held to create the ethos to fight and to risk death to defend them, or are we too despondent to care?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the cause of this despair? I suggest we need to look back to the second world war and the creation of the welfare state. In trying to put in place a safety net, we have created a security blanket that many refuse to give up. We have bred an entitlement mentality; a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6326"> culture of dependency. This assertion of rights without countervailing responsibilities is destructive of cohesion in society and ultimately destroys the individual as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stand on this side of the chamber because I believe in Liberal philosophy that asserts the worth of each individual. Liberals declare a society is only just and licit if it respects the rights of each individual. What is sometimes forgotten is that we also require each individual to do the same, and in so doing create a society built on an intricate web of rights and responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this year's budget papers the amount allocated to social security and welfare expenditure is $52,316,000,000. This is by far the largest area of government expenditure, dwarfing spending on education at $11 billion and on health at $20 billion. In fact, it represents 40 per cent of the federal budget. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that there are 8,400,000 workers in Australia. The social welfare budget works out at about $6,200 a year per worker, or $120 a week per worker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It isn't possible to wave a magic wand and have social welfare expenditure disappear entirely. Lest anyone think I am some sort of anti&hyphen;welfare troglodyte, I do believe that there are a lot of Australians in genuine need and there is an obligation on all of us to provide for those who cannot take care of themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the safety net is not intended to be a comfortable hammock slung across two palm trees swaying gently in the breeze.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a national disgrace that some young people choose unemployment instead of working in what they see as menial jobs. In a recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> program, a young person said it was beneath him to work in McDonald's because he had a degree. Tell that to Charlie Bell, the managing director of McDonald's, who started in the job this person refuses to take. This culture of conceited superiority is really one of childish, selfish dependency on others. I would like to say to these young people and the other young people of Australia: the measure of your worth is not where you start in life, it's where you end.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My family encouraged me to be self&hyphen;reliant and independent. As a teenager I worked in a range of part&hyphen;time jobs, from packing boxes in a factory to selling eggs door to door. In all those jobs I never saw myself as a failure or a victim. I had belief in myself; I knew I would do better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1980s I worked for the community sector in the western suburbs of Melbourne&mdash;firstly, at my local church and then in an innovative employment skills and placement program. I worked with tens of thousands of people stripped of dignity because they were unemployed. They were angry at an education system that had not taught them to read and write properly, let alone prepare them with the skills required by employers. They were disheartened by the constant churning through vacuous training programs that were designed merely to keep them out of the unemployment statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern about the ease with which people get and retain social security payments is more about the impact it has on their sense of self-worth than the impact it has on our federal budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It used to be that the social welfare system provided temporary financial support while people got back on their feet. Now social welfare is a lifelong entitlement which traps people in poverty. Various benefits such as health care cards, transport concessions and family assistance mean that the real value of social welfare payments is far greater than an equivalent wage or salary. There is insufficient incentive to get part-time or temporary work because complex rules designed to prevent abuse act as barriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Institute of Chartered Accountants, for example, has found that a family wage earner on $30,000 a year is worse off than a family wage earner on $20,000 a year because of the top&hyphen;up of government benefits. What sort of mindless system do we have where a $10,000 a year pay increase makes you worse off? Yet this is the system after 13 years of Labor neglect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Monash University Centre for Population and Urban Research has disclosed that 32 per cent of all Australians are dependent in whole or in part on government welfare. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6327"> report saw the increasing dependency on welfare as a function of the restructuring of society and, in turn, higher income inequality. However, from my experience, I would argue that the relatively easy availability of welfare is a key factor in increased welfare dependency. When retrenched and given a choice of seeking less palatable work or going on welfare, the sums work out in favour of going on welfare. As we all know, with such rapid technological progress and workplace changes, once you are out of the work force your skills rapidly devalue and it is hard to get back in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Based on the Monash report, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> magazine, in its inimitable way, thundered in July:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where would you expect to find the nation's highest percentage of people on welfare? In some derelict mining community or rust&hyphen;bucket factory town? Try Tweed Heads, NSW, gateway to the beachy, boozy Gold Coast where 53.7% of the population exist on hand&hyphen;outs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">With statistics such as those reported in such a sensationalist fashion, it is no wonder the Australian tax paying public is getting jack of it. Clemenger Advertising reported last month on a study where 71 per cent said they were really concerned about dole bludgers and 70 per cent were really concerned about rich people getting welfare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a common thread in all this. As citizens we expect, and I believe rightly so, that those in receipt of welfare benefits do something to reduce or remove their reliance on welfare. The term `workfare' was coined in the United States to refer to the concept of reciprocal obligations associated with the receipt of welfare benefits. By and large, most countries have implemented schemes designed to coax people into work and away from benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the USA the Republican Congress and the Democratic President have put in place historic bipartisan reforms that set mandatory time limits on the receipt of most welfare benefits. Decades of social welfare orthodoxy that started with the New Deal in the Great Depression have been jettisoned. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine reports that the reforms are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> working and more people are finding work, many for the first time in their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More has to be done to encourage the positive aspects of self-reliance and entrepreneurialism. These are not new concepts. In 1945 Robert Menzies said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only from genuinely free, progressive, diligent and encouraged individuals can a really powerful nation be built.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Australia's longest serving Prime Minister identified the most important task this nation faces. It all begins with our children, our young people, our future. Parents, the education system and community leaders must take on the responsibility of inculcating our children with a sense of self&hyphen;worth and personal obligation to society. It is out of such values that optimism and commitment to self&hyphen;improvement are born.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week I took a group of year five and six students on a tour of Parliament House. I asked them what they saw as the major issues affecting Australia. They replied: drug use, youth suicide, homelessness and poverty. My eight&hyphen;year&hyphen;old nephew worries about environmental degradation. My niece of ten worries about escalating crime. What happened to the innocence of youth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our young people deserve hope. Modern Western society is regarded as the pinnacle of human development and progress. Surely we can do better than having 40 per cent of our children living in poverty and 30 per cent of our people dependent on government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we look to the third millennium, we can start admitting that the time of big government with handouts for all is over. We need to look to ourselves first and develop again those values that our diggers so epitomised when they made the ultimate sacrifice: self-reliance and courage, cocky confidence, matey egalitarianism that recognised the inherent worth of each individual, loyalty to one's nation, anti-authoritarianism and a desire to take the mickey out of anyone pompous or conceited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no greater challenge facing this country than the development and encouragement of our young people, to nurture these values in their lives. I commit myself, through 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6328"> the course of my parliamentary career and beyond, relentlessly to pursue this end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, it has been said that it is easy to look tall when you stand on the shoulders of giants. As I end my first speech in this house, I am reminded of the incredible debt of gratitude I owe to many people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst still at school, in 1975, I joined the Young Liberal Movement. I was fortunate to meet possibly the most outstanding political figure outside of this parliament in Michael Kroger. His guidance and support over two decades have been, as is everything about Michael, warm hearted and generous. Michael Kroger's term as President of the Victorian Division of the Liberal Party is legendary, and his enthusiasm and optimism transformed the party. Of course, back in the 1970s, Michael teamed with Peter Costello, who is clearly the most outstanding political figure of his generation in the parliament&mdash;and I am delighted that the Treasurer is here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In over two decades in the Liberal Party, I have met many dedicated and wonderful people who serve our country both inside and outside the parliament. One of them is here today: the Hon. Maree Lukins is the youngest female ever elected to the Victorian Upper House. She has paved the way for all young women who choose to combine motherhood with a parliamentary career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope one day that the advent of a new female MP will not be a moment for reflection on female representation in the parliament. However, while a female MP is no longer a novelty, we are still under&hyphen;represented. It took 17 parliaments before Dame Enid Lyons and Dame Dorothy Tangney were both sworn into parliament on 21 August 1943. In her maiden speech Dame Enid said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe, very sincerely, that any woman entering the public arena must be prepared to work as men work; she must justify herself not as a woman but as a citizen; she must attack the same problems, and be prepared to shoulder the same burdens.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Dame Enid was right, and I believe all 22 former and 25 current female senators would agree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With my colleagues Senators Troeth and Patterson, I am the third female senator out of five senators representing the Liberal Party for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Victoria. It is the first time a major political party has had a majority of its representatives as women. This goal has taken nearly 100 years for women to reach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victorian Division of the Liberal Party is the rock on which Menzies built the most successful political party in Australia. I am proud to be a member of that division and I am honoured that they have chosen me, without quotas and on merit, to replace Senator Jim Short.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fitting that the Victorian division is the first to achieve the milestone of having a majority of its senators as women. The Victorian division has had continuous female representation in the Senate since 1950. Dame Ivy Wedgwood was succeeded by Dame Margaret Guilfoyle in 1971, and my colleague Senator Kay Patterson in turn replaced Dame Margaret in 1987. This unbroken chain of 47 years is a record that will never be beaten because we will keep stretching it year by year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hon. Jim Short resigned from the Senate on 12 May this year after a distinguished record of service, firstly as the member for Ballarat in the House of Representatives, then as a senator for Victoria and as a shadow minister where he made many friends in our diverse multicultural communities. Following the 1996 election, he served as the Assistant Treasurer and helped put in place the process of financial consolidation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jim Short not only believed in the highest standards of conduct for ministers, he lived those beliefs. With grace and with dignity, he resigned his position as a minister over what many would regard as a trifling technicality. However, he believed that the standards of probity for those in public office are higher than for members of the general community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 13 May, the day after Jim Short resigned, the parliament of Victoria appointed me to fill the casual vacancy and I was sworn in on 14 May. I am not sure if a two-day turnaround is a record for replacing a senator, but it is pretty fast and it is indicative of the `can do' approach of the Victorian government, led by Jeff Kennett. The transformation of Victoria from industrial rust&hyphen;belt wasteland to a growing services and information rich 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6329"> economy is due to the visionary approach of the most successful Premier in Australia today. I am honoured to have worked in the Kennett government as a senior public servant before being appointed to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I conclude today, Madam President, I would like to thank you, the officers and staff of the Senate and my Senate colleagues for your gracious welcome and assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to thank my staff team&mdash;Sonia, Di, Catherine and Leanne&mdash;for their loyalty, friendship and commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my family and friends: I am conscious of the sacrifice that you will make in the years ahead. I thank you now both for your understanding and for your love and support which enable me to stand in this place today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to pay tribute to my husband, Giuseppe de Simone: I admire and respect you more than words can say. Thank you.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am aware that the report was tabled in the other place earlier this week. I endorse the comments made by the chair of the committee, Mrs Gallus. What is more, I endorse the emphasis Mrs Gallus put in her tabling statement on the content of the report. Similarly, I endorse the remarks that my colleagues in the other place made when they spoke to the report. I refer to the words of Mr Duncan Kerr, Mr Stephen Martin and Ms Teresa Gambaro. I understand all three members of the committee will no longer be serving on the committee. I thank them for their cooperation in developing this report. It was great fun working with them&mdash;we worked very well and very hard together&mdash;and we will miss them as the committee continues with its deliberations. We wish them well in their new roles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate my colleague Mrs Gallus, the chair of the committee. She chaired the proceedings exceptionally well. She gave everybody a fair go&mdash;particularly the witnesses&mdash;and we listened to and took into account all that was put before us in developing the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mrs Gallus paid tribute to the committee secretariat in tabling the report the other day. She referred to Andres Lomp, the committee secretary; Catherine Cornish, the senior research officer; Gabrielle Jess, the research officer; and Denise Picker and Sophia Konti, the administrative officers; and thanked them for their contribution to the work of the committee. I, from the Senate side of the committee, endorse her remarks and, in turn, thank all of the named individuals for their assistance through the inquiry and in developing the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Special thanks was attributed to Mr Christopher Dorrian, who was seconded from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs for the duration of the inquiry. He greatly assisted the committee in developing the report and I join with Mrs Gallus in thanking Mr Dorrian for his assistance.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6330">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to repeat the words that Mrs Gallus used in the other place the other day because I endorse them, and there is no need to be repetitious. I will refer to some of the comment that has emanated from the media and other places since the report has been brought down. I will refer, in the first instance, to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, which featured on its front page a small column, entitled `Backpackers to face visa curb' and referred us on to page 3, where the article was headlined, `Backpack tourists "taking our jobs"', under the by&hyphen;line of Tony Wright.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tony, you got it wrong, mate; you got it wrong. The committee was not about limiting backpackers or attacking backpackers for taking Australians' jobs. We did not do that and I will point out&mdash;and it is probably an appropriate moment now&mdash;the distinction between working holiday&hyphen;makers and backpackers. At 1.25, the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The phrase `working holiday maker' (abbreviated to `WHM') is used to describe those individuals who are the holders of a working holiday visa. During the inquiry, some people referred to working holiday makers as `backpackers'. It is important to note that the terms `working holiday maker' and `backpacker' are not interchangeable. The tourism industry definition of a backpacker is anyone who stays in a backpacker hostel. This can include holders of visitor visas and holders of working holiday visas. The important difference between the two is that people who hold working holiday visas are eligible to undertake work in Australia, while people who hold visitor visas are not eligible to work. Estimates suggest that over 200,000 backpackers travelled to Australia in 1995&hyphen;96. Among that group would have been a significant proportion of the 40,237 people granted working holiday visas in 1995&hyphen;96.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Tony Wright, you have got it wrong. I hope you can right the wrong that you have done in the way you have misled people. I had some telephone calls on that matter yesterday after the article appeared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Backpackers are not necessarily working holiday&hyphen;makers. Working holiday&hyphen;makers are a very privileged group in our community. Not only have they got the right to come in and enjoy our wonderful country, but they have got the right for a limited period of time to work while they are here.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That matter leads me on to the news release from the Tourism Council Australia, authorised by Mr Bruce Baird. One would expect someone who is getting nearly half a million dollars a year in a salary package to at least know what they are talking about when they issue press statements like this. If Mr Baird did not authorise this press statement, in which he is quoted, I would expect that there would be some blood on the floor within the Tourism Council Australia because of what is in the news release. It ends with this comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The tourist industry believes strongly that there should be no limit to the number of holiday visas issued and that the cap should be lifted as soon as possible,' Mr Baird said.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Baird has got it dreadfully and frightfully wrong, and I hope he is not deliberately seeking to mislead in putting the statement forward in the way that he has done. Of course there is no limit&mdash;no cap&mdash;on the number of tourist visas issued in Australia. There was no proposal from this committee or, to the best of my knowledge, from any other parliamentary committee for a cap on the number of tourist visas. No proposal whatsoever. We certainly have not mentioned it in our report. We have proposed in our report that the cap that is on the working holiday&hyphen;maker visa be continued for a further three years and that it be reviewed after a period of three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could agree with most of what else is in Mr Baird's press statement because, to a great degree, it does reflect the reality of things. He talks about the contribution that working holiday&hyphen;makers make to Australia. He goes on to make one point, though, that the reports claiming that working holiday&hyphen;makers are taking away jobs from Australians is a gross exaggeration. He talks about the survey that was done of TCN members. We had some of the TCN members make submissions to the committee. I will quote from a small part of one, 3.47, in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Many of the large duty free companies in the Japanese tourist market, for example, advertise in Japan for young people to come to Australia on  working holidays.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would suggest to the Senate that that is clearly a breach of the spirit of what these 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6331"> working holiday&hyphen;maker visas are about. Mr Baird ought to know that some of his members are undertaking this type of activity. I hope that he will make himself aware of it and that he will not be putting out misleading press releases of this nature in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Attention was drawn to the fact that the tourism industry is in decline and we all agreed that the working holiday&hyphen;maker is an integral part of the tourism industry. Let me reflect on the increasing numbers that have come into Australia under the working holiday&hyphen;maker visa program over the last few years. In 1993&hyphen;94 the number increased by 15.0 per cent over the previous year, in 1994&hyphen;95 it increased by 19.6 per cent over the previous year, in 1995&hyphen;96 it increased by 13.8 per cent over the previous year and last year, 1996&hyphen;97, it increased by some 24 per cent over the previous year. The minister, in a recent announcement, said that the figure for this current financial year is going to increase by 10 per cent over the last financial year. All in all, this is almost a 100 per cent increase in just over four years. So I do not really think too much attention needs to be drawn to a slowdown in the growth of working holiday&hyphen;makers. Rather, it would be one of the boom areas in the tourist industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to reflect on an article that appeared in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>. It is not something that I was aware of and perhaps, on reflection, the committee may not have given enough emphasis to the fact that working holiday&hyphen;makers may be taking more jobs away from Australians than we are aware of. The article was headed `Foreign guides lead many tourists astray' and it was by Hal Crawford. It read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When Perth tour guide Henry Yap overheard a group of tourists being confidently informed that the vast body of water lapping at the base of Mt Eliza was a lake, he knew there was something wrong.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The lake that he was referring to was, of course, the Swan River, which runs through Perth. That is a serious miscalculation, but the more serious one was an anecdotal piece of information that was given to the committee of how a Japanese tourist guide was asked why people were stopping and being silent at 11 o'clock on 11 November.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GX5">Senator TROETH</NAME><STATE> (Victoria)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(5.11 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to comment on the report of the Joint Committee on Migration. I, like Senator McKiernan, wish to thank the committee secretariat, who were always extremely helpful and hardworking in the preparation of this report. I also wish to pay tribute to my colleague Mrs Gallus, as chair of the committee, for the way that she handled it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This inquiry was a most interesting inquiry to be on in that what would look on the surface to be a relatively simple situation turned out to have some quite complex layers of employment aspects and tourism aspects. The way in which we are prepared to display the culture and working atmosphere of Australia to visitors to our shores was also a complex issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The working holiday visa program enables young people to come to Australia for 12 months and to work for each employer for not more than three months. Some aspects of this situation concerned us greatly. Like Senator McKiernan, I was disappointed in the way that the media tended to treat this, particularly those articles he pointed out by Tony Wright in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of Tuesday, 2 September and by Ben Mitchell in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. Both tended to stress that this program takes jobs away from young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leaving aside for the moment the aspect of the tour guides in Cairns, evidence provided not only in this inquiry but also with respect to previous aspects of this question tended to say that the working holiday&hyphen;maker program was not a threat to local jobs and conditions. While the committee certainly put forward in its recommendations that we would never want the working holiday&hyphen;maker visa program to be a threat to local jobs and conditions, and that it should not be used as a substitute for labour market problems, almost every witness we had argued that working holiday&hyphen;makers tended to move from job to job in seasonal type work so that they were not actually taking away jobs from young people in Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6332">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been stressed, particularly in the Riverland area of both South Australia and Victoria, and by the Northern Victorian Fruitgrowers Association, that the seasonal positions that they require are only available for short periods of time. In paragraph 340 of the report, the Victorian Fruitgrowers Association is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`At no time during our peak season are there enough Australians to fill the positions available.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That aspect of the working holiday&hyphen;maker program was repeated again by the Swan Hill Rural City Council and by the Riverland Horticultural Council&mdash;that working holiday&hyphen;makers are an essential aspect of the labour market that they are providing. The vacancies in the duty&hyphen;free shops in Cairns and the tour guide program for Cairns are probably different aspects of the question and are considered in detail in the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to realise that the working holiday&hyphen;makers bring enormous benefits to Australia and receive enormous benefits from their visits to Australia. Largely, the money they earn here, they spend here. It is being put into the local economy, and this provides a great boost for rural economies. The holiday&hyphen;makers experience enormous social and cultural development as they move around Australia and work in different occupations. The program is an important component of the tourist industry, particularly in northern New South Wales and Queensland, and it promotes mutual understanding between Australia and other nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am extremely pleased that the minister has seen fit to comment favourably on those aspects of the report which indicate that this program is to continue. One of my sons is at present in England, experiencing the benefits in reverse, as he is a working holiday&hyphen;maker in England. I would heartily commend the program to young people in Australia and to young people abroad who wish to experience Australia at first hand. This was a most satisfying inquiry to be a member of.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to add my commendations of the secretariat of the committee which worked on this report and also to thank my colleagues here for their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> contributions&mdash;as well as colleagues in the other place. Like Senator McKiernan, I will not go over the substance of the report because that has been done more than adequately in the other chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I was going to do is what both Senators Troeth and McKiernan have done, and that is to draw attention to some of the sensationalist media reports that have accompanied the release of this report. I was quite dismayed to see the exaggerations in some of the articles. Some of those people who were involved in this reference as witnesses or who provided submissions have rung my office in the last 24 hours to voice their displeasure. I am glad that the record has been set straight today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a privilege to be involved as a Democrat member in this inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, and I commend the work of not only the secretariat but all the members, including the chair of the committee, Mrs Gallus, and the deputy chair, Senator McKiernan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a few words to say on the report. I note that when the working holiday program first became subject to capping, it was initially capped at around 33,000 places. That cap then rose to 42,000, and the present Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock, raised the cap to 50,000. It has now risen to a provisional target of around 55,000. So I think we should note that the present minister has seen that it is fitting to allow a substantial increase in the number of working holiday visas issued in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has rightly identified that such numbers need to be tightly targeted, but I think the current government is at times a little confused about its migration policy rationale in this country and specifically in relation to the offering of visas. When it comes to current migration visa classes, we note that there have been changes to regulations allowing families and partners to access visas to this country. However, there has not necessarily been a change to regulations relating to those visas which involve an exchange of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I do endorse the current numbers that have been coming to this country under 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6333"> the working holiday program. For the record, it is important to note the committee's statement once again, and that is that `working holiday&hyphen;makers are an important source of supplementary labour for those industries which require short&hyphen;term casual workers&mdash;the horticultural industry, for instance. In many instances, their presence is critical at peak times.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report goes on to say that, although statistical evidence indicated that the overall impact of working holiday&hyphen;makers on the Australian labour market is minimal, the committee has identified that they have a significant impact on specific industries. Again, for various reasons, it was very difficult for the committee to assess the actual impact of the working holiday program on those industries. I reiterate the concerns voiced by my colleagues, Senator McKiernan and Senator Troeth, that some of the media reports were sensationalist in claiming that the impact of the working holiday visa program was adverse or huge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps what we have is a microcosm or snapshot of the economic impact of migration on Australia generally. As many commentators have noted&mdash;and I think I can include in that category a former Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser&mdash;immigration, by increasing the demand for goods and services,  can contribute to employment opportunities for Australians and to the economic value of the nation. That is certainly something that we picked up through this inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noted that in the previous debate on migration policy  Senator Vanstone said, `But don't the Democrats want to cut the levels of migration?' I would like to state, for the record, that the paramount concern of the Democrats is not necessarily what impact immigration has on employment or economics, because we have seen the benefits of migration in those areas, but what its impact might be on our natural environment. Unfortunately, the committee's terms of reference did not necessarily include that environmental consideration, but I know that there were 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> members of the committee who kept that in their minds as the committee progressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of particular concern to me was the potential for abuse of young workers&mdash;young female workers particularly and above all those from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds. I would like to draw the Senate's attention to recommendation 34(d) in the report which recommends that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs review&mdash;in conjunction with other relevant Commonwealth agencies&mdash;the information that is  provided to those people on working holiday visas and ensure that that information:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . identifies clearly the relevant authorities or agencies which working holiday makers should contact if they require information or experience difficulties while in Australia, particularly in relation to employment</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I, for one, would like explicit information about the unlawfulness of sexual harassment to be included in such information, and I hope the minister will take that and the concerns of the Australian Democrats in that regard on board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a fair and balanced report, as most of my colleagues have mentioned. I commend it to all honourable senators for their consideration and I urge the government to implement its recommendations.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most important duty of any government is to protect and improve the general health and well&hyphen;being of its citizens. One way a government can promote the health of the population is to minimise the use of substances known to be detrimental to health.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tobacco is such a substance. Over 50,000 studies have been undertaken over the past several decades, in many countries, which confirm that tobacco use has a demonstrably deleterious effect on human health, and that nicotine is an addictive substance. More recent studies indicate a relationship between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and the incidence of a number of diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To date, the tobacco harm minimisation strategies of the Commonwealth have incorporated legislation and regulation affecting advertising, voluntary agreements with the industry regarding substance levels in tobacco products, educational programs and campaigns, the levying of excise on tobacco products and the banning of smoking in all Commonwealth&hyphen;owned buildings. With a view to reviewing the level of industry regulation and exploring potential cost&hyphen;recovery mechanisms for the community, the Senate Community Affairs Reference Committee was directed to inquire into the Tobacco Industry and the Costs of Tobacco&hyphen;Related Illness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Committee presented its report to Parliament in December 1995. The report explored a number of issues which affect the health of Australians generally, and a number of groups in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> our society specifically. The Committee made 39 recommendations with a view to minimising the deleterious effects of tobacco through a range of Commonwealth, state and territorial government initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Committee fulfilled its obligation to provide a complete list of possible options for future action on tobacco control. The report furnishes the Government with a valuable exploration of potential mechanisms for recouping and reducing the significant costs of tobacco use to the community. The report also raises for discussion many possible avenues for further regulation of the tobacco industry, with the goal of reducing community use of this substance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the Committee's task completed, it is now incumbent on the Government to assess the feasibility of these initiatives as part of national strategies to reduce the uptake and prevalence of tobacco use in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the Report's recommendations address issues most appropriately dealt with at a state or territory level, particularly those relating to education and intervention programs. While it is not the responsibility of the Commonwealth to develop or fund community&hyphen;level initiatives, the Federal Government will continue to play its part in facilitating interstate co&hyphen;operation and collaboration on these issues through appropriate forums, such as the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report also includes many recommendations for further regulation by the Commonwealth. The strategies proposed are largely untested and, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6340"> therefore, the benefits must be regarded as potential rather than guaranteed. Problems do not necessarily vanish with the passage of a law. Additional regulation needs to yield a clear and demonstrable benefit, be enforceable and have minimal incidental disruption or side&hyphen;effects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In assessing the viability of each recommendation, the Government has sought to give due consideration to its commitment to deregulating business with a view to ensuring greater competition and efficiencies. Bodies such as the Office of Regulatory Review and the Small Business Deregulation Task Force are now prompting Government to justify the necessity, appropriateness and basis for regulation, and to ensure that there is a rational connection between the regulation and end to be sought. The fact that the validity of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992</EMPHASIS>  is being challenged in the High Court by a major tobacco manufacturer illustrates the need for all legislation to be defensible in terms of its net benefits to the public. For this reason, the Government will seek further expert advice on the potential for a number of the proposed regulatory reforms to contribute to reductions in smoking uptake and tobacco consumption.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wherever possible the Government, in conjunction with advisory bodies such as the Ministerial Tobacco Advisory Group, will use the findings of the Report to guide future research and the development of policies to further the aims of the National Tobacco Strategy.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In September 1993, Marion Merrell Dow, a manufacturer of nicotine patches, applied to list its brand of patches on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). As the nicotine patches satisfied the effectiveness and cost criteria of PBAC's statutory charter, the PBAC formally recommended PBS listing. PBAC advised that nicotine patches were most effective through a structured program and recommended that only four weeks supply be made available, instead of the usual 10 weeks, as patients would not be incurring the cost of buying cigarettes and could therefore fund the remainder of the course themselves.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In October 1994, the Federal Government considered PBAC's recommendation. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6341"> Federal Government was concerned that subsidising nicotine patches on the PBS could cost as much as $100 million a year and that the there was potential for reduced effectiveness and waste if patches were made available on the PBS rather than through a structured program.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">BACKGROUND:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Health groups have expressed a belief that the current practice of granting duty&hyphen;free status to tobacco products for international travellers is inconsistent with the Commonwealth's overall tobacco harm minimisation strategy.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Tourism and Duty&hyphen;Free Concessions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of duty&hyphen;free concessions is to facilitate the arrival of international travellers. Australia is a signatory to both the 1954 New York Convention and the 1968 OECD Convention. These deal with tourism and travelling, and include provision for minimum levels of concessions, including a tobacco products allowance.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concessions enable the efficient processing of incoming travellers with duty free purchases 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6352"> within the specified limits, without the need to assess duty or sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Tourism Commission has advised that creating a welcoming environment at international airports is an important element in an overall tourism strategy. Implementing an assessment process for all passengers carrying tobacco products is therefore inconsistent with Government objectives of facilitating and encouraging tourism traffic.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, international travellers are increasingly aware of the duty free concessions in various destinations. While it is unlikely that the inability to purchase tobacco products duty free would directly affect potential visitors' perceptions of Australia as a destination, their level of satisfaction with shopping opportunities may be affected. This would particularly be so in the case of visitors from our important source markets in North Asia, where smoking is culturally acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1993 Report into the Review of the Australian Customs Service recommended that "in light of its general policy of discouraging the sale of tobacco products, the Commonwealth consider withdrawing tobacco products from the list of duty free goods". In its May 1994 response to this report, the Commonwealth concluded that no change to the tobacco duty free concession was warranted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond to the government's response to the Community Affairs References Committee report into the tobacco industry and the cost of tobacco related illness. To put it mildly, this is a very disappointing response. Indeed, it is a response for which we have now waited some 18 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is particularly disappointing given recent developments in the United States. Just last week, tobacco companies agreed to pay the Florida state government $US11.3 billion in compensation, and the United States federal government is pursuing a national settlement of some $US368 billion. In the United States we have for the first time tobacco companies admitting that their product, when used as it is designed to be used, is harmful, is addictive and causes fatal illness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not making these admissions out of the goodness of their hearts. They have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> done their sums. We have seen them for years cynically manipulating the truth about their products, but now they have decided that the writing is on the wall. Indeed, the writing on the wall is written so large that not even the tobacco companies can refuse to read it. They have worked out what it might cost them if they keep going through the litigation process and have decided that it would be cheaper for them to enter into arrangements with the state and federal governments. In the end, it will cost them a lot less to simply get it over and done with and agree to make the payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is why some United States anti&hyphen;tobacco groups are saying that the industry is being let off too lightly. Even if this is the case, what is important is that these settlements have come about through governments having the courage to take on this industry and do the hard work, the hard slog, of going through the processes and actually starting to get back some of what it is costing the public, particularly in health costs. Some of the damage that is being done by these products is actually being recouped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why isn't the Australian government showing similar courage? We only have to look at the number of hospital beds available and the cost to Medicare to know that it is an enormous cost to us through our public health system. But, no, this government is not even prepared to take up the recommendations of the Senate committee. They do not involve it in any litigation. They do not involve it in any real hard decisions. But, no, it has decided that basically this is mostly for the too&hyphen;hard basket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is particularly important that governments such as the Australian government take a lead. We know what is happening in Asia and, if developed countries do not take a lead, it will be even more difficult for many of the Asian countries to stand up against the giant tobacco companies. We know that, as we gradually make it a little more difficult for sales to go ahead in this country, the tobacco companies focus more on Asia. They are putting their energy and their efforts into selling tobacco in developing nations. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6353">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also know that these countries are facing massive health costs as a consequence of the very strategic and deliberate push by tobacco companies into these new markets. Indeed, figures from just last week's anti-smoking conference in Beijing show us, for example, that one in four Chinese people smoke and that 500,000 people are now dying each year in China from tobacco related illnesses and that this is set to substantially increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tobacco companies are using and indeed trying to increase their sponsorship of sporting events as a way of pushing their products into countries like China. Australia has a particular role to play because those events that we are exempting, those very events that we are letting have sponsorship, are being shown in China and in Asia. Surely, our role in that cannot be ignored. This is why the response from the government is so disappointing. I believe the government has missed a golden opportunity to get rid of tobacco sponsorship once and for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also released today the much awaited Rassaby report. Again, it has been sitting on that for more than a year. The report was commissioned by the then health minister, Dr Carmen Lawrence, in 1995 to review section 18 of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act; that is, the section which allows exemptions to the ban on tobacco advertising for major cultural and sporting events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major finding of the Rassaby report is that section 18 be repealed, with the repeal taking effect from the year 2001. This is in line with recommendation No. 5 of the Senate committee report that section 18 be phased out&mdash;we said for the year 2000. As you can see, there is very little difference there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But not even the two reports combined can sway this government. I would suggest that we have actually wasted our money commissioning the Rassaby report when it can be so easily put on the shelf and its recommendations put in the too&hyphen;hard basket. I believe the government has chosen to ignore the Rassaby report's conclusions that tobacco sponsorship of glamorous international sporting events is a powerful marketing tool which does have an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> impact on the smoking habits of Australians, especially adolescents. Surely we all understand now that it is during adolescence that a lot of the damage is done. These are the very people who are most at risk from the damage caused to one's health by smoking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Rassaby report also concluded that section 18 events have relatively small impact on the national economy. The report basically says that the national government, acting in the national interest, has an obligation to place the health of Australians ahead of the relatively small economic benefits generated by these events. Of course, we all know what happened. We all know that pressure has been applied by some state governments&mdash;and I can think of one in particular that is very keen on its grand prix. Really, what we have here is a political decision, not a health decision&mdash;a decision that is purely and pragmatically political and has nothing to do with the health of Australians, particularly young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony is that we could well lose many of these sporting events to Asia anyway. They have the potential to generate significantly larger audiences than we do and, also, many of those countries have very few, if any, restrictions on advertising. However, I wish to make it clear that there are several Asian countries doing a really good job, Thailand being one of them. Thailand now has some quite significant restrictions on advertising. So sporting events are quite likely to go offshore anyway and this government has missed a golden opportunity to stand up to the tobacco industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular failure is compounded by the government's refusal to take up another very crucial recommendation from the Senate committee report: the recommendation to establish a national health promotion foundation, funded through the money that the federal government collects by way of tobacco taxes. Through that we could provide an alternative form of sponsorship, particularly for some of those events that are not so well known, for some of those events that are relatively small in size in terms of the audience that they attract.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6354">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government cannot see its way to repealing or phasing out section 18 exemption, then surely the very least it should be doing is setting up an alternative source of funding and sponsorship. VicHealth&mdash;the Victorian government's version of such a foundation&mdash;has been extraordinarily successful. It was the first one of its kind in the world. It is an idea that has now been copied by other Australian states. I think some 22 countries have now adopted this. Even the World Bank has endorsed it as a significant and very much approved way of raising money for health programs. But, no, it has been put in the too&hyphen;hard basket by this federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe it is about time this government had another look at the whole issue of hypothecation of taxes that are collected, whether they be alcohol or tobacco taxes, to put some of that money back into harm minimisation and into those particular sports that have relied on tobacco sponsorship. It is all very well to talk about education campaigns, which I think is this government's only response to the problem of young people taking up tobacco, but there are a lot of much tougher and much more important decisions that this government is avoiding. We do not just need to look at legal drugs to see how weak this government's response is to the whole drug issue. The ACT heroin trial is yet another example of where this government likes to put any hard issues. I think this government is really at a crossroads. It is time for it to reassess its approach to drug use and abuse in this country generally.</PARA></SPEECH>

Two Christmases have come and gone&mdash;the Christmas of 1995 and the Christmas of 1996&mdash;and we are getting awfully close to the Christmas of 1997, before this government response has been tabled.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we seem to be hearing is, `We do not agree with what the committee is recommending,' or `The government will seek to do things in the future,' or `We will refer.' Nothing has happened. We asked at the estimates hearings in August what consultation there will be. We were told that a lot of the recommendations related to state and local government amendments, legislation and jurisdiction. We asked what consultations had taken place with the states about this. We were told that informal discussions at an officer level had taken place, not discussions from minister to minister. There had been no correspondence minister to minister, it would appear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find that most disappointing because this is a problem that does affect all three tiers of government and their administration and jurisdiction. It is also a major problem and I suppose I should admit up&hyphen;front and early on in my speech that I do have a nursing background and I have seen people suffer the ill effects of smoking. I am a widow because my husband was a smoker; he also had a family history of heart disease. The two do not go together. Yet we have seen people still try to argue that they are not convinced that smoking causes health problems. It is not, fortunately, argued in this document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite apparent when you travel in Asia that the tobacco companies are still operating in a laissez-faire type atmosphere. There is still lots of advertising and there is still a lot of promotion work done over there. Of course they are going to take a lot of their work over there and move there. I was in Nauru during the break for a CPA presiding officers confer 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6355"> ence. Alpine must be the most commonly smoked cigarette over there because there was lots of advertising&mdash;big billboard advertising&mdash;for Alpine of the sort that we do not see in Australia.

These are the sorts of things that have been outlawed in this country or are being worked on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of major concern to people in this country, as Senator Lees said, just what activity is taking place in the Asia-Pacific region. We now know that China has started to do something about it. They are seeing alarming increases in the number of deaths from lung cancer. They attribute that to smoking. Having visited China, I can tell the Senate that smoking is a very common occurrence. If you go into a briefing or a meeting, two things happen: you will be offered green tea, which is lovely, but you will also be offered a cigarette. That was a couple of years ago. That sort of thing is all-pervasive. It gives an imprimatur of approval&mdash;that there are no problems with it and it is an acceptable thing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with some concern and disappointment when I read through this response that I find that the government has not initiated a great deal. It says that it is going to do things in the future. It has already had 21 months. This government has had 18 months to do something about this and they have not done anything. I find it most concerning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On page 13 of the response is recommendation 1 and recommendation 2, which recommends that smoking not be permitted in enclosed spaces, et cetera, including outdoor areas or places needing ventilation. It talks about some of the things that the Commonwealth has done. In 1996 cigarette smoking was banned on domestic air flights. This ban was made effective on all Australian carriers flying anywhere in the world and overseas carriers flying within Australia. But all the other years of activities that took place on this particular issue relate to the previous government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recommendation 3 recommends that nicotine transdermal patches be listed in the schedule of pharmaceutical benefits but they be only prescribed as part of a structured smoking cessation program. The government does not endorse the recommendation at this time. It says that acting on this recommendation should be delayed pending outcomes of the review of cessation models and techniques. That is fine. It goes on to give the background about the number of attempts that have been made to get it on to the PBS, but none of them have been since March 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recommendation 4 talks about incidental and accidental broadcasting or publication of tobacco advertisements being strictly monitored and enforced by the department of health. The government is currently considering a scheme for the routine enforcement of the incidental and accidental provisions, and they will seek to acquire the data information necessary. That is fine. They have had 18 months. What have they been doing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we get to the background, we see that it goes back to 1973. Labor was in government then. It mentions 1990. Labor was in government then. It also mentions 1992 and 1993. They were all times when Labor was in government. It seems that the conservatives do not want to do a great deal about this particular issue. I am most concerned about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was one issue that I felt very strongly about in the report. I am talking about the recommendation that there be a reduction in the number of retail outlets permitted to sell tobacco products and that, as an interim measure, tobacco products be isolated from other products for sale in outlets currently selling tobacco products. In the longer term we were suggesting that they move towards restricted licensed premises and tobacconists. There are a number of others as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government did not endorse recommendation 25 or any part of it. It was concerned that the imposition of a further regulatory burden on small businesses at this time runs counter to the government's establishment of the small business deregulation task force. It is a pity that they could not implement some of the recommendations out of the Reid 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6356"> committee report in the other place about small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern about nothing being done about this particular recommendation is, as I have said before and will continue to say, because I have grave concerns when I walk into places such as newsagents. They can have the gambling area&mdash;the lotto area and the lottery buying areas&mdash;down the back, separated off from the mainstream of their activities. That is not a problem. But they can have their tobacco products up with the lollies, the swap cards and all those sorts of things that appeal to children and to young adolescents and teenagers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a great problem with the juxtapositioning of tobacco products with the products that appeal to younger people and to adolescents and children. I have had discussions with the merchants who say that they have no problem and they can see no conflicts with the juxtapositioning of them next door to one another. The government has totally disregarded this. It is not even going to look at some of the reasons behind it. I am most concerned. As I have said on other occasions, I know of shops where they are selling tobacco products on one side and on the other side they are selling ice-creams.

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Noted. Clarification of the employment status of outworkers in the garment industry is complicated by constitutional limitations on the Commonwealth. In particular, the Commonwealth's constitutional power to legislate with respect to the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State is inherently limited to matters pertaining to employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In legislating to limit the scope of an industrial dispute to allowable award matters under S89A(2) of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Workplace Relations Act 1996 </EMPHASIS> (the Act), the Government has included the pay and conditions of outworkers as an allowable award matter, but only to the extent necessary to ensure that their overall pay and conditions of employment are fair and reasonable in comparison with the pay and conditions specified in a relevant award or awards for employees who perform the same kind of work at an employer's business premises. S89A(9) of the Act defines an "outworker" as an "employee, who for the purposes of the business of the employer, performs work at private residential premises or at other premises that are not business or commercial premises of the employer".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding the Victorian Government's referral of some industrial relations matters to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth has no greater power to legislate with respect to non&hyphen;employee outworkers in Victoria than it does with respect to such outworkers in other States. The specific matters referred by the Victorian Parliament are all, except for the matter of freedom of association, expressed in terms which relate to employees only.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any Commonwealth legislation seeking to alter the employment status of persons who might otherwise (at common law) not be employees would need to depend on constitutional powers other than the industrial dispute power, such as the Commonwealth's power to legislate with respect to corporations, and would be limited in its scope accordingly.

The supplementary survey provides a reliable measure of the number and characteristics of persons employed at home in Australia by industry. This survey was last conducted in September 1995, and is next scheduled to be conducted in July 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measurement of the number of home&hyphen;based workers is somewhat problematical. The ABS survey defines persons employed at home as those who worked more hours at home than elsewhere in either their main or second job. Those who worked only some hours at home or who worked in someone else's home were excluded. Problems associated with measuring the number of outworkers in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Persons Employed At Home</EMPHASIS>  survey include the fact that the outworkers may be working in another person's home, outworkers may be concentrated in certain geographic areas and therefore not representatively sampled, and outworkers may not be willing or able to provide accurate answers to survey questions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABS endeavours to respond to the needs of the users of ABS data, and regularly reviews the design of supplementary surveys. Development work for the July 1999 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Persons Employed At Home</EMPHASIS>  survey will commence at the end of 1997, and is planned to address the problems associated with the measurement of outworkers outlined above, to the extent that is possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While, in principle, the Government has no objection to the ATO liaising with the ABS in order to accurately measure the number of outworkers, the Government is conscious of community concern about the transfer of information collected by the ABS to other government agencies such as the ATO.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also notes that there are practical difficulties involved in the use of ATO information in the context of ABS surveys. The Reportable Payments System (RPS), which does not require an assessment of a worker's classification as an `outworker' or otherwise, is unlikely to provide further clarification of the numbers of outworkers involved in the garment industry.</PARA>

I can only hope, but I suspect I am wrong, that it is not a signpost of how this government is going to respond to the Productivity Commission's report with respect to the TCF industry and tariff reductions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, in looking at the government's response, I would like to highlight three main points where I think this response fails the committee, the industry, us all. Firstly, it fails to acknowledge that outworkers are being exploited. It fails to acknowledge just that basic point that this committee highlighted. However, it does&mdash;and I think in particular form for Minister Reith&mdash;highlight the desire not to constrain flexible working arrangements. So we can concentrate on that issue but not even acknowledge the several examples of exploitation that this committee found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The response also fails to accept the urgent need for ongoing labour assistance programs. In the context of an overall industry debate, where even mainstream commentators accept the need for adjustment programs to deal with tariff reductions, and in this industry of all industries at this point in time, the government fails to acknowledge that need despite the recommendations of the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The response also, most importantly, because it is also a signpost of a number of other issues, fails to acknowledge the important recent agreement between the Australian Retailers Association and the TCFUA, the union, to eliminate exploitation of outworkers 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6363"> in the apparel industry. It even fails to acknowledge that that agreement has occurred&mdash;that significant agreement in dealing with this problem, significant in terms of bringing the industry together to deal with that problem, significant in that this report concentrated significantly on that issue, and the minister fails to even mention it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contrast, Labor sees the resolution of outworker exploitation as fundamental to the future assistance arrangements for this industry. That is why this report is seen as a signpost with respect to how this government may deal with the TCF industry and tariff reduction. Labor has been working with key industry parties to achieve joint industry arrangements to deal with the outworker problem. Substantial progress has been made, as shown by the recent breakthrough with the Australian Retailers Association. As a consequence of this agreement, Labor believes that the funds should be allocated immediately to implement the code of practice&mdash;as the government has been foreshadowing for some time, but the government does not even seem to know that this agreement exists. Funds had originally been taken off the union and the government has been advising us for some time that it is prepared to look at allocating funds if the industry can come to some form of agreement. The agreement is there, but it is not even referred to in this response to the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This inadequate response comes as the government has slashed around $20 million of assistance per annum to the industry, with up to $3.8 million of the $7.8 million assistance package for the TCF industry not spent in the last financial year. Additionally, the government slashed over $15 million in funding to labour assistance programs in the TCF industry in the last financial year. The government has failed to address the substantial issues that were raised in this report and has demonstrated quite clearly in this report&mdash;and I hope it is not a signpost of what might arise in the next few weeks&mdash;that it has abandoned TCF industry outworkers.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to this motion. It is two years since former Senator Sid Spindler 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the Australian Democrats referred the outworker matter to the Economics References Committee for inquiry. He did so because&mdash;despite the closeness of the Labor government of the day, which at that stage was 12&hyphen;years&hyphen;old, with the union movement&mdash;the outworker community had not been properly attended to in the structure of government policy and government expenditure. He recognised and was able to persuade both the coalition, then in opposition, and the Labor Party of the need for an inquiry. It was, as Senator Jacinta Collins has rightly said, conducted in a truly cross&hyphen;party basis. The senators and the secretariat worked very hard to produce what was in the end a good report. When Senator Spindler remarked on his Economics References Committee term of reference on the outworkers, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are rightly disgusted with child exploitation and slave labour conditions in other countries. However, here in our own backyard we are tolerating the exploitation of home workers, mainly women, mainly migrants, and, one suspects, also children in conditions which we have fought for decades to eliminate from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Spindler and the Senate itself do not believe that Australian workers of any kind should not be given a fair go, should not be accorded the proper working conditions and the proper safeguards both from the Australian community's point of view and from the point of view of Australian law. He remarked that there were persistent reports of damage to health, of injuries, of long hours, of poor conditions and particularly of low pay. He said it is time that we as a society got to the bottom of what is happening. It is our belief that the committee did do that. By and large they reached a far better understanding than we have ever had before of the nature and conditions of those workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We move on two years later to wanting the government to get to a situation where it can advance the cause of outworkers appropriately. It has properly and rightly indicated that outworker matters, particularly those relating to children, are being pursued with increasing interest and force on the international arena. It is slow, but progress is being made. But within our own country we can afford to make far more rapid progress.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6364">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the Australian Democrats who introduced outworkers for the first time into Australian law&mdash;maybe it is not so&mdash;certainly for the first time into the Workplace Relations Act, where we included outworkers as a specific category of workers who needed appropriate recognition. That, we thought, was an advancement and would give the minister and the government a mechanism by which they could start to accelerate improvements for this community of Australian employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I note from the government's response that it has indicated that the transfer of industrial relations responsibilities from Victoria to the Commonwealth did not include outworkers. Frankly, that is a surprise to me. I am disappointed to read that that is the government's interpretation of events. I would have expected the government to have included in its report, therefore, a commitment to persuading the Kennett government to pass amending legislation to put those outworkers across as well. I am not persuaded that the Kennett government would automatically say no. Why should it? It has indicated that it is prepared to pass over other workers. Why doesn't this government make an effort?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are positive elements, of course. There are positive programs the government is embarking on in the training area. But I feel underlying the report is a defensiveness, an unwillingness to be proactive, a kind of passivity about the report. I do not necessarily have a problem with the government not being wholehearted about every recommendation. That is its right. But passivity of this kind, an unwillingness to be proactive, an unwillingness to be gung-ho and say, `We are going out there to make sure that as much as possible can be done' for what I would consider to be one of the weakest and most vulnerable of all Australian working communities is a great shame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report should be damned with faint praise for that feeling of passivity and for the lack of proactiveness and genuine concern and commitment to advancing the status of outworkers. I am confident enough in my colleagues in the Senate to know that they will not leave it there. They will take it back to the Economics References Committee 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> within an appropriate time-frame to have another look at it and to apply more pressure on the government to be proactive, not to be passive, and to get on with advancing the cause of these workers. I say to my colleagues in the Senate who are of that mind: you will certainly have my support and the support of the Australian Democrats to keep applying the pressure in this area.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not on this committee but the issue of the footwear, clothing and textile industries and their outworkers has been one of great concern to me for some time. I looked briefly at the government's response to the recommendations today. It does deserve, obviously, to be taken away and looked at in more detail. That is why I am happy to seek the leave of the Senate to continue my remarks later or hope that somebody does that today. We should all have a chance to look at the ramifications of this report in time to come back at a later stage when the legalities of the statements that have been made can be addressed more fully, because they are important. One that springs to mind is recommendation No. 1:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that the government examine ways to clarify the employment status of outworkers in the garment industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That seems to be a fairly reasonable thing to ask&mdash;to clarify their status of employment. It is even mentioned in this response from the government&mdash;to put it in two words, the response from the government was `too hard'&mdash;that `clarification of the employment status of outworkers in the garment industry is complicated by constitutional limitations on the Commonwealth'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of us listened to the debate on industrial workplace relations that took place here and realised that there certainly was a difference of opinion even within this chamber in relation to the constitutional obligations of the Commonwealth and the ability of the Commonwealth to act in relation to industrial relations. It is very interesting that the Commonwealth does act when they want to reduce workers' pay and conditions but when they need to protect workers' pay and condi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6365"> tions they put their hands behind their backs. A very strange thing indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is interesting is that in this response from the government they mention that section 89A(9) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 defines an outworker as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an employee who, for the purposes of the business of the employer, performs work at private residential premises or at other premises that are not business or commercial premises of the employer.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet, their response was that it was too hard; they did not say that, but that is a paraphrase. The response continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the Commonwealth's constitutional power to legislate with respect to the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State is inherently limited to matters pertaining to employees.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the irony. In the bill they have defined outworkers as being employees. So in fact it has argued its own case to a certain extent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may well be those people who still manage to fall between the cracks, and they may be those people who for various reasons are classified as independent contractors. But we know that the government has said that that is not what individual contracts are meant to do. They are not supposed to call people who are not really running their own business `contractors', people who are in fact employed by someone who has the power over them to set the conditions of work and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is a range of people who for some reason are being called `small business' or `self&hyphen;employed' or `individual contractors' or who are not being called employees, perhaps we have to start asking this question: why is it that somehow or other those people can fall between the cracks? If they are, under this definition, called `employees' then it is time for the government to stop saying that this is too hard and to start dealing with such simple things as clarifying the employment status and then dealing with them and treating them fairly, which everybody must think is a reasonable thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recommendation 2 is also very disappointing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that the Government consider reinstating an amnesty for a period to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> allow community groups sufficient time to communicate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">not a radical thing&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">with the outworkers and to persuade them of its benefits. The Committee further recommends that funding from the TCF 2000 Development Package be made available for community groups to inform outworkers of the amnesty.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Who is going to pay for that? It is not unreasonable to suggest that some funding be made available. But the answer is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not agreed. The Government does not believe that a reinstatement of the social security limited amnesty would be a viable or productive proposition.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If I was a cynic I would say that the government is keen to get their numbers of non&hyphen;complying social security people up. That is, it wants to put it to the public that there are lots of dole cheats out there&mdash;not people who do not know what their rights are, not people who do not know that they are not allowed to be exploited, not people who do not know that there are ways that they should be able to survive in Australia in 1997 without having to starve or live on starvation wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is considered that data matching by the Department of Social Security is sufficient:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Data&hyphen;matching by the Department of Social Security commenced immediately following the end of the amnesty period, and has been underway since that time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What does that mean? Does data matching by Social Security equate to giving information to people about their rights? I do not think it does. The data matching may well equate to finding people and getting those statistics so that Senator Newman can come into the Senate and say, `Look how many dole cheats we've got. Isn't this dreadful. We really would like the public to have faith in our social security system.' I think that that is what this is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really is time to look at actual outcomes and circumstances and at whether people have ever had a fair go and do know, especially if they are not English speaking, what the issues are, what their rights might be and what rights may have been taken away in the way they have been treated.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6366">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said that I would speak for a short time. I know there are other people waiting to speak. But I hope that this will stay on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. I hope people will take it away and look at it in terms of a further response to the government, especially in relation to the legalities and the constitutionality, and make sure that what we end up with is a fair outcome for those people who are providing basic goods in Australia&mdash;footwear, clothing and textiles, and food, clothing and shelter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As chairman of the Economics References Committee when this inquiry first commenced&mdash;which, as Senator Murray said, was the result of a term of reference moved in the Senate by former Senator Sid Spindler&mdash;I want to place on record that during that committee inquiry there was a unanimity of purpose in that nobody on either side of this chamber wanted to see workers exploited to the extent it was alleged prior to this inquiry taking place. It was a very important inquiry which in the end came up with recommendations. There may have been one or two exceptions but in most cases the recommendations were unanimous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having made those recommendations it was then up to the government of the day to respond. The government has seen fit to respond to the various recommendations in the way it sees as appropriate for the current situation. I was a chairman of other inquiries that this committee undertook. I note that the previous government would not respond to the recommendations of a CSIRO inquiry in particular. In this case the government has responded and while senators from the opposition and some of the other minor parties may not agree with the response, the response is here and there are many issues which the government has taken up and which it intends to act on out of that report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some areas where they do not agree, and Senator Margetts has just highlighted one of them concerning amnesties for outworkers, et cetera. But it is worth remembering, and I will conclude on this note before 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> seeking leave to continue my remarks, that at the end of the report one of the recommendations is that 12 months after putting down the report the committee review what has taken place in the industry to see whether any further recommendations should be made, or comment further on things that had happened since the government's response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee is about to undertake that review of conditions or how things have changed since the report was written, and I think that probably when that review is done lots of the things that have been raised by Senator Jacinta Collins, Senator Murray and Senator Margetts will be issues that are included in that report. But I would reiterate that there was a unanimous view on that committee that nobody wants to see people, particularly those with poor English skills, being exploited in the outworkers industry, and it is the intention of the government in its own way, the way it sees fit, to make sure that that does not happen.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amount of the windfall tax will be 100 per cent of the refund claimed. However, the windfall tax will not apply to refunds in two circumstances. Firstly, the windfall tax will not apply to refunds which would have been made even if the franchise fees were valid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the windfall tax will not apply to the portion of a refund of a liquor franchise fee which relates to a licensing period after 6 August 1997.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When this bill was last before the committee, I was part way through what I had to say. Since then I have considered what Senator Sherry had to say in his generous remarks about my ability, such as it is, and I have looked at part 7 again. There is a problem with it, I think. It is a problem not so much of policy but almost of form. The act provides for certain things to be done and then creates a regime of offences to ensure that those things are done. I was wondering whether the way it is being done has been considered properly. For example, section 60 on page 36 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The powers under sections 52 and 53, paragraph 54(a) and sections 57 and 58 may be exercised only as provided in this section.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Subsection 3 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The powers may also be exercised in relation to any person for the purposes of an inquiry to the extent that the subject matter of the inquiry relates to a subject of Commonwealth power.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One of the powers that a chair or a commissioner appointed by the chair can do is summons people to a hearing. If that person does not attend, that person can be imprisoned. That person must answer whatever questions are asked, as long as it does not incriminate him or her.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6371">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The width of this particular part is very wide. A minister could be summonsed in certain circumstances by a single commissioner who has been left alone because of circumstances that develop. That minister could be asked, on the wording of this section, what had been discussed within his or her department&mdash;indeed what had been discussed within cabinet. In other words, the sorts of things that are asked during estimates by eminent people such as Senator Sherry, Senator Hogg and Senator Murray but which are never answered can be asked by a commissioner or by a couple of commissioners. There is a requirement that answers be given under the pain of imprisonment up to six months, which seems quite extraordinary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under section 55 a person is saved from incriminating himself or herself but is not saved from giving commercial in confidence information because there is no exception put to that. So people can be asked how their business runs. A department of state can be asked how it conducts its affairs. It can be asked all these matters by a commissioner who is not an elected person, like a member of parliament, and the person has to answer it. The interesting thing is that a commissioner can issue the summons, bring someone before him and ask that person all sorts of questions which must be answered under the pain of a sentence of imprisonment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sorts of things that might be asked by this body would seem not to be the sorts of things that you would want to give these powers for. I am sure these powers are put there because they appear in other related legislation. The Productivity Commission will take over the powers of the Industry Commission, the Economic Planning Advisory Commission and the Bureau of Industry Economics. No doubt they have powers to get information, and those powers have simply been transferred across to this body but I think made quite draconian. It will be interesting to see whether these sorts of offences bear the same penalties in other legislation that they do in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the Copyright Tribunal has certain powers, but I do not think the penalties it can hand out are the penalties that are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provided for here. As I said before, I do not think this is a matter of policy; I think it has been put in because people say, `This is an act. We have to enforce the provisions of this act, and this is the way we are going to do it.' If it is a matter of policy, it is a very interesting policy indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All sorts of things can be asked by commissioners, as the act now sets out. The commissioners themselves do not have to have any qualifications that would involve a sense of what would be fair in asking a question and getting an answer. They do not have to have legal training. Lawyers are often criticised, but one thing they do have is a sense of a fair line of questioning. The commissioners do not have to be equipped in any way with qualifications that might enable them to exercise that judgment. Two of them can get together on an inquiry, summons whomever they feel is appropriate and ask them such questions as they want about how their business runs. If the people summoned are members of the Commonwealth Public Service, they can ask them whatever they want about how the department runs. If they are ministers, they can ask them how they are carrying out their ministerial duty. If those questions are not answered, the result might ultimately be that these people end up in gaol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would ask the parliamentary secretary whether those issues have been considered. It may be that they have. Section 57 says that the commission can order that particular piece of evidence not be made public. So perhaps it does contemplate that all sorts of secret things may be sought and obtained. It is interesting to read part of section 58. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If documents are produced or given to the Commission under this Part&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and the commission can, as I say, get all sorts of very interesting documents, and very secret and confidential documents&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond as succinctly as I can, because the debate on this bill has now gone into about its eighth hour. This is not to say that it is not an important matter; some of the matters we are dealing with are controversial. But this has been a long consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cooney: firstly, as Senator Sherry said at the very outset of the debate on debate on this amendment, the proposals for fines and penalties are the absolute equivalent of what is in the Industry Commission Act. I did not note any concern raised by you when that document went through the Senate back in about 1989. Even though I was not here to personally witness it, I have searched the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and have not been able to find your raising these concerns. The powers of this commission are, for all intents and purposes, identical to those given to the Industry Commission.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator Sherry</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Much greater.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You can argue that. Also, you can argue that, because we are bringing three bodies together, we have a bigger body with more prestige, and so forth. But I do not accept that argument. I have said that many times, and I do not intend repeating it because it does not add to the information in relation to this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say that the reality is that at no time during the past seven years approximately that the Industry Commission has had these penalties available to it, even if you argue that the Productivity Commission may have some greater powers in some areas&mdash;and I do not accept that; at the moment it has very similar powers to the Industry Commission&mdash;has the Australian Labor Party or, in fact, any other party sought to amend these provisions. There was no committee reference, nor was there even any discussion about it. But Senator Cooney is someone who keeps a close watch on these things and we are lucky to have such 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> senators in this place&mdash;and I mean that quite earnestly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also say that one of the reasons for the fact that these matters have not been raised is that at no stage have these penalties ever been applied to one individual citizen or other legal entity, such as a corporation. That is not to say we should not have a close look at them; if you have these things hanging over your head, they are important matters. So it is not as though they have been used by the Industry Commission frivolously or for any wrong purpose in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is serious concern, the coalition is prepared to have a look at these matters. But, because all we are doing is taking the provisions straight out of a bill which was put through this place in 1989 by the Labor Party and which was turned into law in 1990, and because there have been no problems raised with any of those provisions, we cannot see a strong argument for supporting this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we do foreshadow that, if these proposals in the bill are supported, the government is not only favourably disposed to having these matters&mdash;the matters that you have referred to generally in your contribution and the proposal that Senator Sherry has moved by way of an amendment&mdash;referred to an appropriate Senate committee; we are quite happy to do that. But more so, we are prepared to commit ourselves&mdash;and I do so on behalf of the government&mdash;to favourably look at any recommendations of that committee. So in other words, we are prepared to look at that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not think there is any good ground, and we have not heard a good argument, for imposing the restrictions. They have not been a problem in the past seven years. They were not perceived to be a problem by anybody in this place, not a soul, back in 1989. They have not been used at all in the seven years. But we are not saying that we got it perfect. We are not saying that the Industry Commission had it right. What we are saying is that we think it would be a worthwhile use of  an appropriate Senate committee to look at the penalties; but in the meantime, we would just move the Industry Commission Act penalties 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6373"> across into the Productivity Commission. That is what we would urge support for.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the parliamentary secretary for that. I think what he has said is accurate. I think the reason that these penalties have not become a problem is that they have never been invoked, and the Industry Commission has gone about its business without finding the necessity to call upon these things. That raises a couple of points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point is this. If those penalties have never been invoked, it is perhaps time we abandoned them. I understand what the parliamentary secretary is saying when he comments that these ought to be looked at&mdash;and I think he is right&mdash;at some stage. But I think these are very savage penalties, as Senator Sherry says. If we were to get somebody, a commissioner or a chairman, starting using these penalties, their draconian nature would become apparent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure, as I said, it is not a matter of policy. I am sure it comes about because the people drafting the legislation feel that they have to have some penalty to enforce the provisions. But if you read those parts&mdash;leaving aside the history and the fact that we are no doubt going to have someone reasonable appointed to the position of chairman&mdash;and you look at the black letter law, it is very draconian. If they are on the books and they are draconian, that is a bad thing. If they are not needed&mdash;and history would seem to indicate that they are not needed&mdash;they should be dropped because they are too draconian to have on the statute book.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would ask that this not be put aside but that the whole issue is looked at closely. I do accept, by the way, that I did not say anything about this and I was perhaps in a better position than most to look at it. As Senator Sherry pointed it out to me, it became apparent, so if anybody is to be criticised for what has gone on in the past, it is probably me. But I would like to recover that and see that this is looked at, and see where we go.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition would quite genuinely like to see this matter referred. We will support a referral of this matter to a committee, and we have said we will favourably look at any recommendations of a committee on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say that they are maximum penalties&mdash;and I think you do know that. They are not imposed by some rampant chairman running around trying to lock people up. They are matters that are decided by a court, just as, I suppose, when you are fined for not attending a federal election a court can decide to gaol you. And they often do gaol Australians for not turning up to get their name ticked off. So it fits in that category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that imposing a fine of something like $250 on a corporation like News Corp or Southcorp or some other body would be, for them, like flicking off a mosquito. It is not a penalty. But we do believe that the penalty issue should be looked at and it is an appropriate use of a Senate committee to do that. We think there is no reason why, in the meantime, we should not move the Industry Commission penalty regime into the Productivity Commission, and then you can refer it off to a Senate committee tomorrow if you want to. Give notice right now, refer it off tomorrow and come back to us in a few weeks time with a recommendation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Campbell, gaols are scary places to contemplate. I appreciate that you say it is a maximum penalty but the maximum penalty would be six months gaol. Whether these are white&hyphen;collar crimes deserving of that potential penalty, I do not know. I am constrained in this debate&mdash;like you&mdash;by a lack of history. Generally speaking, penalties and punishments arise as a result of society assessing a practice which is unacceptable to it. I do not know what the Labor Party government at that time had as evidence of practice which would have warranted what are apparently draconian provisions.Was there any

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot answer that question, Senator Murray. I do not intend taking too much longer on this debate, except to say that we genuinely said we will have the matter looked at. My best advice at hand is to say that these have been regarded as generic penalty terms for similar sorts of provisions. I do not commit myself to this, but I have responsibility for the Australian Bureau of Statistics&mdash;amongst other bodies&mdash;at the moment, and I suspect that similar terms apply for non&hyphen;compliance with their requests for information. I know, because of my interest in the matter, that similar penalties apply to people who exercise what is a right of freedom in most other countries, and who do not turn up to vote at a federal election and then refuse to pay the fine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that these are generic terms but I think the proposal that I have put forward is a sensible way to go. These provisions have been around; Senator Cooney described them as draconian. He voted for them in 1989, but you cannot judge someone fairly in 1997 for an act back in 1989. He said they should be looked at and I know that Senator Cooney would want the process that I have described to go ahead. That is what I hope the Senate will support, but I cannot add anything further to this debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly would be supporting amendments Nos 15 and 16 from the opposition, but I do think it is interesting that the parliamentary secretary has indicated that he would support a review of the penalties within this. It seems to me that there are a lot of bigger and more comprehensive things that need to be reviewed. The penalties may need to be reviewed but the whole kit and caboodle also needs to be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission's stocktake indicated that there should be an independent review of the operation of the key elements of the national competition policy framework and outcomes achieved, commencing in 1998. I do not know what they would consider to be an independent review&mdash;and I am not quite sure whether I would go along with who the government would probably consider would do an independent review&mdash;but the very least we need to do is look at a Senate review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are lots of things that need to be looked at, not just a tweaking of the wires. The whole workings of competition policy need to be looked at, as well as the outcomes. If the parliamentary secretary is willing, for a few weeks, to go on working out whether or not the fines are set at the right level then perhaps he should be considering whether or not we should do what the inquiry from the House of Representatives recommended, which was that we start looking at the socioeconomic impacts of competition policy&mdash;not

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1994 the Senate debated a series of bills related to the World Trade Organisation. It has not been until 1997 that that legislation has actually affected many people in Australia, and not many people in Australia knew at the time that it was going to affect them. It affected them in terms of the kinds of industries there were, how they operated, where employment was available, the terms of employment and a whole lot of other things including environmental rules, social rules and all sorts of things. They were affected by the agreement that was made and the bills that were put through here in 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, in 1997 we are beginning to find industries like the citrus industry, which was clearly identified in 1993 and 1994 as being problematic under those bills, having difficulties. The government at the time said that, no, everything would be okay. The textiles, clothing and footwear industries, which at the time were identified as going to be in serious difficulties as a result of the nature of the agreement, now in 1997 are being affected.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We found there were other affected industries. They include parts of the dairy industry, the egg industry, the car industry and the sugar industry&mdash;we had all sorts of industries at the time saying that they had problems and most of them were told to shut up because everyone else would be okay. They are all surfacing now, three or more years later. In 1995 we came to this chamber and, with scandalously little debate, signed up to the 1995 competition policy legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only now are community groups beginning to see the impact that this is likely to have on them. They are not just industry groups; they are any people in the community who are concerned about the level and quality of services and accountability. They include environment groups, social justice groups, ordinary people in the community, consumers, all sorts of people right across the spectrum&mdash;people in rural and regional Australia, people from local governments. Everywhere you look, people are beginning to see the impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They still do not necessarily understand it. They are beginning to see that they are impacted, but they do not know exactly what they should do about it. It seems to me that maybe we will wait another year and all of this will be crunched into a very powerful structure. We have already got the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, which has been mentioned quite a lot in this debate, and we have the National Competition Council chewing through 2,000 pieces of legislation as we speak to see whether they are anti&hyphen;competitive. We have now got the Productivity Commission and today we have given them greater powers and less scrutiny than they had before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard someone in the media the other day say that people should not be frightened of change; they should just go with the flow. I say that those people who are not frightened of change probably do not know exactly what is happening to them&mdash;and there are many people who do not. This is very complex and a lot of people do not understand. Competitive neutrality: what does it mean? Lowest cost tenders: what does that mean? Outcomes: they do know that; it means that things cost more, services that were available before are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6379"> not available any more, there are simply not those things there that they used to know, they have to pay more for things or they cannot get them from the same places and so on&mdash;they are not convenient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of changes occurring, but not many people are in a position to recognise from where those changes are coming. There is time, I hope, for people to make their comments and to talk to people to find out what the issues are. Unfortunately, this bill is one of those steps in the wrong direction as far as I am concerned. It is jumping in with two feet; it is putting certain values&mdash;the dollar and private profits&mdash;above almost every other real value. There are some nice words and we will be looking to see whether those nice words do come to fruition. I also think that the actual basis of the competition policy will probably be stronger than anything else we have said today. That is unfortunate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to think that it will be less than another two or three years before people come to realise that we ought to be pointing the finger not at those people who fall in the process, and blame them in scapegoat politics, but at those people who are making these decisions without proper heed of the social, environmental and economic impacts that they are having.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I strongly oppose the way that this legislation has been put through; I strongly oppose the blind faith and ideology that has been used to shove this through, despite the many concerns that are arising in this society; and I strongly urge that we take the time to look at what these impacts are and make sure that we can change them before it is too late.</PARA></SPEECH>

You would think that they would have made a substantial contribution in this important debate rather than trying to make silly interjections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason why Labor will be opposing the  Productivity Commission Bill 1996  is that a number of the core amendments and changes that we sought to be made to what is to be a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> greatly enhanced Industry Commission have unfortunately been defeated. I note the earlier vote on the second reading by Senator Kernot, representing the Democrats, in opposing this legislation on the second reading. I did note Senator Margetts's vote and I did note Senator Colston's vote as well. I particularly noted the comments that Senator Kernot made at the ACTU congress this morning. I am sure that they will be viewing with interest the position that the Democrats take on the third reading of this legislation. It will be interesting to see whether the consistency is matched with the rhetoric of Senator Kernot at the ACTU congress this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, there are a number of major amendments that unfortunately were not carried with respect to the Productivity Commission Bill. In particular, we have major concerns with the expansion of the functions of this new revamped Productivity Commission. I do not intend to keep the Senate for long. But we did point out that there is an extensive expansion of the Productivity Commission. One area in particular concerns a new power to receive and investigate complaints about the implementation of competitive neutrality arrangements as well as the combining of many of the previous functions of the three successive bodies. We find that to be totally unacceptable in the new Productivity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to policy guidelines for the commission, which was another major area of concern for Labor, unfortunately, there are still a number of areas in the policy guidelines with which we have a fundamental disagreement. One of those guidelines is the reference to the regulation of industry, including regulation by states, territories and local government, where this is consistent with the social and economic goals of Commonwealth government in the context of this greatly enhanced Productivity Commission. Earlier this evening we dealt with some issues, again in the context of a greatly enhanced Productivity Commission, relating to clause 7 of the legislation, which relates to offences. They are a number of the outstanding issues in this Productivity Commission Bill which we are considering that we have great concerns with.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6380">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I do not want to take up the time of the Senate unduly. We have great concerns with the Productivity Commission as it has been presented to the Senate. There have been some changes but, unfortunately, not enough to satisfy the Labor opposition. The old Industry Commission is certainly a much better organisation than the proposed new Productivity Commission, as amended by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Labor, without hesitation or fear, will be voting against the third reading of this legislation. If the third reading is defeated, the old Industry Commission will still be in existence. The old Industry Commission still being in existence is a lot better than this Productivity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, if the Australian Democrats want to argue&mdash;particularly after Senator Kernot's comments this morning, that I am sure will be widely reported amongst the trade union movement and the media&mdash;that their version of an improved Productivity Commission Bill is better than the old Industry Commission, it will be interesting to see them sustain that argument in wider forums. That is Labor's position and that is how we intend to vote on the third reading.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, you can guess from the reactions of Senator Sherry that I have been speaking to him prior to the amendment moved by Senator Harradine. The Australian Democrats loathe Labor's Industry Commission. We believe that Labor's Industry Commission destroyed many industries, destroyed over 200,000 jobs and pursued a one-eyed ideological campaign which did enormous damage to our economy and our country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have asked Senator Sherry if he would be prepared to vote both bills down with us so that both the Industry Commission and the Productivity Commission would go. We have made no secret, either in this debate or in the wider forums, of our attitudes to the Industry Commission and the Productivity Commission because we believe that they are tainted with that ideology originally set in place by Labor. However, Senator Sherry, on behalf of Labor, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has indicated that he is not prepared to vote down the Industry Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My firm personal belief is that the Productivity Commission, as improved, is a far better animal than is the Industry Commission. I have a great deal of trouble persuading my colleagues to shift from the position which we have adopted, which is to vote `no' to both. The consequence is that we will be left with the old Industry Commission. I have been handed a note from my party colleagues indicating that they have declined to accept my advice that we should in fact abstain, which to me was the only honourable route that we could take. However, we are placed in an impossible position, and I understand the position we are in. We will therefore be voting `no' to both bills.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The township of Jabiru in the Northern Territory has developed a unique and special characteristic. In voting terms traditionally for years and years the Labor Party held that seat with 57 per cent of the primary vote. That 57 per cent dissipated from the traditional voting pattern of that township at the 1996 federal election, when my federal colleague Nick Dondas and I achieved a change. We promoted a proposal to scrap the three&hyphen;mine uranium policy. At that election, in 1996, the vote shifted from the normal 57 per cent ALP, 43 per cent CLP that had been the traditional voting pattern to one of the ALP 45 per cent and the CLP 55 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At last week's 1997 Northern Territory election this voting pattern of 45 per cent, 55 per cent was maintained. The community is different in that the population basically comprises three important groups: Aborigines, national park workers and mine employees. The seriousness of our policies on resources and the environment was carefully measured and resulted in what I would consider was that mind shift change in 1996, maintained this year in the Northern Territory election last Saturday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me highlight some of the issues in the last 18 months of the Howard government that are now having an effect and will have an effect in Jabiru, in the surrounding Kakadu national park, in the immediate environs of that area and probably more generally in Arnhem Land. At last Saturday's election there was also a significant voting pattern change in a number of communities right throughout Arnhem Land, which again highlights the issues that are being drawn out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently the Senate considered a select committee report on uranium mining and milling in Australia. I have spoken previously in the Senate on the various issues that were 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6382"> canvassed in that report. I did commend at that point not only my colleagues on this side of the chamber but also the welcome mood change within the Labor Party on the issues of uranium milling and mining in Australia. That Senate report has obviously gone on to highlight the issues that have now compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent months there have been a number of other important initiatives. I would commend to the attention of senators and the public the announcements by the Minister for the Environment, Senator the Hon. Robert Hill, who has recently released the Kakadu regional social impact study as part of the important considerations for the Kakadu region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That study has been conducted over the last six or 12 months in a professional manner. The report was developed after two important considerations: an Aboriginal project committee gave the matter detailed and thorough consideration, and the main body of the study advisory group to the report also made a number of key recommendations. These will comprise a very important basis on which the recommendations that Senator Hill has now made to the minister for resources, Senator Parer, will be considered, particularly for the important project of Jabiluka in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of this, these three important constituencies that intertwine in this area do have some important and significant issues to be addressed. It is obviously a part of the Northern Territory where it is important that special community consultations happen to ensure that all sectors of that community within both the national park and the township of Jabiru itself are consulted. Those issues are very closely aligned to mining interests, whether in the continuing project at Ranger or the proposal for development at Jabiluka.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are important government considerations for the federal government and the Northern Territory government to consider in coming months. We must guarantee that employment, education and training are properly available not only to the Aboriginal community who live in the park region but also to people in the township itself. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issues of housing, particularly if any expanded mining proceeds, health services, important social programs in alcohol, and community facilities such as sporting and cultural activities, women's resources, and cross&hyphen;cultural training must be addressed to ensure that the community goes on and develops special arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have taken the time to read the proposal with regard to the export of uranium from Jabiluka orebody No. 2 and the environmental assessment report that has been submitted to Senator Hill on this occasion. It includes a number of recommendations that are vital to the community and which address those issues that were environmentally focused. I am pleased to note that the report certainly highlights areas for special attention. Similar to the recent Senate report, it also highlights that there is no need for any deliberate or special constraints other than those that can be totally accommodated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is the area one of the most heavily regulated mining communities, but it already contains within it the important support on environmental issues of the Office of the Supervising Scientist, suitable auditing procedures are already embraced, there are cooperative arrangements between the Northern Territory government and the federal government, and there is a determined effort to ensure that Aboriginal liaison is pulled together and that we do see a comprehensive environmental safety and health management system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Kakadu attracts something like 235,000 tourists per year at the moment. Many of these visitors not only focus on the natural attraction of the park itself but are able to focus on the issues surrounding uranium mining at Ranger. The public exposure to this is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aboriginal community of the region is fragile. There are differences of opinion, there are jealousies and there are important issues to do with the traditional owners, many of whom do not live in the local area but still have a sense of place and community that is important and must be accommodated. Importantly, there are many other Aboriginal people and Territorians who chose to use the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6383"> region to accommodate all these issues relating to mining, tourism, conservation and urban lifestyle. As we pull together each and every one of these issues, it is important to recognise that for the next decade or so Jabiru and Kakadu will continue to be major media focus points, and not just because of the radicalisation of so many of the small group demonstrators who constantly visit the area or wish to highlight for other political purpose their own agendas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community clearly demonstrated by the way they voted last week in the Northern Territory election and at the federal election of March 1996 that it supports the policies of the Country&hyphen;Liberal Party in the Northern Territory and the Liberal and National parties federally with regard resources, development and the environment. It certainly will be an area that, whilst it will always be under the microscope, will develop logically, very carefully and very fruitfully for the Australian and Northern Territory economies.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6383"><TITLE>Second Sydney Airport

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today this government finally got something right. Today this government announced that it would not proceed any further with its proposal to locate Sydney's second airport at Holsworthy. It is unfortunate, however, that it has taken 15 months and at least $6 million&mdash;probably more&mdash;of taxpayer's money for this government to come to the conclusion that what the Labor Party and the communities of south western Sydney, the Sutherland shire and the Illawarra have been telling them was the only conclusion they could ever reach, and that is that the Holsworthy site was never a suitable site for Sydney's second airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hundreds of thousands of people in the area petitioned this government and told this government that this was a crazy proposal. Local councils, community groups and, as I said, consistently the Australian Labor Party told this government that their decision last May to include Holsworthy in the EIS process was ludicrous and should be abandoned. But the government never listened. They kept on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with this proposal until eventually they were forced, by weight of the sheer overwhelming evidence that this would be an environmental and social disaster, to reach the only conclusion possible, that is, that Holsworthy could not be considered in any way suitable for Sydney's second airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision that they reached, and announced today, is exactly the same as the decision made by the Labor government back in 1985&mdash;that Holsworthy is unsuitable. So what we have seen from this government today is a recognition that the community was right, that the Labor Party was right, that the former government was right. But, unfortunately, they have had to waste $6 million of taxpayers' money to come to that conclusion. In the process, over the last 15 months they have created unnecessary anguish, distress and dislocation for hundreds of thousands of people living in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst people celebrate today the decision&mdash;the only decision that could be reached&mdash;they also send a message to this government that they will not forget, come the next election, the distress that this government put them through unnecessarily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to pay tribute tonight to the great campaign conducted by the community, by the people of the region. Whilst there are many hundreds of people I could mention, unfortunately time does not permit me to do so. But I particularly mention Mr Jim McGoldrick from the South&hyphen;West Community Alliance, who in the very early stages following this disgraceful decision last May took up the fight on behalf of the residents of Holsworthy, Wattle Grove and other regions and kept at it. His driving force was responsible for petitions and submissions from in excess of 50,000 people, all opposing this airport proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to pay tribute to Phil Smith and his entire team at the Sutherland Environment Centre for their efforts on behalf of the people of the Sutherland shire and Illawarra region in campaigning against this crazy proposal. Their efforts demonstrated that ultimately you can even get a Liberal&hyphen;National Party government to listen to the community. But they should never have had to go through that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6384"> trauma and distress. They should never have had to put in the hours and days and weeks and months of voluntary work in order to convince this government of what everyone else knew was a reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also pay tribute tonight to the former member for Hughes, Robert Tickner, who took this issue up on behalf of the residents of the area, particularly the residents of the Illawarra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are still some issues that have to be resolved. Questions still remain. Why was this decision made last May to include Holsworthy, when all of the evidence that had been put in the past demonstrated that it was just a ludicrous proposition: that there were major environmental concerns; that there were going to be major costs involved in getting rid of the unexploded ordnance; that it would have a major effect on the existing defence establishments at the Holsworthy range; and that it would create social dislocation through the massive noise that would have been generated over the homes of hundreds of thousands of people, people who had moved into this area, invested their life savings, taken out their mortgages, raised their children and developed communities, on the understanding that they were never going to have an airport in that region. Of course, they were deceived by the government at the last election when they were not told what was in store for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about time the government stopped hiding behind their claims of confidentiality and released the information and the advice that has been requested under the freedom of information legislation. They should come clean on just what was the reason that this proposal was put back on the drawing board again. They should come clean on what was the involvement of the Lawrence Hargrave project team; what secret deals were entered into at the time between ministers and the proponents of that proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been tremendous news for the people of south&hyphen;west and southern Sydney and the Sutherland shire in particular&mdash;an area where I have lived all my life, and I declare an interest, of course.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, with the good news, this government has to put in some bad news. On the very same day that they have ruled out an airport at Holsworthy, what have they announced? They have announced that there is going to be a new reactor built at Lucas Heights&mdash;in the middle of probably one of the fastest growing regions of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that when the Lucas Heights establishment was built and opened in the 1950s it was actually in the bush. I used to live in Cronulla in those days, and I can remember my father taking us on an outing for the day to Lucas Heights to have a look at this newfangled technology. It probably took us about half a day to get there and get back, but today I can walk from my place in Engadine, or Yarrawarra, 100 yards up to the top of the hill and I can see the reactor. I can also see thousands of homes that surround it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the people of the area have put up with that reactor and accepted that it was there, and they have done that because they may have bought their homes and moved in after that reactor was built, one thing they will not accept is an arrogant government putting a new reactor into that site. They will never accept that. Just as they have fought and opposed the siting of the airport and have won, they will also fight and oppose and win on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will stand up here again, just as I have done on the Holsworthy issue. I can see that I will be making quite a lot more speeches on the adjournment debate and other occasions on this issue. You have to ask: what is it that this government does not like about the people of the Sutherland shire? Why do they want to give them another reactor? You would think that, in a country the size of Australia, you could find another location if we actually need a new reactor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The McKinnon report in 1992 and even this Senate committee's report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">No time to waste</EMPHASIS> recognises that there are fundamental questions that should be answered as to whether we need a new reactor. Are there alternative technologies that are available? There should be a full public inquiry into this issue before any decision is made. There certainly should be, as has been recommended, a decision on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6385"> a waste repository site made by this government before a new reactor is built. They are the issues that have to be addressed. But what does this government do? It gives some good news to the people and then it gives them the bad news: a new reactor. It is not on, and we are going to stop it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6385"><TITLE>White Paper on Foreign and Trade Policy</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="6385" TIME="7.46 p.m." SPEAKER="Bourne, Sen Vicki" NAMEID="TW4" ELECTORATE="NSW" PARTY="AD" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TW4">Senator BOURNE</NAME><STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(7.46 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The white paper on foreign affairs and trade released by the government last Thursday represents the government's attempts to look beyond election cycles and to try to chart the passage of foreign affairs and trade through the next 15 years. I congratulate them for that. Naturally enough, any paper produced by a government will reflect its ideologies and its world perspective. This paper is no different, but you do not have to read too far into the paper to realise that the government's attitude to foreign affairs is now inward looking, it is conservative and it is defensive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The white paper states that the government's foreign affairs and trade policy is about advancing the interests of Australia and Australians. But what are those values? What is an intrinsic Australian value? How are they developed? Are they enduring? What changes are there to these values, and what influences these changes? I would suggest that Australian values relate to a fair go for all, to justice, to equality and to participation. It is these values that we ought to incorporate in the national interest&mdash;the name of the white paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Four pillars provide the framework for the white paper. The first is that the government gives priority to the Asia-Pacific region but particularly to east Asia, and I think that is a very good thing. The second is the forging of closer relationships with the United States, Japan, Indonesia and China all in that order. The third is the commitment to further trade liberalisation, including strong support for the World Trade Organisation and APEC. I think we have some problems with that. The fourth is the importance of bilateral relationships such as the basic building blocks for effective regional and global strategies with a selective 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> approach to the multilateral agenda. I think that is a problem too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The paper has a dominant and recurring theme of globalisation, trade and investment. Perhaps as a concession to the one member of the advisory panel with an obvious commitment to human rights&mdash;and I am very pleased he was there&mdash;it makes muted reference to Australia's commitment and role on human rights and to the international conventions which support them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the paper makes other statements which question the government's real commitment to such conventions&mdash;statements such as `Australia needs to direct resources and support to those areas of the UN system which most advance Australia's national interests.' I find it rather disturbing that Australia, a founding member of the United Nations, which has played the most significant role in the setting of international standards, especially for human rights, appears to be disengaging from the United Nations at the time when the institution needs the greatest support to meet the challenges of the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent comments by the Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir, that the UN declaration on human rights represented Western values only and should be reviewed if not rewritten was met with opposition from leaders around the world. But the Australian government minister replied that it was unlikely that the declaration of human rights was going to be reviewed. I sincerely hope he is right, but we did not hear any statement from the government that reconfirmed the universality of human rights. I would have thought that would be the first statement that would come up after the statement of Dr Mahathir.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I applaud the government's stated commitment to human rights, but their actions suggest otherwise. The position Australia took that we would not sign the European Union's trade agreement because of its human rights clause did nothing for our international reputation, and it did not advance our national interests either. The white paper should be commended for spelling out a commitment to racial equality and to the elimination of racial 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6386"> discrimination, but a moral commitment to racial inequality is one thing. It is patronising and it is offensive to the region that the paper ends up saying that we are interested in the region for the economic benefits which follow from closer engagement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a dangerous position, and it makes a mockery of the government's commitment while preaching the universality of human rights on the one hand to declare that linking human rights to trade services neither Australia's trade nor its human interests. It also conflicts with the government's stated commitment to the Asia-Pacific region. In a region where growing democratic movements are looking to Australia for leadership and for encouragement, it is not good enough for the government to be recoiling from democratic and human rights principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course the Democrats understand the importance of trade in our relationships with other countries. They are crucial relationships; they do form the basis of some of our domestic policies. But clearly our commitment needs to be defined in more than economic terms. Is the government wise to declare that economic relations in the region are our highest priority? Will the economic growth in east Asia experienced over the last 15 years continue for the next 15 years, particularly at the same speed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are political and economic uncertainties facing this region, not the least being the lack of skilled labour, physical infrastructure&mdash;an institutional weakness&mdash;and environmental degradation. Events on Bougainville and in Cambodia recently are constant reminders of the very fragile nature of once colonised nations engaging in the global economy. It is these very issues that we should be concerned about in our relations with any country, whether it is through bilateral or multilateral forums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I moved a second reading amendment to the  Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Bill , a bill which appropriates funds and issues securities to effect Australia's membership to the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency. MIGA is an institution of the World Bank, and it is designed to foster foreign investment in developing countries by provid 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing insurance against risks and by providing advisory services regarding foreign investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My amendment would have ensured that any Australian company which operated overseas did so in a manner which was consistent with the laws which apply to environmental and occupational health and safety standards in this country. Neither the government nor the opposition supported the amendment, but respect for human rights is an essential factor in any sound business environment, and it is a necessity in the creation of the best possible conditions for investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also disappointed that the diplomatic importance of our aid program was not given more priority in the white paper, particularly given the recent Simons review. Over the last two decades Australian governments have asserted that Australia's destiny lies with Asia, with which closer economic, military and cultural ties must be forged. Despite this though, successive governments have not been able to convince the Australian people or, indeed, Asian governments that Australia is part of this region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this paper places its commitment on the public record, more will have to be practically done to advance this relationship. We have been involved with ASEAN and APEC for some time, and yet we have still to truly develop those relationships. Perhaps more effort should be placed on gaining membership to the ASEM forum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no assessment in the paper which answers the question of what happens if we fail to develop a closer relationship with the Asian region. Is it wise to state so categorically that there are four nations with whom we intend to direct our relations most significantly?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The defining of the United States, whose strategic engagement and commitment underwrite regional stability, can be seen as an outdated and Cold War approach to viewing our relationship with that country. We should also see the point of view that the US represents a threat to the Asian region and to Australia as an economic enemy, particularly in terms of agricultural dumping. Our relationship with the United States should be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6387"> defined more maturely, and not solely in terms of security and of regional stability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument about what the changing shift in power in the Asian region will mean for Australia is not developed. But regional security will come about through upgrading human rights standards and through the democratisation of Asian nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the first foreign affairs and trade white paper that I can remember. The government ought to be congratulated for producing it. It allows those of us outside the government to analyse its policy and commitment to the fundamentals of foreign affairs and trade policy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sugar industry has been significant in the history and development of North Queensland. It has cemented its place in history further in another way&mdash;and that is for its leadership in environmental understanding and management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I want to congratulate cane farmers throughout Queensland who, on their own initiative, are attempting to ensure that their industry becomes more environmentally sustainable. In particular, I congratulate the Mackay Canegrowers in North Queensland for an excellent initiative they have commenced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mackay Canegrowers have shown admirable foresight and environmental responsibility in establishing the Environmental Farmer of the Year Award. This annual award is part of a new system of awards aimed at recognising and rewarding growers in the Mackay cane growing region who manage their farming enterprises to minimise any adverse environmental impacts on their farming activities, and to promote and encourage biodiversity on their farms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After calling for nominations, Mackay Canegrowers carefully whittled away the applicants for the inaugural award down to four. A team of four judges, including repre 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sentatives from the Canegrowers Environmental Advisory Committee, the Mackay Conservation Group, cane grower support organisations, Commercial Union Insurance and the Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations, then visited the farms in mid-June and assessed them according to numerous and rigorous environmental criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These criteria, governing vital on-farm environmental considerations, included record keeping of soil testing and chemical and fertiliser use; erosion control, such as contouring and sediment traps; irrigation management, including the method of irrigation and tailwater management; fertiliser management; harvesting and trash management; pest management; waste disposal; management of original vegetation; and farm and household recycling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After applying this comprehensive testing procedure, the judges determined the winner of the Environmental Farmer of the Year Award to be Plane Creek cane grower, Mr Keith Schmidtke. Mr Schmidtke's victory emphatically shows that with responsible and considerate management primary producers, who have for so long been the backbone of this nation, can successfully grow their product in an environmentally friendly fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Schmidtke's victory is made more meritorious by the significant improvements he has made to his farm since acquiring the 150 hectare property in 1970, and it emphasises the positive changes that are taking effect in farming and land management practices in this country. The property, when he acquired it, was riddled with problems, including eroding gullies and irregularly flowing creeks, and with only a handful of trees lining the creek banks. After a lot of effort, these concerns were addressed, and I am aware that the property now even has tailwater dams to collect farm run-off before it can enter the creek, thus protecting the creek and providing additional water for on-farm irrigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With between 1,200 and 1,300 cane growers in the Mackay region alone, and over nine million tonnes of sugar crushed from this area last year, the significance of such environmental initiatives cannot be, and should not be, underestimated. The more that initiatives 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6388"> such as those adopted by Mackay Canegrowers can be promoted and encouraged, the more winners there are. Not only does the environment benefit in tangible, measurable ways, but evidence is increasingly showing that farm output and quality of output is also improved, making it a win-win situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I applaud the Mackay Canegrowers organisation for establishing this bright initiative which has become part of an annually contested title, with nominations already being called for next year's award. I believe that more organisations can take a leaf out of the Mackay Canegrowers book and follow the excellent and responsible environmental example they have set. For example, there are cane growers who, even in the absence of the opportunity to win an environmental award, are taking their environmental responsibility seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tully cane farmer Mr Ross Digman has planted native forest trees along both the banks of the Tully River and his on&hyphen;property drainage canals. He has set aside part of his land as a native cabinet timber plantation to both diversify his income producing crops and to provide food and habitat for local wildlife. Furthermore, this particular farmer excavated an artificial wetland to replace wetland areas that have been drained in order to reinstate an important fish breeding habitat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Digman has also gone so far as to produce a video outlining his environmental initiatives; this video is available at video outlets in the area dubbed the `sugar coast'. In producing the video, Mr Digman aims to encourage his fellow cane growers to follow his lead not only for the sake of the industry's long&hyphen;term viability but also fro the sake of producing positive environmental outcomes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Environmental initiatives which redress some of the environmental damage of the past should not go unnoticed. Mr Schmidtke and Mr Digman should therefore be roundly congratulated for their efforts, as should the Mackay Canegrowers organisation for establishing the Environmental Farmer of the Year Award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that this award complements the sugar industry's self-initiated environmental audit of 1996. This audit highlighted the need for cane growers to be further educated about the benefits of adopting green practices. Significantly, the Mackay Canegrowers environmental audit not only educates; it rewards.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="8.00 p.m." PAGE="6388"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 8.00 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1 and 2) In relation to Giblett Block, which is on the interim list of the Register of the National Estate, I am aware of investigations conducted during 1995, by the then Minister for Resources into allegations that woodchips had been exported from parts of Giblett Block without proper approvals. However, I understand the former Minister subsequently concluded that it would not be possible to prove any breach of an export licence. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3 and 4) In relation to three year transitional woodchip export licences, I sought the AHC's advice under S30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act on 28 August 1996.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Nearly 60% of the Giblett block is protected under a voluntary undertaking by the Western Australian Government not to log certain areas during 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sourcing of timber from crown lands in Western Australia for supply under export contracts is controlled by the Western Australian Minister for the Environment within the framework of the Deferred Forest Agreement, made between the Commonwealth and Western Australia. This agreement safeguards biodiversity, old growth, wilderness and other environment and heritage values in nominated unreserved areas during the development of a comprehensive adequate and representative reserve system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any timber harvested, whether it is intended to be used domestically or exported, can only be sourced from areas agreed under the DFA as not being potentially required to form part of the `comprehensive, adequate and representative' forest reserve system which will be implemented under a Regional Forest Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transitional licences prohibit exports of woodchips sourced from Deferred Forest Areas on crown land, which were designed to maximise protection of National Estate values. Exports of native hardwood woodchips sourced from National Estate places outside Deferred Forest Areas are allowed under transitional licences (subject to compliance with other licence conditions).</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A brief review of the issues raised by respondents follows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BACKGROUND</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to requests from the governments of USA, Denmark and Thailand for market access for their chicken meat, AQIS conducted a quarantine risk analysis. The commencement of the risk analysis was foreshadowed in a preliminary paper in 1990, which invited industry submissions. A discussion paper on uncooked and cooked chicken meat was published in April 1991 and comments were invited.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several respondents emphasised the need for effort to be made to ensure that poultry processors overseas complied consistently with the cooking and other conditions in the proposed quarantine requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to these concerns, poultry industries have also claimed that the economic impact of imports would harm the domestic industry. An Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) has considered and reported upon this aspect, separate from the quarantine assessment. The IDC advised that, under the proposed AQIS protocol, the economic impact of imports would be unlikely to be so significant as to render current programs inadequate to deal with resultant pressures for industry adjustment. The Minister has encouraged the poultry industry to consider adjustment requirements and present a submission to the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STANDARDS AT POULTRY PROCESSING PREMISES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In assessing foreign plants for approval to export to Australia, AQIS must have regard to standards for construction, equipment and hygienic operation which apply to comparable poultry processing plants in Australia. These domestic standards are the accepted baseline for public health and food safety in Australia. In accordance with obligations under the World Trade Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards, Australia may not impose a stricter standard on imported foods than currently applies to foods produced domestically, having regard to the goal of protecting health.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are presently no uniform Australian regulatory standards for establishments processing poultry meat for domestic consumption. The Council of Commonwealth and State Ministers for Agriculture (ARMCANZ) has determined that aspects of national meat industry Codes of Practice dealing with public health will be mandated by amendment of State and Territory legislation. New standards have been written incorporating the principles of quality assurance, leaving prescriptive sections of the Codes for use as best practice guidelines, either for voluntary application as "recommended methods of compliance" with mandatory Australian Standards or by direct reference in State / Territory legislation.</PARA>

Any consignment that does not meet relevant standards or tests cannot be sold into the Australian market place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NFA has advised AQIS of its requirements for inspection and sampling of cooked chicken meat imports. In brief, every shipment from each supplier is to be inspected and sampled until five satisfactory test results are achieved, when testing frequency for that supplier would reduce to one of every four consignments and ultimately to one in twenty consignments, on a test and hold basis, based on satisfactory compliance with requirements. The NFA has advised that imported cooked chicken meat should be subject to analyses for Salmonella spp, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter spp, antibiotics, and organochlorine/organophosphate

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some respondents questioned whether the risk of adverse environmental impact, in the event that the importation of chicken meat were to result in an outbreak of exotic disease, merited designation of the proposal to import cooked chicken meat in accordance with the provisions of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1975 (EP[IP] Act). Concerns at the potential for any disease outbreak to affect native bird species were also raised in this context.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The EP (IP) Act and the Administrative Procedures made under that Act, require the consideration of whether an action as defined in the legislation is an action which will, or is likely to, affect the environment to a significant extent or which will have the effect of permitting or facilitating an action by another person which will or is likely to result in such an effect. As decisions to permit entry of animal products, made under the Quarantine Act and consistent with Australia's conservative approach to risk, would generally be unlikely to constitute actions leading to significant adverse effects on the environment, the requirements of various environmental legislation would be generally fulfilled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of an importation of a non-viable animal product, such as cooked chicken meat, the potential for harmful impact on the environment clearly relates solely to the risk of entry of unwanted pathogenic organisms which have the potential to cause disease if the pathogen were to establish in susceptible animal populations. Through a formal process comprising technical analysis and consideration of appropriately conservative risk management options, AQIS is satisfied that a decision under the Quarantine Act to permit the importation of cooked chicken meat for human consumption is unlikely to have significant environmental implications. Consequently there is no need to designate a proponent in order to achieve the object of the EP(IP) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AQIS has consulted widely and considers that all quarantine concerns have now been addressed. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proposed import conditions which were attached to AQIS's 1994 position paper have been modified to strengthen certification and verification aspects of the protocol. The 1994 paper has also been reformatted for greater clarity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AQIS will accept comment on the attached draft quarantine requirements until 28 June. After this, comments will be considered and the requirements finalised.</PARA>
