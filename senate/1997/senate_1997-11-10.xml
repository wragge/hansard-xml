<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion before the Senate, as we have just heard, is that the Senate does not insist upon its amendments. The amendments moved by Senator Margetts and supported by the ALP do seek to improve the taxation regime applying to some alcohol products. The ALP supported the amendments in order to demonstrate that whilst we are staunch 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opponents of the GST we are not opposed to sensible taxation reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The taxation regime that applies in Australia for alcoholic products is clearly something that needs to be reviewed. There is a very great variation between the rate of excise that applies to various alcoholic products. Add to this  the differing rates of wholesale sales tax that also apply, and the resultant system is in need of review and reform. I do not say here what the precise outcome should be, but fairer competition between producers and a better deal for consumers are clearly two important objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens (WA) amendment sought to partially address this issue by introducing a new system of excise to apply to ready&hyphen;to&hyphen;drink mixed spirit beverages. The amendment had two aspects: firstly, to broaden the coverage of excise to include beverages using fermented alcohol as well as distilled alcohol as a base, and, secondly, to alter the rate of excise payable on these premixed beverages, that is, those beverages covered by food standard P5, to equate the level of tax for those drinks under five per cent alcohol content with the lower rate of tax applicable to beer. This would have broadened the base and lowered the rate, supposedly the rationale being followed by the government in the tax reform process, but it has been rejected out of hand by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment would have closed a loophole in the  Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997  to stop changes in production methods to avoid tax. It would have given a strong incentive for these beverages to be reduced in alcoholic content below five per cent, thereby reducing the aggregate consumption of alcohol with obvious health and other social benefits hopefully flowing from that. Most importantly, it would have given a great boost to consumers in the form of lower prices on some drinks. It is a policy position which the ALP still supports.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R169">Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997</XREF>  is a bill about competing interests. Effectively, there has been special treatment of designer drinks because they are not traditional alcoholic drinks. Traditionally, alcoholic drinks have been made by fermenting some sort of vegetable product: hops, rye, wheat, rice, grapes, apples, sugarcane, honey, dandelions, elderberry or rhubarb. Sometimes that fermented product has been used directly, sometimes it has been distilled. In either case, the resulting product is one which partakes of the essence of the seed or fruit from which it is made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the hops and the water and the way fermentation occurs which gives beer its flavour. Rhubarb wine is very nice, I have to say. It is the grapes, with all the variability of the soil, the weather for the year, the type of grape, and so on which determines the taste of wine. The same sorts of factors determine the taste of good rums, whiskies or bourbons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, fermented drinks include cider, mead, wine and beer. Spirits are distilled drinks. These are commonly understood terms. Fermented drinks are usually drunk as they are. Spirits are sometimes drunk neat or on ice but can also be mixed with cola, soda, and so on and possibly with other spirits to form cocktails. Nonetheless, the flavour of these drinks is often dependent on the flavour of the spirits added. The new class of drinks is a product of mixing alcohol from which virtually all taste is extracted into what is essentially soft drink or water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alcoholic soda, alcoholic cola and alcoholic lemonade are not drinks on classical lines. The source of alcohol does not matter; the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> point is to create a soda or spring water that will make someone drunk. `The stronger the better' seems to be something of a motto, and many of these drinks are fairly strong. At around 5.5 per cent alcohol, they are therefore stronger than most beer and most common cider. For example, Carlton Cold is 4.9 per cent and Strongbow Dry is 4.7 per cent alcohol content.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not talking about the high strength ciders like e33 that have come out with the designer drinks.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is some argument to be made that these new high potency ciders have come out because of the designer drinks. These new drinks, with their taste completely independent of the alcohol they use, can use alcohol from virtually any source. They can use alcohol from the making of light beer. They can use alcohol from wine or from cider. They are not adding wine or cider or beer to cola; they are adding alcohol that has been purged of its taste. Since they can use alcohol from any source, the differing tax regimes for various sources will play a major part in determining that source.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until recently, the government attempted to tax these drinks as spirits. That does not make a lot of sense, particularly when they contain no quantity of what is commonly defined as spirits. The courts agreed that they were not spirits. The government sought to redefine spirits to be anything with alcohol from a distilled source. The industry changed sources. The outcome is that tax will remain minimal, with some companies able to avoid paying a large part of tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendment was designed to allow these drinks, plus the premixed drinks, to be taxed under a single regime. This also addresses the pressures that have led the makers of premixed spirits to start mixing only traces of true spirits to high quantities of fermented alcohol. Lemon Ruski is a good example: one per cent real vodka is mixed with 4.5 per cent wine sourced alcohol. This is not mixed wine, since all wine flavour was removed to allow it to be marketed as ersatz vodka. I have not tasted it, but I have been told it does not taste much like vodka. It manages to fit into the least tax regime for alcoholic drinks. Likewise, Bundaberg is considering changing their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8547"> premixed drinks to drinks using alcohol primarily sourced in non&hyphen;spirits with a lashing of spirits so they can say it has some in there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is this what the government is aiming for? Our amendment, in treating the class of designer and premixed drinks identically, makes source of alcohol irrelevant, unless a drink is a wine, a beer, a cider or a spirit. Manufacturers can then use the alcohol which is cheapest and sourced closest. I imagine that the beer companies will go back to using the alcohol they generate from making light beer, regardless of how that alcohol is extracted. Bundaberg can go back to using rum. The industry will have to stop chopping and changing to address new tax regimes which leave loopholes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that the tax regime has resulted, and is resulting, in a situation where the industry keeps changing. Whatever calculations may be made about loss of revenue based on the current amount of premixed drinks cannot be based on current production and consumption patterns. Manufacturers are changing production and pushing for consumers to move to their new products. In a couple of years, we will see most premixed drinks made from designer alcohols. The government will lose this revenue anyway. If the government does not change the taxation regime to something like the Greens' model, it will lose even more because the manufacturers will go for the loopholes the government has left.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once you have a classification such as P5, you can tax these drinks under that. You can argue that lemon Ruski is not wine, no matter where the alcohol comes from, and commonsense and ordinary usage of words are on your side. If you do not, you need to say that lemon Ruski is 82 per cent wine and eight per cent spirits. You certainly cannot claim that it is all spirits if it is made from fermented grape alcohol under the current regime or under the proposed government regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you are left with the government arguing against commonsense that lemon Ruski is 82 per cent wine, otherwise there is no regime at all under which it can be taxed. How long will it be before there is an AAT challenge that says it is not `wine' on the ordinary usage of the word? The government will lose 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on the same basis as it lost on `spirit'. At that point we will see the government coming back and probably trying to redefine `wine' to mean `any fermented product'. What does that do to the definition of wine? What does that do to the useful time spent in this chamber?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no way you can juggle the current definitions of traditional drinks to cover, in any consistent way, what is happening in the alcoholic drink industry. What is needed is a new classification under which these drinks, and any new hybrid or mixed alcoholic drinks, clearly fit. Personally, I think the P5 standard works. If you want to create some other definition for mixed drinks other than `wine coolers', fine, but it will not work to try to fiddle with the definitions of traditional drinks&mdash;wine, beer, cider and spirits&mdash;to try to bring these new drinks under one or more of the new regimes. They are not really like traditional drinks, and the changes in the drink market need to be addressed through the creation of a new category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment the Senate passed has an advantage beyond creating a category under which the new drinks can be taxed. This advantage is that there is a two-step regime&mdash;progressive taxation based on alcohol content. What we said is that where a drink contains less than five per cent alcohol it should be taxed at the beer rate. Currently, a number of the designer drinks, and most of the premixed spirit drinks, are above that. Therefore, they would be taxed at the spirit rate, not because they are spirits but because they are P5 and of higher alcohol content which is similar to premixed spirit drinks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think one of the big outcomes will be that many makers of designer drinks will bring the alcohol content down. Since these drinks are mainly marketed to young people, I think that would be a good thing. It is socially worth while, and I understand that about 80 per cent of the premixed drinks would also be brought down below five per cent. I think that is a good thing too, and I do not buy the argument that in the interests of tax revenue people should drink more alcohol. Revenue is not the bottom line. We need to consider the social impacts of what we are doing. This is why I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8548"> was arguing in relation to the `Charter of Budget Dishonesty Bill'. The budget bottom line is not the only criteria on which we should be making policy. It certainly is one factor, but I do not see it as the prime factor. Funnily enough, I think we have some other values in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the social factors, I would like to point out that Peter Holland, of 6WF in Perth, interviewed Chris MacDonald of the Western Australian Institute of Alcohol and Other Drugs. During the interview, Mr MacDonald said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some research a while back indicated that when people over 18 were asked how often they drank those drinks&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, designer colas and soft drinks with alcohol&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it was only about 3&hyphen;5% of the drinking population who drank them. So primarily they were people who were under the age of 18 who appeared to be drinking them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Whether or not this research was accurate, there is no doubt that the market for these drinks is certainly for people under 30, and mainly for those under 25. I would say that the younger the drinker the more likely they are to be drinking these drinks. In such a case, I cannot understand why they should be higher in alcohol content than beer or traditional cider. We are not only encouraging young people to drink but to drink strong drinks. This is the basis for the support the Senate amendment has attracted from health organisations concerned with substance abuse. Mr MacDonald went on to make this point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't necessarily want to see increases in prices for consumers, but we know that young people are very price sensitive, more than any other group, any other consumer group.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In talking of some research on price impacts, he said this about the research:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . talked about if the price of a 6 pack of beer was raised by 20 or 30 cents, it would have the impact on young people, the equivalent effect of raising the drinking age by 1 year in terms of the amount of alcohol that was consumed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These are some of the factors behind the health non-government organisations supporting the Senate amendment. Of course, this means less gross domestic product and less tax, but that simply highlights the fact that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> gross domestic product and tax revenue are not indicators of social good. It also highlights the fact that the true cost benefit is not considered. Reduced youth alcohol consumption would result in less crime, less road accidents and road trauma, and less trouble for young people with the police. What does that cost on an annual basis? All of that translates into savings in economic terms, although all of these reduce gross domestic product. They are added in in terms of work that is done but the actual social cost is not taken away from the gross domestic product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard today that the Labor Party is not going to insist on the Senate's amendments. Senator Cook has indicated that the reason for that is that the government may withdraw the bill and not get any revenue at all. I think that would be ludicrous action on behalf of the government. I believe there are very narrow interests being represented here, and I believe the government has created for itself a further headache. There is no doubt about the fact that the government would deserve censure for the time that would be taken up in the chamber debating these headaches that it will continue to create in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party is taking this attitude: we have given the government the chance to adopt reasonable legislation. If it stubbornly refuses to do so, it is not the job of the Senate to fix up the bad legislation of government. I have to say I differ on this. I think fixing poor legislation is exactly our job. That is the function of this place. We are not just here to make political points. It is the function of the Senate far more than the function of the House of Representatives which, because of numbers and party discipline, has no capacity to affect legislation at all and can only be a forum for political point scoring. The Senate, happily, has more voting power than that, which is why debate here is often more considered, frequently more polite and more to the point. The Greens will insist on our amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the reasons that have just been outlined by Senator Margetts, I initially voted for her amendments to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R169">Excise Tariff 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8549"> Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997</XREF> . I have always been one to believe that the decision of the government should have as its base the excisability on the level of alcohol content rather than the derivation of the manufacture of the drinks, whether that is fermentation or distillation. I have strongly been of that opinion for many years. I was pleased when Senator Margetts moved her amendments when the bill was first before us and I was very happy to support them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill, as has been acknowledged I think pretty well around the chamber, ensures that the proportion of a beverage that is distilled alcohol will be subject to excise. The taxation of beverages in the P5 food standards is anomalous and this bill presents an opportunity to correct that. That opportunity was grasped by the amendments. Producers will simply substitute fermented alcohol for distilled alcohol, eroding collections by the Commonwealth. The high alcohol content drinks based on fermented alcohol will continue to be non-excisable and, as indicated by Senator Margetts, will be more attractive to young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, however, is insisting upon its legislation. I would like to raise with the minister a point made by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee in its consideration of the  Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 . Page 12 of that report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS that the bill be passed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> . . . the Committee agrees that any loophole in the principal legislation that allowed a class of alcoholic beverage to escape the revenue net should be closed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However the Committee noted a number of serious concerns raised by the industry about differing tax treatments of alcohol according to the production method used. This tax treatment also has social consequences as set out earlier in the report. The committee recommends that these matters should be the subject of an immediate review by government and that a review should look at the equity of tax treatment between RTD products and designer drinks in the P5 category particular reference to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the social effect on consumption patterns caused by the differential taxation treatment according to the production method of the alcohol;  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Potential loss of government revenue with a change to the use of different forms of alcohol (other than distilled spirits) in RTD products; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The possibility of introducing common taxation treatment for RTD products with an alcohol content of 5% or less and those above 5%.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I want to know&mdash;and I am sure you, Mr Temporary Chairman Ferguson, being the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee would like to know&mdash;precisely what the government is going to do about those recommendations if it is going to insist upon its bill. I heard Senator Murray interject a while ago, `What is it going to do about the recommendations that have emerged from that committee?' I think we would all be very interested in this if the government is going insist upon its bill and reject the amendments that have been put forward by Senator Margetts and adopted, might I say, by the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leads me to my final point. Senator Cook indicated that the Labor Party still supports the amendments that were adopted by the Senate, but he seemed to indicate that the Labor Party would not support them now because it was concerned that the government might drop the whole legislation and thus forgo a considerable amount of excise tax. I have been here for 22 years and that is the first time I have heard that argument put forward for actions&mdash;`because the government might forgo some tax'. I really cannot recall the last time the government had forgone tax of whatever complexion. If it chose to do so, it would be because it did trumpet it as an election commitment or something of that order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just simply wish to advise the committee that I am opposing the motion proposed by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) on behalf of the government. I am supporting the bill as it was amended by the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are three issues, which have been well expressed by Senators Margetts and Harradine. The first issue is that of economics. If we as a chamber accede to the government's motion to reject our own 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8550"> amendments, then we will be encouraging imports, we will be encouraging substitution and we will be encouraging a worse position for Australia than we would enjoy if the amendments were passed. Secondly, the encouragement of the amendments to push the alcohol level for measured drinks, ready-to-drink drinks, below five per cent is an extremely useful social mechanism. It is one the government has spurned and spurned wrongly. The third issue is that of imposing an excise on alcoholic products which are presently excise free. Excuse us for being consistent here: isn't the purpose of having an excise on alcoholic drinks that they should be consistent, that they should be applied and that they should contribute to a measure of price stability and to a measure of certainty in the consumption of alcoholic products?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that we have a new minister in this portfolio in the other House, the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss). When the minister presented the reasons from the Committee of Reasons&mdash;that sounds an interesting committee&mdash;he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee has worked very quickly. On behalf of the committee appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing to the amendments of the Senate . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I for one wish that they had worked a bit slower. I am not convinced that they have had good advice or that they have really come to grips with the issues which were very well worked through by our Senate Economics Legislation Committee&mdash;of which you, Mr Temporary Chairman Ferguson, are the distinguished chairman and, might I say, a very good chair. One of the two recommendations made by our committee was unanimously supported. In other words, senators from the National Party, the Liberal Party, the Independents, the two Greens, the Australian Democrats and the Labor Party who were members of the committee agreed on the matter. But, no, the executive and Customs in their wisdom do not like unanimous agreement on issues from the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As it stands, the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1), fails to rectify a tax anomaly which is perpetuating the growth in designer drinks that do not incur any excise duty&mdash;and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that will be the consequence. The taxation of beverages in the P5 category is anomalous. The government simply want to ensure that the proportion of a beverage composed of distilled alcohol be made subject to excise and to leave off the issue of fermented alcohol. They want to do this even though their bill will provide a competitive advantage in terms of excise duties for ready-to-drink products containing fermented alcohol as distinct from distilled alcohol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those of you who have never had a drop of alcohol touch their lips&mdash;and I am sure there must be a few in the chamber&mdash;I will remind you that distilled alcohol has the very same physiological effect as does fermented alcohol. It is a remarkable feature but it is true. Quite frankly, it is foolish to have different rates of excise for these two kinds of alcohol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence has been presented to the committee showing that many drinks of this type, which are already on the market, are imported from New Zealand. I am sure it is very helpful to our neighbours for us to encourage more imports from New Zealand, but I thought our balance of trade was something that we should pay attention to. In a small measure, Senator Margetts's amendments did deliver a helpful kick along to our balance of trade in this area but, no, the government would prefer to encourage the imports from New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Domestic manufacturers, such as the distillers, who appeared before the committee told us on oath that they will be encouraged to substitute fermented alcohol for distilled alcohol in so-called ready&hyphen;to&hyphen;drink or premixed beverages in order to minimise tax. Because those manufacturers do not have brewing facilities at their plants, they will be encouraged to import fermented products from overseas. In time, this will have a negative impact on Australian investment and will result in significant revenue losses. We were advised that, if substitution occurs, we could face a revenue loss&mdash;as a result of this motion moved by the minister&mdash;of about $30 million over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Then there is the failure to impose an incentive to lower alcohol beverages. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8551"> issue is of significant concern to health and community organisations, a number of whom made submissions to the Senate committee inquiry on this point. Those of you who have been in the chamber longer than I have will know that a number of those organisations have consistently pursued this theme in previous committee reports on these matters. They want drinks taxed progressively in accordance with their level of alcohol and not in accordance with the method of production. It does not matter a row of beans to anyone who is consuming alcohol whether it comes from distilled or fermented alcohol. What matters is the effect. That is what health and community organisations attend to and that is what Senator Margetts's amendments attended to. Those organisations saw the amendments as important from a health perspective because it would encourage moderate and responsible alcohol consumption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only one industry player has come back to complain about the Senate's amendments and, unfortunately, that one industry player looms far too large in the government's consideration of this matter. The government should have ignored that industry player and done the right thing. I regret that Customs has given bad advice on this matter to the minister or, alternatively, that the minister has ignored good advice and has decided to insist on the bill as it was previously put.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all thought Senator Margetts's amendments were helpful on issues of revenue, public policy, health and economics. Accordingly, the Australian Democrats record that they will continue to insist on the amendments and to oppose the minister's motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their contributions. The original purpose&mdash;and it is still the purpose&mdash;of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R169">Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997</XREF>  is to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages which contain distilled alcohol, including spirits, regardless of their alcohol content.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In November 1994, Carlton and United Breweries commenced the manufacture of the product known as Subzero, an alcoholic soda 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which had an alcohol content of approximately 5.5 per cent. The Australian Customs Service considered Subzero excisable under subitem 2(H) of the schedule to the Excise Tariff Act as a spirituous beverage. Carlton and United Breweries appealed the decision of the ACS to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 7 June 1996, the AAT determined that the product Subzero had such a low alcohol content by volume that it could not be described as spirituous and was, therefore, non&hyphen;excisable under subitem 2(H). The decision was based on what the AAT considered is commonly regarded as the definition of `spirit' in the community&mdash;that is, a strong alcoholic liquor, usually containing not less than 37 per cent alcohol by volume. The matter is still subject to appeal to the full Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its original form, the bill sought to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921, in effect to maintain the status quo with the legislation. The Senate amendments seek to impose the beer rate of excise on any product in the National Food Authority's standard P5. This amendment will have a twofold effect on alcoholic beverages in the P5 category with an alcohol content of less than five per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rate of excise on spirit based premixed drinks in the P5 category will fall from $36.99 per litre of alcohol, to $15.89 per litre of alcohol. For the first time, excise will be imposed on other alcoholic products in the P5 category not currently subject to excise. It is apparent that the intention of the Senate amendments is to reduce the disparity in the taxation of alcoholic products by reducing the excise payable on highly taxed spirit based products and, for the first time, to impose excise on currently excise&hyphen;free beverages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government remains of the view that the bill as originally introduced should not be amended. I note that the ALP will not insist on the amendments. I also note that in Senator Harradine's contribution he raised the point that the committee report had agreed that any loopholes should be closed. This also basically supports the view taken to some degree by Senator Cook and to a wider degree by the government, in that we recognise that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8552"> the whole taxation regime should be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons we recognise that should happen&mdash;and I think the general public at large wants that to happen&mdash;is that, to a large extent, much of the taxation act, apart from being complicated, is illogical. In response to Senator Harradine, I say that I will draw to the attention of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) that the matter raised in the committee report should be part of the overall review of taxation that the government is undertaking.</PARA></SPEECH>

I thank the minister for indicating that a review will be undertaken, presumably by a committee under the chairmanship of Senator Gibson. We understand that, and that is very important. The other matters that the committee raised and noted were the issues that I referred to: the tax treatment will have social consequences, as set out in the report, and the need for an immediate review. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to say immediately that the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill has been misnamed. If the government insists that this bill not pass, it would have to be renamed, to be consistent, the Charter of Budget Dishonesty Bill. It would produce an outcome which would dishonestly represent what the true position was to the taxpayers and voters of Australia. This motion, that the government does not oppose the sensible amendments agreed to by the Senate, has therefore got to be seen as a political stunt. Contrary to the opposition, the government does not want to entrench a superior system of accountability within this legislation. It just wants the appearance of reform, not the fact of reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point to make in considering the Senate amendments is that the government also succeeded in stopping two very important amendments that would have improved the legislation even further. Let me mention what they were. The first is the requirement that the charter be legally binding. This legislation is not enforceable through the courts. In addition, there are no penalties for non&hyphen;compliance. The Senate attempted to make the charter enforceable but the government refused to accept that position. The government has insisted that this charter is, in fact, an optional charter. It is an optional charter of budget honesty, which makes a farce of the government's rhetoric in this area. In making this point on this very subject, I acknowledge the contribution of Senator Andrew Murray who has also made this point, often with greater force than I have. Nonetheless, I endorse it entirely.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8556">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second unsuccessful amendment in the Senate was our proposal for the budget documents to contain an estimate of the effect of budget measures on national savings. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) has repeatedly told us&mdash;and it has been repeated here in the Senate&mdash;that the overriding objective of budget policy is to increase the level of national savings. Surely, in legislation that is supposed to improve budget transparency, it is not unreasonable that the government be asked to attempt to quantify the effect of its budget in achieving a key objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the government succeeded in excluding this key measure from the legislation. You could ask the question: what are they afraid of? Labor is perfectly happy to have such information included in budget documentation. Why is the government so opposed to such a fundamental proposition? What is the Treasurer so afraid of? Why shouldn't the public be able to know what the effects of the budget are on national savings? And why shouldn't the Treasurer be held accountable for whatever targets are included? It has to be said that the government has no answers to these questions, and hence has no credibility at all in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 10 amendments that the Senate carried to this bill, and I want to say a few things about them. Amendment No. 1 is fundamentally important in terms of the objectives of the government. The opposition believes that fiscal policy should be directed to worthwhile community goals; it should not be just about accounting outcomes. Why do governments set fiscal objectives? They do so&mdash;or they should do so&mdash;to ensure that their broader objectives can be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senate amendment No. 1 proposes to add to the principles of sound fiscal management in clause 5. We consider that, at a minimum, two further paragraphs should be added to these principles. The amendment requires the government to have regard to, firstly, the achievement of full employment in Australia and, secondly, the overall economic prosperity of the welfare of the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say that a charter of budget honesty should bring out the implications of economic policy for the people of Australia at election 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> time. Clearly, the electors want to know, among other things, how it will impact on the achievement of full employment. Joe Blow, the elector out there, will want to know that. He will also want to know how the budgetary situation and the promises made by the contending parties impact on the overall economic prosperity of the welfare of the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To exclude them is to deny access to that knowledge through this process by the electors. It seems to me to be an exercise in misinformation rather than about transparency, which this is supposed to be about. Many people will recognise that the principles I have mentioned are contained within the Reserve Bank legislation, which the bank must take into account in the conduct of monetary policy in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also add a humanising element to the principles of sound fiscal management rather than there being a narrowly focused fixation on the bottom line and accounting standards, as the bill currently contains. It is not merely appropriate that a statement of principles of fiscal management simply addresses the accounting criteria; it should also recognise that the application of fiscal management techniques has a very real impact on the lives and welfare of people. That is the fundamental point here: putting up a set of accounting outcomes but not explaining what they mean to human beings is a sterile exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For people's welfare to be enhanced and for their prosperity to increase, there has to be a focus on the achievement of full employment and on the economic wellbeing of Australians. The pursuit of better employment outcomes should be the key priority of the government. Unfortunately, we know that this has not been the case&mdash;or, if it has been, the government has been a woeful failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The record since the last budget continues this awful trend. Let me give you some figures. The Australian economy has actually lost around 4,500 full&hyphen;time jobs since budget time&mdash;that is, we have not even stayed still on the jobs front; Australia has actually gone backwards. The government created an employment committee of cabinet to supposedly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8557"> focus policy on employment. That has to be marked down as a spectacular failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments seek to compel the government to focus on national welfare, which they are obviously not doing at the moment. I regard it as unbelievable that the government will not accept this amendment; to do so indicates that they do not support improved employment and national welfare outcomes. That was a fundamental amendment of ours that the Senate carried which the government now want to turn over. That is a very important reason why we will not support the motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the second amendment the Senate carried, which was a very important amendment. One hopes that this will have the unanimous support again of the Senate. The integrity of the tax base is fundamental to the delivery of adequate public services. Taxes are necessary to finance public services, and these are most fairly raised when everyone so able to contributes to them. Ensuring the integrity of the tax base is therefore crucial to ensure that all taxpayers are paying their fair share. The second amendment the Senate made requires the Commissioner of Taxation and the Secretary to the Treasury to provide a report on any material threats to the integrity of the tax system, including the fiscal impact of any of those threats, as a permanent and integral part of fiscal reporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very important proposal because it will allow the government, and especially the Treasurer, to be held accountable for the conduct of tax policy. The opposition believes that there can be few duties of higher importance to the Treasurer than maintaining a fair tax system. Critical to that is that the current tax base be maintained. We are concerned to ensure that the revenue involved is made public to enable scrutiny of the Treasurer's performance in his duty of protecting the public revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax commissioner can advise the Treasurer on matters that should be undertaken to maintain the tax base, but he has no power to force the Treasurer to act in the national interest. The discretion is all with the Treasurer to either accept or reject the advice of the tax office and the Treasury, all in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> comfortable secrecy. By this amendment we do not seek to alter the Treasurer's right to make tax policy on behalf of the government, but we do seek to ensure that material threats to the taxation system are codified in a systematic public basis so as to enable the performance of the Treasurer, in dealing with these revenue threats, to be openly evaluated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Future Treasurers will still be able to refuse to act on the advice of the revenue authorities, but they will not be able to hide their actions, or lack of action, from the Australian people. Clause 12 of schedule 1 is currently worded to include only some references to the sorts of risks that may have a material effect on the fiscal outlook. There is no explicit reference to particular threats proposed to fiscal outcomes due to the integrity of the tax system coming under sustained attack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this was last debated in the Senate&mdash;and I am pleased that he is here representing the government&mdash;Senator Kemp made two ludicrous claims: firstly, that the few pages of information in the statement of risks in Budget Paper No. 1 actually cover the issue. That is rubbish. What we envisage is that this independent statement by the bureaucrats will provide much more detail on specific schemes and issues which will complement the broad information already provided. Secondly, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman: Senator Kemp, you made the ludicrous proposal that the publication of information about schemes or other threats to the tax base will in fact increase their use. As I recall, you put out a press release on this point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax office does not dream up theoretical schemes. The tax office and Treasury detect taxpayer behaviour, often many years after it has become established practice, and then advise the government of the problem and the possible solutions. It is simply wrong to suggest that the tax office could advise the taxation industry on ways to avoid tax; the contrary is the case. If this principle were correct then the tax office should never take any taxpayers to court.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8558"> Chairman, to listen to this point. If your principle was correct then the tax office should never take anyone to court, on the basis that a loss in the courts would alert taxpayers to possible schemes. Clearly that is utterly at odds with current practice. What we do know though is that the tax system, under threat to its integrity, suffers constant and sustained attack. In some instances this is a direct result of government legislation opening up loop&hyphen;holes such as the family trust losses changes which were debated last week. In other cases it arises through a lack of action on tax avoidance; through allowing such things as salary repackaging by senior public servants. As we believe that risks to the integrity of the tax system will always exist, the opposition is convinced that one way of ensuring that these are properly dealt with by the Treasurer is to ensure that the government can be held accountable for inaction. This amendment achieves that goal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn now to amendment No. 3. This amendment changes the frequency of the intergenerational fiscal reports from five years to three years. It was moved by the Democrats but was supported by Labor. This sensible reform ensures that there will be such a report during every normal term of parliament. This reporting framework of three years aligns with the other long&hyphen;term fiscal report which is presented to this parliament, namely, the report by the Government Actuary into the long&hyphen;term costs of the Commonwealth civilian and military superannuation funds. These reports are prepared every three years and we consider this to be an appropriate interval for updated reports to be released.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments Nos 4 and 5 seek to replace and improve the proposed provisions for a pre&hyphen;election economic and fiscal outlook report being published prior to an election. The bill proposes that, within 10 days of the issue of writs for an election, the responsible economic bureaucrats produce a report to inform the electorate of the fiscal and economic outlook after the election. The amendment proposes that, instead of waiting until an election is called, the report should be published two years and nine months after the first day of sitting of a new parliament or, if 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an election is called prior to that time, that the report be produced within five days and not 10.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition moved this amendment for the very simple reason that, if a pre&hyphen;election economic and fiscal report is to be published, then for it to be useful and to contribute towards public debate in the context of an election campaign it needs to be timely and available as soon as the election is called. It should not just be used as a political tactic by the government of the day in order to advance its own political agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am going to run out of time to cover all of the amendments. I will not have time to conclude on 8, 9 and 10, but amendments Nos 6 and 7 involve minor rewriting of the proposed costings regime in the current bill and, in the opposition's view, involve some key and fundamental aspects of the costing regime proposed. They should go ahead. On amendment No. 8, we seek to amend the bill to remove from the Prime Minister the discretion, granted in clause 29 of the bill, to decline a request from the opposition for a costing to be made by the relevant departmental secretary, and to eliminate the proposal that the Prime Minister should be given a copy of the opposition policies. That is a fairly fundamental change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In amendment No. 9 we add some new subclauses, 29(6) and 29(7), which will grant the responsible secretaries a discretion to decline to provide advice that would include policy advice. Amendment No. 10, the final amendment, again by the Democrats, is for the assumptions upon which costings have been made to be spelled out when a costing is provided. Again, we support that.</PARA></SPEECH>

What was a fundamental error from Senator Cook was that the Charter of Budget Honesty is designed, of course, to ensure that governments are up&hyphen;front, as they were not prior to the last election, among other things with the fiscal position of the budget as it is when we go into an election period.

This bill is designed to, in a sense, place restrictions on government. What Senator Cook has done is to attempt to advantage the opposition out of this policy position; hence a number of the amendments which he referred to are designed essentially to benefit the opposition.

This bill is designed to ensure greater transparency. Unlike Senator Cook, we welcome comments that Senator Murray has made on the importance of this bill.

I think you would also regret the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R425">Charter of Budget Honesty Bill</XREF>  not being enforceable.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been so perplexed&mdash;and, as you would know, I disagree with Senator Margetts on this matter&mdash;by a bill coming to us which is unenforceable that I have had to ask you some questions on notice concerning it. Persons who have been in this chamber and in this parliament longer than I might be able to tell me, but I am not aware that there can be or should be an act which is incapable of being enforced. I draw the attention of senators in the chamber to page 27 of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> in which I have put questions on notice to the Minister Representing the Treasurer (Senator Kemp) concerning these matters. I want to know, out of all the hundreds&mdash;I presume it is thousands&mdash;of federal acts we have, how many are unenforceable and in which parts? I want to know what would happen if the Charter of Budget Honesty Act were not complied with. Would the minister say, `Whoops, terribly sorry, I was dishonest, but what can you do about it?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to know how parliament and the public can enforce the act. I have also asked in those questions on notice for any advice as to the validity of the bill in the absence of enforceable rights or duties and whether a copy of that advice can be required. Minister, I remain perplexed on those matters. Having said that, I continue to be a very strong supporter of your bill. I am glad you have introduced it. But I must also indicate to you that I continue to be a very strong supporter of the amendments which were passed by the Senate on this matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to support the questions that have been put to the minister by the Australian Democrats spokesman, Senator Murray, who has just resumed his seat. Senator Murray has done this chamber and the people of Australia a service by inquiring intelligently of the government what other bills bar this&mdash;what other acts bar this&mdash;would not be enforceable? I do await with baited breath a cogent list of such bills from the minister, although I must say my expectation of getting one outstrips my belief of the likelihood of it occurring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say a couple of things too, since the minister has spoken in direct reply to the remarks I made. With the greatest of respect to you, Minister, I have to say that this is the sort of behaviour that gives politicians a bad name. No wonder people in Australia are cynical about politicians when we see performances such as the one that we saw just a moment ago. There is a fundamental and basically cynical and manipulative view that, if you repeat something often enough, it assumes its own truth and then all you have to do is keep repeating it. Because it has been said often enough, there is a tendency for people to believe it might have some substance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we heard from you, Minister, with the greatest respect to you, is the repetition of a number of half truths or mistruths in the belief that, by continuing to repeat them and by people continuing to hear them, they might develop some credence. Well, they do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us get a few of the facts clearly on the table.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate amended this bill not to advantage the opposition but to make it fair and reasonable. It was amended so that the man or woman in the street could say, `That's a fair shake for both of the major political parties. We're coming up to an election. We want to know what the true costs of their promises are. We want that arbitrated on by the Department of Treasury and the Depart 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment of Finance, by the specialist bureaucrats, and not interfered with by politicians.' Prior to an election, the people of Australia want to see what the bureaucrats believe the implications are and that this not be interfered with by politicians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the amendments the Senate made which you are now wanting to turn over is that the opposition has to give a copy of its policies to the Prime Minister and he will then choose to pass on what he wishes to the bureaucrats for costing and pretend that that is the opposition's position. You might like to tell us why you think that is fair. Don't come back, Minister, if I can anticipate you, with the blather that you came back with before that there are forms and conventions and therefore the Prime Minister is the only one who can direct the Public Service. The Senate heard you on that last time and wrote an amendment, which originated from a suggestion by Senator Harradine, which overcame that problem. That amendment removes the problem of direction by the parliament of the Public Service. It removes the problem that hitherto only ministers sworn in by the Governor-General can direct the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But you now want to go back and change that. You want to change it back to a situation in which the Prime Minister will see up&hyphen;front what the opposition's policies are and, if he wishes to, select from them what he wants to pass on for costing, borrow from them what he wants to use for himself or do whatever he wants to do. You have not answered the question as to why you want to change back to that situation. If people want to know what is fair about this bill, they will want to know why the opposition has to have the Prime Minister interfere with its promises in order to get a costing of them. That is another question you might care to answer.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All the questions that you have raised have been canvassed very extensively in the debate. Senator Murray has put down a range of questions. Senator Murray, we are, as you would expect us to do, rapidly preparing you answers to that. I have a draft here which we are still checking, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8562"> but we will provide you with a list which will show fairly clearly, at least on the advice I have, that this bill, in the way you expressed it, is not without precedent in this chamber.

So there will be an answer to those questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no answer, regrettably, to the question that other people may ask as to the hypocrisy of the Labor Party. It is just awesome that Senator Cook should stand up here and attempt to lecture the government while completely forgetting that this bill had its genesis in the disgraceful behaviour of the Keating government, of which he was a minister. Let us remember the history. Prior to the election, Mr Keating and Mr Willis apparently did not have additional figures that they could give to the Australian public to show the state of the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funnily enough, after the election Monday the figures were presented to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. You had the figures and you hid them, and you were part of that government. So don't you get up here and lecture others. We have put a bill before this parliament which will stop such behaviour by the likes of you and your colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are attempting to move a whole host of amendments, some of which are unnecessary, some of which complicate the bill and some of which are already covered in the bill. Whilst reiterating what I have said, Senator Murray has said&mdash;and at least, Senator Murray, you are straightforward&mdash;first of all, that this is a very important bill and, secondly, that the amendments that have been moved advantage the opposition. That is correct. That is exactly what I have been saying. That is what the Labor Party has been doing. But we rest on the fact that this is a bill on which we went to the election. We stated that this was a promise, and this bill gives effect to that promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has moved a whole host of amendments which, I regret to say, have been supported in the Senate by a majority. They are amendments which for a variety of rea 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sons are simply not acceptable to us. In the first place, quite a number of them unduly complicate the bill and are not needed. Secondly, we are worried about the effect that these amendments may have on the typical conventions between public servants, governments and oppositions. Naturally, we are concerned about that. Some of them we think are just plain unworkable. We are not going to accept these amendments. We have had an excellent debate on them.

As the request for the costing of unannounced policies would be permitted, requests could be made for a range of alternative policy options to be costed.

If they are public policies you wish to have costed, you can pass them to the Prime Minister, who can then pass them to the departments.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8564"> with regard to the nursing home up&hyphen;front bonds, did the Prime Minister say, `This measure is a very desirable long&hyphen;term reform'? Did he also say, `The fundamentals of the policy are right'? Minister, why did the Prime Minister not take his latest version on nursing home bonds to cabinet? Is it a fact that the decision regarding this backdown was taken without the benefit of any departmental submissions or papers? Is it also a fact that the Prime Minister merely telephoned a few of his close colleagues to get a clearance for this policy reversal? Why was the Prime Minister unable to answer detailed questions about his latest proposals, and why is he still unable to answer them?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="8564" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister was reflecting the fact that the sector is badly in need of capital. There is no doubt that it was significantly run down under Labor. I did not think there was any dispute about the fact that an answer needs to be found to enable the upgrading of the quality of care that we would expect for all Australians that enter nursing homes. That is basically what the Prime Minister was saying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess our mistake was to copy Labor's solution, because Labor's solution in relation to hostels was to apply bonds. I guess, on reflection, we are better aware that there are different circumstances in relation to nursing homes and bonds. As a result of that, we have decided to withdraw from that previous policy position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position remains, of course, that there is a need for a capital inflow in the sector, and that is why the Prime Minister has put down the alternative of, in effect, the payment of a capital sum of money. We believe that that will achieve the same outcomes and achieve them without the necessity for any aged person to have to sell their home to do so. Undertakings have been given in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to process, I would not have thought it would be any surprise to Senator Faulkner to know that this matter was looked at in great depth within government and that careful consideration was given before the announcement by the Prime Minister. It is true that there were aspects of detail that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> needed to be further worked up and, in fact, some of those details are still being worked up, but it was believed important not to delay the announcement in relation to the bonds vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis the capital contribution. I think aged Australia applauds the Prime Minister for making the decision when he did rather than delaying it until all the fine detail was finally concluded. We hope to be able to put down all of that detail as soon as possible, but in the meantime we are pleased that we have been able to assure the aged of Australia that they can not only get the care that they would have got in the past under Labor but better quality care as a result of their making a contribution to the capital costs&mdash;when they can afford to do so&mdash;of the nursing home sector.</PARA></ANSWER>

Could the governor be reflecting on the fact that this is due to Australia enjoying record low inflation, record low interest rates, record home affordability, record booming retail sales, increasing business investment and now reducing unemployment?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly. I appreciate the question because, yes, there is a contrast between sound economic management under this government and the economic mess that we inherited from Labor&mdash;a more than $10 billion deficit. Senator Cook did not even know that it existed&mdash;he did not even know that his government was $10 billion in the red. But, yes, the importance of taking those hard decisions and putting the economy in a stronger state has certainly been demonstrated in recent times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that the Governor of the Reserve Bank is making is that the economy is in a better position to withstand these pressures now than at any time in the last 25 years. There is a real message in there for the Australian people that they have a government that is determined to adopt economic principles that will withstand any stresses that might occur within the region.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All this has been achieved in just 18 months of good government, adopting sound economic principles. What a contrast from the economic mess that we inherited. It demonstrates that it is worthwhile to take those hard decisions and to face up to the need to constrain expenditure to get the fundamentals right, and then all Australians can benefit from what flows therefrom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are right again, Senator Coonan: particularly small business. Small business is the engine room for growth, for jobs and for families.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Ferris for her question. Yes, the government is strongly committed to the reconciliation process. We were at the beginning, when the Reconciliation Council was established, and we have continued to be so. I also believe that within the community there is a belief that more can be achieved than we have to date. I also believe that reconciliation must 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8567"> grow from the community level and that this government will promote that growth. In fact, I have spoken on this matter on many occasions outside the Senate. It is something that I believe in very strongly, but we must not lose sight of the fact that Australia is a decent and harmonious nation based on fairness, on tolerance and mutual respect, and on an appreciation of racial and cultural diversity. This government is committed to upholding these values and is totally committed to continuing the reconciliation process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am extremely disappointed in some who have sought to turn the process into a political football in recent days.

It is far too precious to see it damaged in that way, and I would repeat what I said on Friday in a statement released to the media:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a nation we simply cannot afford to have reconciliation damaged in the political arena . . . I ask those who have been politicising this issue to stop and think seriously about the implications of their actions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The facts are fairly straightforward. The government strongly encouraged Patrick Dodson to continue as chairman of the council. Despite that, he wrote to me on Thursday, 30 October and then verbally, on a number of occasions over the following four days, repeated that he did not want reappointment. It was fully a week after I received his written decision not to seek reappointment that Mr Dodson wrote saying he had changed his mind. By that time, we had already approached someone else to be our nominee for the position and she had accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evelyn Scott is an outstanding Australian. Ms Scott has been involved in Aboriginal affairs for over 30 years and, during that time, has made an outstanding practical contribution to reconciliation through her life work.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I firmly believe that there are three essential elements in achieving a lasting reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. First, there needs to be a shared commitment to overcoming indigenous disadvantage and providing equality of opportunity for all Australians. Second, there needs to be an honest and realistic acknowledgment of the injustices of the past. Third, there needs to be a mutual acceptance of the importance of working together in ensuring that our differences do not prevent us from sharing equally in a common future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Justice. My question relates to the Howard government's major attack on the illegal drugs trade in Australia. How will the `tough on drugs' initiative assist the fight against drugs which is causing so much concern in our community?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Ferguson for the question. The Prime Minister, in announcing the `tough on drugs' initiative, made it very clear that the Commonwealth and this government intends to take a lead in the war against illicit drugs, the menace facing so many Australian families. In doing so, the Prime Minister underlined the need for state governments to work cooperatively with the Commonwealth government and for law enforcement agencies around Australia and internationally to work together. It has certainly been made clear that cooperation is without a doubt the most effective way forward in law enforcement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Drugs and the drug barons do not recognise state boundaries, nor do they recognise national boundaries. It is a slim hope held by a naive few to imagine that focusing on the efforts of one particular agency will ever have a chance of being effective in this battle. We saw on the weekend an example of just how effective law enforcement can be when the agencies work together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own state of South Australia, we saw 13.6 kilograms of heroin being seized and nine arrests being made across two states. The operation was between two states. It involved the following stakeholders: the South Australian Police, the National Crime Authority, the Australian Federal Police&mdash;I hope I have not left anybody out&mdash;and Customs. Customs 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> played an exemplary role in this particular matter. As I understand it, customs officers went just a bit further than a profile of customs checking required them to do. Putting in that extra effort and going that bit further is what enabled us to seize 13.6 kilograms of heroin. But I want to underline that it was a cooperative effort between a range of agencies and between states. That is the way forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Australasian Police Ministers Council met recently in Adelaide. It noted progress in a national heroin supply reduction strategy and endorsed a greater collaborative effort in the war against illicit drugs. Briefly, I would like to highlight a number of the initiatives announced by the Prime Minister in the `tough on drugs' campaign. There will be three additional AFP mobile strike teams. This means some 54 additional agents at a cost of some $15&half; million working on intelligence driven drug operations.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mobile strike teams will be supported by informant and witness protection programs with more money going into those programs&mdash;nearly $3 million in that respect. Of particular interest is the national heroin signature program and research into illicit drug use at a cost of over $1 million. That program will allow us to detect the pathways through which drugs have come. It is not true to say that it is a sort of DNA testing. But each packet of drugs has a particular characteristic that can allow us to pretty well source where it has come from. By continuing with that program over a number of years, we will have much better intelligence as to where to place customs officers, AFP officers, NCA officers and so on.</PARA>

I would point out to Senator Schacht at the outset that the drug strategy, which involved an expenditure of $87.5 million over three years, involved three prongs that dealt with health, law enforcement and education. In relation to education, I can

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, it is terribly important that we educate the next generation against illicit drug usage.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what are we doing in schools? We have adopted a zero tolerance policy. This is the policy of the states, and we are going to consult closely with the states to achieve this. Some of the aspects we are going to work towards are a national goal of no illicit drugs in schools and the development of a new high quality curriculum consistent with national goals for drug education in schools. We are also going to work towards professional development to assist teachers in delivering drug education in schools. It is, after all, the teachers who deliver this message in the schools, and they are going to need assistance of this sort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are going to conduct research into the usage of drugs by school&hyphen;age students in different situations and how best to target measures to ensure that our schools are drug free.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank Senator O'Chee for that question because I know he has taken a long&hyphen;term consuming interest in this matter. In fact I suppose it would be accurate to say that he was particularly focused. Madam President, I am pleased to advise the Senate that the government will introduce legislation to protect black and blue marlin from commercial fishing. In the 1996 election campaign we promised we would impose a mandatory ban on the taking of black and blue marlin by commercial operators if the existing voluntary ban proved to be ineffective. A small number of operators ignored the voluntary ban. Apart from inflaming the sports fishermen, the recreational fishermen, in the process it also gave a bad name to the majority of responsible commercial fishermen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, after discussions that I personally had with both the commercial fishermen and the sports fishermen, we agreed that we would introduce legislation next year to protect black and blue marlin from commercial fishing. Commercial fishing operators that catch black and blue marlin will be required to return them to the sea, dead or alive. This will be a disincentive for them to actually deliberately set out to catch black and blue marlin. The ban will apply to both the domestic industry and the Japanese long&hyphen;liners that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8577"> operate in our waters under the Australian bilateral fishing agreement. Operators who break the law will be subject to fines of up to $12,500.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also pleased to say that in the process of these discussions it was found that this problem between the sports fishermen and the commercial fishermen had been going on for the whole period of the previous Labor government, which did nothing whatsoever about it. As was usual with so many of these issues, they put their heads in the sand and pretended that it would go away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By organising the two groups to get together, I am pleased to say the game fishers, charter boat operators and commercial tuna operators who operate in the Coral Sea have negotiated an innovative agreement that will protect the billfish stocks in the area and enable the two industries to prosper and work together. The six&hyphen;point agreement recognises that commercial operators have a legitimate right to fish in the area, but sets a number of agreed restrictions, including the non&hyphen;retention of billfish except broadbill swordfish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Game fishing and commercial fishing are both very important industries in Far North Queensland. The Coral Sea is one of the world's major game fishing areas. It is one of the few places in the world where game fishers can chase the elusive 1,000&hyphen;pound black marlin. The game fishing industry's tag and release program means that those magnificent fish are released back into the ocean.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But commercial fishing is also an important industry. The majority tuna fishing company in area E, the Great Barrier Reef Tuna, a very responsible commercial fisher, employs directly some 50&hyphen;plus people within the Cairns region. The government strongly supports the multiple use of our marine resources. The agreement confirms my very strong view that we do not have to choose between game fishing and commercial fishing.

<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not think anybody could have missed the extraordinary spectacle of the last three weeks where the Prime Minister has completely lost his authority in the eyes of the Australian people. Mr Howard has dithered and bumbled his way through selling what in fact are half&hyphen;baked nursing home policies and, of course, his efforts have left Australia's elderly both bitterly disappointed and very angry. What Australians have seen in the past couple of weeks has been poor policy driven by weak leadership, of course panicked by opinion polling. This continues the inept decision making processes&mdash;the pattern that has developed during the life of the Howard government of ill&hyphen;thought&hyphen;out policy, changes and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8579"> backdowns forced upon the government by public opinion, then of course replaced by further ill&hyphen;thought&hyphen;out policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, at the same time Mr Howard has seen fit to shoot the messengers; in the first case, Ms Moylan. She was dumped because she was completely unable to sell the nursing home policy of the Howard government that Mr Howard himself, of course, later completely rejected. Mr Smith was handed the poisoned chalice. Of course he is a factional enemy of Mr Howard. They are just two of the corpses which have littered the first 18 months of the Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this particular policy issue has all the hallmarks of how Mr Howard does business. You have got, of course, a situation where, first of all, he is frightened by opinion polling. He gets in the results of the quantitative and qualitative polling and they scare the daylights out of him. There is no formal cabinet process, of course, when he gets those opinion poll results in front of him&mdash;no attempt to convene the cabinet, no attempt to convene cabinet committees, no consultation with his colleagues, no attempt to see the cabinet's five&hyphen;day and 10&hyphen;day rule applied at all. Those sorts of cabinet processes have been jettisoned again and again by Mr Howard, and this is a classic example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those sorts of processes are important policy safety valves. They provide a capacity for a Prime Minister to consult with his colleagues and for due process to be followed by any Prime Minister in any government. There was no attempt either to involve properly the Public Service in this country on these sorts of issues. There were no submissions from the relevant departments. There were no papers from the relevant departments for Mr Howard and his colleagues to consult. All that happened is that Mr Howard consulted five of his most panicked backbenchers&mdash;those who are in marginal electorates where there are elderly populations. Michael Gordon in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> described the result as self&hyphen;inflicted mayhem where those five did not hold back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard again failed to use the bureaucracy to craft policy as he should have. Then when he came to a decision, through that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> extraordinary process, what did he do? Did he have a full press conference? Did he put out a press release? No, he did an exclusive interview with Ray Martin.

He asked whether it was policy on the run. He said, `Doesn't this smack of panic, Prime Minister?' What did Mr Howard say? He said, `No.' That is all he could say. We know that the Prime Minister's backflip was off the high board, with a triple somersault, twist and pike, degree of difficulty of 3.6, but the elderly have not copped it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

Professor Gregory told your government that so much needed to be done, that there were hundreds of millions of dollars to be spent, yet you turned your faces away from the old people of Australia and, just as unfeelingly, you have now turned your back on them by frightening the life out of them. If you cared about older Australians at all you would have done something about them when you had the opportunity in government and you would not be trying to get yourselves back into government by frightening old people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course action needs to be taken; action now needs to be urgently taken because you did not do what had to be done at the time. Ms Macklin, the shadow minister, of all people, had the opportunity as a consultant to several ministers in this field to influence what should have been done during your years in government. She was being bought by the previous government to give advice for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8580"> policy development. Where were her principles at that time? Where was her concern for older Australians? You should all be ashamed of yourselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a need for reform. Everybody understands the need for reform. It is no good turning around and looking as though I am not talking about you because the members on the other side are all corporately responsible for the mess that we have inherited and for the poor quality of nursing homes in Australia after 13 years of Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you really object to the principle that those who have the means should contribute to their care to the extent that they are able? The Association of Independent Retirees, after all, are the most likely people to be affected by this. They are the people who have saved and do have some assets, yet they came out in the press&mdash;during their national conference in Queensland a couple of weeks ago&mdash;saying that this is an overdue measure, it does need to be done, it is a difficult measure, but it is right and proper that a government takes this action. They gave us credit for the courage, for the drive and for the good policy development that you did not take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You were a policy free zone in this area. You are even more hypocritical than appears on the face of it because you were prepared to do it for hostels. For goodness sake, what difference is there from hostels? I will tell you what the difference is: these days the people going into hostels are at about the level of frailty of people who used to go into nursing homes.</PARA>

I have never asked for anything to be withdrawn in this place, and she knows it. It was good to hear Senator Newman come out of the closet and be the last remaining supporter of up-front fees. Well done in defying the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), Senator Newman. After all, this is the same Prime Minister that took responsibility off you in this chamber for health and family

But it is good to know you still support up-front fees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have had in politics in the last few weeks is the Prime Minister going around this country saying, `Look, we're not going to alter on this. I'm going to show you I'm a real leader. I am tough. I am principled. Sorry, no change to this whatsoever.' What happened when the going got tough? He threw one of the Liberal ministers off the sled to the wolves. That was Mrs Moylan. She was thrown off. She was sacrificed and all blamed was attached to her, and that was going to be the end of the story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then a few weeks later the Prime Minister goes overseas. What happens next? His colleagues here modify the scheme. The Prime Minister, looking like he was at a grouse hunt at St Andrews, assured everyone that there would be no further changes. But as soon as he gets back to Australia, the real panic starts&mdash;the panic Wednesday. Wouldn't you love to be the Prime Minister's dry cleaner on that particular day!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you have is a total breakdown in government process. It is bad enough that this government adopted a five&hyphen;day cabinet rule instead of a 10&hyphen;day rule. But we all know that virtually no items in this current coalition government meet the five&hyphen;day rule. They are brought up under the line `in cabinet' because they are so paranoid that some details of the submission might leak. Therefore, you do not get detailed submissions with options any more; you get broad principles and `we will fill in the details later'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is exactly what happened last Wednesday. There was no cabinet meeting on this particular subject. There were no departmental submissions, no departmental coord comments on those submissions. So there was no detail worked out. The only detail was the political imperative, having read the polls: how do we get out from under?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister took charge. What did he do? He did two things. He rang five marginal seat holders dotted around the country to ask them for their views on this particular subject. He rang two or three members of the Expenditure Review Committee. He did not ring Senator Hill or Senator Alston and ask them for their views. He certainly did not ring Senator Herron.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So far in this debate we have heard from two former failed Labor ministers. One thing that they did not tell us about was what their cabinet consideration and ministerial consideration was when Mr Willis introduced funding changes for the hostel system on 8 November 1990. This is what Mr Willis had to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New funding arrangements were introduced in January 1989 which enable hostels to charge residents entry contributions and ongoing fees according to their ability to pay.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Where did you stand on that, Senator Faulkner? Did you stand up and fight in the ministerial room on that one? What is the bet Senator Ray did not either. Yet they have the indecency to come into this chamber and pretend that they are against such a system. Indeed, Mr Willis went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under these new arrangements hostels can receive higher fees from non&hyphen;financially disadvantaged residents who are better placed to contribute to costs of their care.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The abolition of the subsidy to those not financially disadvantaged will enable Commonwealth funds to be targeted to financially disadvantaged persons needing hostel care and on those needing a higher level of personal care.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what ultimately motivated this government's policy in that area. In pursuing that line, we have noted that there has been some community reaction to the basis of the way we intend to implement that general proposal. As a result, we as a government have reacted and acknowledged that we have made a mistake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But have you ever heard Senator Faulkner or Senator Ray in their contributions in this place acknowledging that, under their previous government, it was a mistake to make the huge prime ministerial promise that `no child shall live in poverty by the year 1990'? Where is their apology? Where is their acknowledgment that that was wrong? Remembering that they were both senior ministers in the previous government, where is their apology for telling us that the budget was in surplus when going to the last election in 1996? We know that was absolutely and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> utterly wrong&mdash;and they knew it. A $10.3 billion deficit was what awaited us. But did they have the decency to apologise for that? No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I say to the Australian people&mdash;through you, Madam Deputy President&mdash;that, when we make mistakes, we as a government are willing to acknowledge having done so and say so to the people of Australia, unlike the former government. Listen to some of these words of wisdom. Do you remember Gary Gray? He was your federal secretary, wasn't he? He said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we had on more occasions as a government said that we were sorry and acknowledged where we had got things wrong, then the results in the March election of last year would have been very different.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You failed to acknowledge your mistakes. What about former Senator Loosley? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mistakes were made and the wrong course was sometimes adopted, and such a concession needs to be stated clearly and bluntly by Kim Beazley and his team. The Labor Party should simply acknowledge that in 13 years in office there were errors of judgment and policy failures.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is quite clear to Gary Gray and to former Senator Stephen Loosley that mistakes will be made. When they are made, you ought to acknowledge them and get on with the job. That is what we have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what do we hear from the other side? Quite frankly, I could not determine why senators Faulkner and Ray were so upset at us for changing our policy. I thought in the previous three weeks the whole thrust of their argument was that we needed to change the policy. Now that we have changed the policy, they are the ones doing the reverse backflip with a 3.6 rate of difficulty. They are upset that we have made a change to policy because they thought it might have been a leg&hyphen;up for them at the next election. Now that that has been taken away from them, they are disappointed&mdash;not for the elderly people whom they claimed they were representing, but they are concerned for their own poll driven concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have changed our policy. We have changed. We have made the response to the community that they were expecting from us. Instead of being congratulated by the other 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8583"> side, what do we hear? More crocodile tears&mdash;this time though without any concern for the elderly; only for themselves. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the same matter: I think Senator Abetz's contorted logic really does not deserve a response other than to say that, if he is so keen on apologies, I look forward to the government's apology to the dispossessed Aboriginal people which he so rails against on other occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The answer from Senator Hill today was totally inadequate in terms of any attempt to explain what process was followed in this most lamentable of episodes. The process is important, because it is important to good government. But it is also important that the detail of this final or third decision is made known to the very many Australians who are still concerned and bewildered about the government's position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well to say, `We made a mistake.' That is laudable in one sense. But having said that you made a mistake, you have to then say what your policy is now, what you have done to fix up the mistake. What we saw from Senator Herron today in the eight or nine chances he had to have a go at it was that he could not explain that decision. He could not tell us. He said, `We made a mistake.' I am not sure whether that was the first time, the second time or, this occasion, the third go they have had at it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what he was not able to say is what the mistake was. He was not able to say, `Well, we've now fixed it, and this is the detail.' There is no detail available, so we have a lamentable process and we still have a policy position where the government cannot explain to elderly Australians what their policy in relation to nursing home fees and charges is. I think that is a disgrace. It is leaving a lot of elderly Australians, as well as a lot of people who care for them, very upset and concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen pretty shoddy government in the past on a range of issues. But perhaps among the worst claims able to be made about government decision making has been that it is government by press release. People say, `All we have is a press release that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> announces government decision.' On this occasion we did not even get the press release. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, went on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> to explain the decision, but he did not have enough grasp of the detail, he did not have enough information available, to put out a press release. They usually are only one&hyphen;page long. There usually is not a lot of detail once you get past the rhetoric in them. But he did not have enough detail to put out a press release explaining the position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we got from the Minister representing the Minister for Family Service in the Senate today would not fill up a one-page press release in terms of the detail available. We still do not know what the policy position of the government is. There is no information available to us to understand or deal with the implications of this policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well to make a mistake. They did. They made a mistake with the mark 1 proposal, they made a mistake with the mark 2 proposal, and I know that they made a mistake with mark 3 as well. But they do not know what that mistake is yet because they do not know what the policy is. When we find out what that is, we will find out also that they made a further mistake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is interesting though is the process that was followed here. It was explained in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> in a fascinating article. Apparently, rather than have a cabinet meeting to deal with the community concern, to address the policy issues, the Prime Minister phoned five backbenchers. He did not have a cabinet meeting, nor did he call for submissions from public servants. He did not look for detailed intricate work about the financial implications. He rang five backbenchers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Campbell, do you know whom he rang in Western Australia? He rang Richard Evans, the member for Cowan. I am sure that you are as aggrieved as the cabinet members were that they were overlooked in favour of Richard Evans. As we well know, this member is known for two things; he is known for plagiarism and wanting to kill cats. This is the man he rang. Forget the cabinet process; forget the advice of public servants. He rang 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8584"> the member for Cowan, Richard Evans, who, as I say, is famous for two things: plagiarism, and wanting to kill people's cats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At least when the Prime Minister rang Mr Evans he knew that he would not be arguing his own opinion; he would not be putting forward his own case. That is one thing you could be sure of. Whatever he said to the Prime Minister would not have been his own original proposition. At least, therefore, the Prime Minister was testing a wider market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But really, some elderly people have only two things left in their lives: their pet&mdash;often a cat&mdash;and their home. And the Prime Minister rings the bloke who wants to kill their cat to ask him about whether he should protect their home. Leave us alone! This is the advice sought; this is the process&mdash;and this is government&mdash;under John Howard's prime ministership. He rang the bloke who wants to kill your parents' cat to get advice about your parents' home.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we have just heard from Senator Evans exemplifies what the Labor Party is about on this issue, and that is simply a campaign of scare, scare, scare. There is no substance in the campaign, no alternative to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> offer. As the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) said in answering several questions on this issue today in question time, it is simply a case of all scare and no responsibility. This has been run by the opposition for weeks and weeks, and it has simply been repeated today in question time and in this subsequent taking note of answers debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

Remember the campaign of fear and loathing we were promised by the labour movement on industrial relations and on so many other issues? This is all they can do. They cannot offer anything positive, any alternative; all they do is create a scare campaign on falsely based premises about government initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in that context, therefore, that we ought to look at Labor's record on this issue&mdash;what they did when they were in government. After 13 years of neglect under Labor governments&mdash;the Hawke and the Keating Labor governments&mdash;this government came to office determined to address the poor state of nursing homes that had arisen as a direct result of that 13 years of neglect. And what was the result&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FAULKNER " NAMEID="5K4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator Faulkner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And look what you did. Are you embarrassed? You look embarrassed.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition leader in the Senate interjects with his usual nonsense. What was the result of those 13 years of neglect? The result was: substandard conditions in many nursing homes throughout this country; 40 per cent of residents having to share wards of four people or more; 13 per cent of facilities not meeting fire standards; 75 per cent of nursing homes not meeting all design and building codes; and 15 per cent of nursing homes not meeting health standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, that was because, under the Labor government, capital expenditure funding was cut substantially. In 1992&hyphen;93, $45 million was available for capital purposes for nursing homes. By 1995&hyphen;96, Labor's last year in office, this had dropped to $10.7 million&mdash;a 75 per cent reduction in funding under that neglectful previous Labor government. That government completely abrogated its responsi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8585"> bility to upgrade nursing homes. It is as a consequence of that that this government has to deliver reforms to provide the standard of nursing home accommodation that older Australians are entitled to&mdash;to provide improved comfort, improved safety and dignity to older Australians in their later years. So that neglect needs to be put squarely on the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague Senator Abetz referred a few moments ago to the comments of Mr Willis when he introduced the changes to hostel accommodation by the previous Labor government, the principle of which is being applied by this government to nursing homes. So the principle is exactly the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us hear what another Labor icon has said about this issue. Let us hear what a former senator, the much venerated former Minister for Finance, former Senator Walsh, said about this issue in an article in a March issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. He suggested that the government should recover from deceased estates the full cost of nursing home care. He said that, `as well as gaining revenue, this will appreciably reduce demand for beds and therefore costs.' That is what Labor icon, former Senator Walsh, said on this issue. There are the views of Labor operatives on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast to that, the present government is addressing the issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister's poor handling of the appointment of the Chairperson of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, in particular, the failure to consult as required under the terms of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The issue we are debating today is quite specific: it is not about whether Pat Dodson or Evelyn Scott, or any other person, should be appointed as Chairperson of the Council of Aboriginal Reconciliation; it is about whether or not our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has any respect for the law. I believe that the events surrounding the CAR controversy shows that he does not, and for that he should be condemned by the Senate today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those senators who are still yet to decide how, or whether, to vote on my motion, it is important that I restate the facts which back up my charge. The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Act 1991 requires the minister to consult with ATSIC, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Democrats on appointments to the council. Last Monday, the Acting Leader of the Democrats (Senator Lees) received a letter from the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) which outlined the process of, and timetable 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8594"> for, consultation under the law&mdash;the CAR act 1991. I quote in part from this letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have attached a list of persons being considered for possible appointment for the third term of Council . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following my consultations as specified by the Act, the process of appointment requires that I write to the Prime Minister requesting his approval or  consideration by Cabinet of the recommended appointments before forwarding the names to the Governor-General, who is responsible for appointing the Chairman, and other members referred to . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would appreciate your considering the attached list of names and replying to me in writing by 12 November 1997, in order that I can complete the process in the available timeframe.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In passing, I should say that the attached list was marked confidential, and we have respected that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Friday, however, we found out from the Prime Minister's own mouth at a press conference here in Canberra that the deal was already done&mdash;prior to the Australian Democrats receiving the minister's letter and apparently without the minister being involved. On the possible reappointment of Pat Dodson to the position of chairman, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's too late. Nobody has the right to bargain indefinitely with the Government on anything. I bent over backwards to secure this man's reappointment, but his opportunity to accept reappointment was last Sunday night.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"> I'm sorry he knocked me back last Sunday night, but he did.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So now we know. According to the Prime Minister he had no need to consult under the CAR Act 1991. It was his to offer, and his to offer on Sunday night a week ago&mdash;before the formal consultation process, as required by law, had even commenced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, this is a very clear-cut case of contempt for the law by the Prime Minister, and he should be condemned accordingly. I do not blame the minister at all. I have no evidence, yet, that he knew what his leader 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was doing. I know only of his letter which proposed a quite reasonable process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But whilst the minister was prepared to follow the law, the Prime Minister was not. The law says `consult first' and `decide second'; the Prime Minister acted to `decide first' and `consult last'. I suspect we have already heard the government's defence on this motion in the minister's answer to a question from Senator Bolkus today, when he said in effect, `Well, when you were in government you did it this way too!' That is just not good enough. The law should be observed, no matter who is in government. I refer government senators to an earlier answer given by the minister to Senator Ferris, where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to consider that the Council was established with unanimous cross party support.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It was. It is a tragedy that the Prime Minister has not listened to his own minister on this issue. If he had, perhaps he would not have flouted both the letter of the law and the spirit of the CAR model, by taking the law unto himself on that Sunday night. This is not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are pursuing this issue because we believe that reconciliation is at a crossroads in this country. I wonder whether this government has any vision at all for reconciliation. I believe that the government has divided the Aboriginal people, it has divided city and country, and it has divided the nation. I, like the Governor-General, am fearful for our nation and for its spirit. I weep for our nation if reconciliation falls apart completely. I only hope that we do not end up weeping tears of blood.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">It saddens me that Senator Woodley seeks to politicise this very important issue. I ask that he listen carefully to what I have to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reconciliation is far too precious to be damaged in this way. I repeat what I said on Friday in a statement released to the media: as a nation, we simply cannot afford to have reconciliation damaged in the political arena. I ask those who have been politicising this issue to stop and to think seriously about the implications of their actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As all senators would know, the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Act requires the minister to consult the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Democrats and ATSIC before advising the Governor&hyphen;General regarding appointments to the council. The terms of the current council members expire next month, and it is therefore appropriate that this consultation process be concluded soon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commenced the process on 25 September 1997, when I wrote to the chairman of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission inviting suggestions from the commission for possible appointments to the third council. The ATSIC chairman replied to my letter on 9 October 1997 with a list of possible nominees for my consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During September I also asked the Office of Indigenous Affairs to inquire informally of the current council members who would be willing to continue or interested in continuing to serve during the third term. Although not strictly necessary, the purpose of this exercise was to determine the minimum number of new members who would be required.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was always my view that in order to maintain some continuity in the council we should seek to reappoint some members, but that it would be desirable to also identify some new members who would bring freshness and new energy to the process. This appears to have also been the view of the previous government which appointed nine new people out of the 20 possible appointments for the second term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that Senator Woodley is not here to listen to this, but I trust that one of his advisers will listen and will convey the information to him. I table the letter received from my predecessor in relation to this. You will see from that letter that I followed the same sequence as did Mr Robert Tickner, my predecessor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That letter was sent on 4 October 1994, and I understand that it was received on 5 October 1994. The letter proposed both the chair and the deputy chair, just as my letter did. The proposed deputy chair was also a proposed new appointment. The letter asked for a reply from the nominees by 10 October, nine days after it was received. As I indicated, there was no real consultation, because the minister at the time nominated the number of names required to fill the council. So there was no consultation. In contrast, I issued a list&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am tabling the letter. It is underwritten by Mr Tickner. In contrast, I issued a list of 50 or so names, seeking comment and suggestions from the opposition. The process I have undertaken is much more open, fair and consultative than that undertaken by the previous government, and it is in complete accord with the act. To suggest otherwise is hypocrisy of the worst kind and brands those opposite as people who are trying to score cheap political points off the reconciliation process. I think it is too important to be a political football.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To come back to the appointments, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and I met with Mr Dodson and Mr Viner on 27 August to discuss the outcomes of the Australian reconciliation convention and the council's work in its final term. After that meeting, I invited Mr 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8596"> Dodson to provide me with suggestions for membership of the new council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 23 September 1997, I also wrote to Mr Dodson as chairman of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, seeking his input regarding the composition of the third council, and again inviting him to provide me with a list of people he considered suitable and worthy of consideration by the government for appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although I met with Mr Dodson on 15 October and again on 27 October&mdash;and despite his undertaking to me to do so&mdash;I still have not received a list of proposed appointees from Mr Dodson. At our meeting on 27 October, he gave no indication that he did not intend to continue as chairman of the council. Three days later, however, on Thursday, 30 October, I received letters by fax from both Mr Dodson and Mr Viner advising that they did not wish to be considered for reappointment to the third council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I replied to Mr Dodson and Mr Viner on the evening of Thursday, 30 October acknowledging their letter and thanking them both for their dedicated efforts. I do not think anybody would not agree that they have been dedicated and that their efforts have been to great effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At subsequent meetings with me and with the Prime Minister on 2 November, Mr Dodson confirmed his decision and indicated that he would not reconsider. In other words, Mr Dodson was given two opportunities&mdash;one in a meeting with me on the Friday after I received his letter, and another with the Prime Minister on the Sunday&mdash;to reconsider his decision, and he decided against doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the light of that, and because of the tight time frame in which we were working, I made contact with Ms Evelyn Scott and Sir Gustav Nossal to inquire whether, if asked, they would be willing for the government to nominate them for the positions of chair and deputy respectively. As I have mentioned, that was the same sequence as with the letter that went from Mr Robert Tickner to the Leader of the Opposition at the time when both the chairman of the reconciliation council and the deputy chairman were named in that list. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> total number was the number of people to be nominated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 3 November, following the Prime Minister's meeting the previous evening with Mr Dodson, I wrote to the leaders of the opposition and of the Australian Democrats about the proposed appointments and, as I mentioned, I enclosed a list of over 50 names for consideration, including the government's nominated chair and deputy. I invited any comments they may have regarding the list of proposed members and any further names they would like to have considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Friday 7 November, over a week after Mr Dodson's letter saying no to reappointment, the Prime Minister received another letter by fax, dated 6 November, from Mr Dodson, indicating that he had reconsidered and would be prepared to accept reappointment on a number of terms and preconditions. Bear in mind that this was after Ms Scott and Sir Gustav Nossal had been contacted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Prime Minister explained during his press conference last Friday evening, it was too late to bargain over those positions as the government had already spoken to Ms Scott and Sir Gustav Nossal and they are the nominated chair and deputy.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was quite depressed last Friday night. I was watching television and, as I watched the news, I saw the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) talking about having a double dissolution based on the Wik legislation. I have to say to anyone who is really concerned about this society that that is not the way we have to go. It was depressing because we really should be putting ourselves above the playing of politics with a race card, which we seem to be well on the road to doing in this country. We&mdash;all of us, wherever we come from&mdash;have responsibilities to act for the Australian people and to try to build cohesiveness in this society. The Prime Minister's response to the bad week of Aboriginal politics&mdash;a week when we saw the Wik legislation once again unravelling, a week when we saw the incompetent handling of the reconciliation council issue&mdash;was to unnecessarily lead us down a road which would be quite destructive to this society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Playing the race issue is explosive. We do not have to do it. I have always thought that in trouble this Prime Minister would be too tempted not to resort to it, but I always hoped that he would not and I always hoped that this government would pull back from it. I think it is going to be very depressing for our nation if we do embark upon a race campaign, particularly as we lead up to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8598"> centenary of Federation, the Sydney Olympics and the new millennium, and particularly given the diversity of our society with one in four people coming from a non&hyphen;English speaking background.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the events of the last few weeks with the reconciliation council&mdash;and these are the events that Senator Herron did not discuss&mdash;you see what has led to the falling apart, the disintegration, of the process and the people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pat Dodson wrote on 30 October, `It has been extremely worrying to have watched the present government actively pulling apart the delicate threads of reconciliation that many Australians have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been weaving into a beautiful garment. The attempt to diminish the status and rights of Aboriginal people in this country will not see history record great praise of this period.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ian Viner went on with a very succinct exposition of the problems at hand. He wrote to Minister Herron saying, `I feel, and I know that Mr Dodson feels, that the government will lose a wonderful opportunity for good in Australia if it continues on its present path. There must be a change of heart, a change of understanding and a change of direction by the government on Hansonism, the stolen generations, native title, indigenous disadvantage and the acceptance of the cultural identity of ATSI peoples within our democratic and constitutional structures if the government is to give leadership to all Australians.' We are not just talking here of a process which did not just follow the procedures laid down by the law. We are talking here of a deeper and greater concern that these responsible people had&mdash;concern at the way this government was handling a very important and sensitive area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is concern, I think, that reflects the fact that indigenous Australians have been treated as second&hyphen;class citizens by this government. When you look at the whole debate on Wik, for instance, sure, they had meetings with them, they visited with them and sat in the same room with them, but they were not listening, they were not tuned in. As a result, not one substantive concern of indigenous people in respect of the Wik legislation was picked up by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are still not listening. Last week we had the Prime Minister on TV saying, `Wik is not a racial issue; it is a land management and investment&hyphen;security&hyphen;welfare of Australia issue.' If it is not a race issue, why are you legislating under the race power of the constitution? Could you give us an answer to that? It is very much an issue of race. It is an issue through which legislation introduced by this parliament discriminates against one racial group, takes away their property, does not provide just terms, does it retrospectively and does it in breach of international covenants that we are responsible for through breaches of non&hyphen;discriminatory obligations. Of course 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8599"> it is a race issue, but either the Prime Minister does not understand or does not want to understand. As I say, they went through the motions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The defenders of black people are vilified, whether they be opposition or independent senators, community organisations, the Australian Law Reform Commission and other arms of government, or religious leaders in this country. But the opponents of indigenous Australians are protected, even if the voices of the opponents are the voices of people such as Pauline Hanson, the voice of prejudice and hatred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To this government, Pauline Hanson's voice is protected whilst religious leaders of this country are attacked. The voices of decency really carry no weight in this debate, and that, I think, should be of concern to all of us in this place and to the broader community. No wonder the rest of the world is starting to look at Australia, and that it is starting to look at us with concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us be clear about what is happening here. The wider context is the one I mentioned of Aboriginal Australians not being treated as equal citizens. Secondly, let us look at the damage we are doing here. Pat Dodson is an important, eminent, well&hyphen;respected Australian. He is also representative of a whole range of people like him, whether it be the Dodsons, the O'Donoghues, Pat Turner, Tracker Tilmouth, Peter Yu, Mick Dodson and, of course, Noel Pearson&mdash;and I could go down the list. These people are part of a leadership of indigenous Australians which has been keen to work with government for a co&hyphen;existence outcome and for a consensual outcome. These are leaders who have been under immense pressure&mdash;and the pressure goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people have been delivering to this nation for a long time, but what do they get for it? They get vilified and abused. And when Noel Pearson bells the cat he gets even more abuse. We are losing an opportunity to build this society into a cohesive society when we ditch the talents of the Dodsons, all the others that I mentioned, and the emerging group of young indigenous leaders. We 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cannot deliver a consensual outcome without them. Your government is burning them. You are not listening to them; you only respond to them with closed ears. You tune into another network, and you vilify them when they get too loud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other concern is that this government does not like people criticising it. I think it was an amazing performance last week when we had church leader after church leader on record expressing their concern about how indigenous affairs are treated in this country. And what is the Prime Minister's response? The Prime Minister says, `At the end of the day nobody owns the moral conscience of this nation.' He says, `Let us just denigrate them on the way through. Let us tell religious leaders they have really no monopoly over the moral conscience of this nation.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a dereliction and a failure of leadership. Why does he do it? He does it because, at the start of the week, we had religious leader after religious leader&mdash;for instance, Reverend Tim Costello&mdash;expressing concern at the divisive, destructive racial conflicts that we are seeing in the current debate. We had the Catholic church, the Archbishop of Perth, the Australian Catholic Bishops Congress all speaking, as if with one voice, and saying, `Hold on and pause; this is very destructive stuff.' But what is the Prime Minister's response&mdash;`Don't listen to them because they have no rights over the moral conscience of the nation.' A bit of respect for the archbishops, the bishops, the preachers and so on by the Prime Minister would also be useful in terms of the society we are trying to build together here.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a critical period for us. The lead has been shown by the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, over the last couple of weeks: talking to Pat Dodson, trying to get a constructive outcome, acting in many ways for the betterment of the nation but also, on the way through, for the government. That lead should have been taken up. But, unfortunately, we have two people responsible in this area who really cannot fill the requirements of the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Herron really, I think, should just pause for a moment and perhaps reconsider what he has done here. He acted with undue haste and overrode the processes of legislation. Why did he do it? He said to us today that he wrote to Mr Beazley on 3 November. That was after he put out a press statement on 31 October, three days earlier, saying that he, as minister, had written a letter to the leaders of the opposition and of the Australian Democrats as part of the consultation process on the make&hyphen;up of a new Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. He put out the press statement. He said he signed the letter. But the letter was not sent from his office for three critical days.</PARA>

You had an obligation for decent, in&hyphen;depth consultation and what did you do? You sat on the letter for three days, and you acknowledged it in here this afternoon. We need better leadership.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remember when the legislation to create the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation was presented for the consideration of the Senate in August 1991. Unlike the pious rhetoric today, there was then a genuine consideration of that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8601"> legislation and a proper focus on achieving true reconciliation. I spoke to that bill, as did the newest member of the Labor Party now, then Senator Cheryl Kernot, in her former capacity as the Democrat spokesman on Aboriginal affairs. Not surprisingly, that legislation received very strong support from this chamber with Senator Kernot herself declaring:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am very pleased to be able to add the support of the Australian Democrats for this Bill to that of the Opposition and the Government in a multipartisan way.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Woodley's motion today is only the second motion by Senator Woodley in his time in this place on this issue. Senator Bolkus has just referred to the process that  has been put forward by the minister today for the consideration of members. Compare that with Mr Tickner in 1994 when he presented as a fait accompli a list of names. The failure to consult was that of Tickner; he just delivered a list of names. The politics that is being played certainly goes to that extent. I would commend the work of the two past councils in what they have done. I would certainly hope that the next council will again respond as positively as the last two have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal and National parties supported the establishment of the reconciliation council on the basis that there must be wider consultation with the wider Australian community and not just sectional interests. This was always a particular concern of mine, coming from the Northern Territory, because we had witnessed a federal Labor government pander to interests of a select few to the detriment of the interests of the wider community. I had concerns that the Labor Party would again fail to consult the Australian community and threaten the success of reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to remember that in 1991 there was another piece of legislation also before the parliament. That was the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991 which enjoyed the support of the Democrats but not the then coalition opposition. I did not support that bill because it proposed to totally ban political advertising on both radio and television, thus effectively excluding most of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the regional community of my electorate of the Northern Territory from an essential part of the political process. Most of the people who would have been politically disenfranchised were the Aboriginal people living in rural and remote areas of the Northern Territory&mdash;parts of Australia that rely almost totally on radio and television, with the print media initially non&hyphen;existent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition parties supported the establishment of Aboriginal reconciliation on the understanding that there would be agreed goals and benchmarks for progress in education, health, housing and infrastructure; in general, an overall improvement in Aboriginal wellbeing. If you go to the 1993&hyphen;94 report of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and look at the issues that were then flagged as achievements and performance indicators, it is very important to look at how they matched up with the record of the then government of the day. Labor's legacy in this whole area of Aboriginal affairs was disgraceful and dreadful, despite their spending over $16 billion on their specific indigenous programs, without any commitments to outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at their record it is interesting to note that infectious diseases did not improve. Infant mortality was higher. Life expectancy was appalling. There were incomplete schooling processes. Water, sewerage, electricity and sealed roads did not improve. The unemployment rate for indigenous people was ghastly and their income share of the community did not improve. Labor made a mess of the Native Title Act, and that is what we in this parliament are currently proceeding to fix up. Despite all of the rhetoric and the expenditure that they put into reducing deaths in custody, the number of deaths actually continued to rise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you compare that with the most recent report of the Council For Aboriginal Reconciliation, the annual report of 1996&hyphen;97, and then you go to the performance indicators of that report, it is fascinating to see that they are now being met and are able to be measured by way of outcomes. We will spend almost $400 million more in real terms on indigenous specific programs in our first four 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8602"> years in office than were spent in the last four years of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accountability of Aboriginal organisations is being addressed and properly looked at despite the fact that for 13 years Labor did nothing. Business incentive programs are now being concentrated on to encourage indigenous business enterprises. The army is cooperating with infrastructure projects, such as roads, airstrips and housing, in remote communities. Primary health care programs are seeing injections of important and additional funding. If you look at the special area of deaths in custody you find that the criminal justice system is being addressed. Specifically, the recommendations are being picked up. This government is responding to those recommendations. Those are the issues that  are commented on in the annual report of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are reviews under way in the area of CDEP which will impact on employment for Aboriginal people. A review is being undertaken of Abstudy, which is vitally important to the training and educational opportunities of young people, many of whom are desperate to participate in the wider community. They are responding to the very issues, the performance indicators, that the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation for the last few years has put down. It is so easy to see when the government responds to issues such as reforming the Heritage Protection Act that you will not get a similar debacle as happened with Hindmarsh Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is putting a commitment very solidly into economic independence for indigenous Australians. We are proud of that record and so we should be. It is interesting to go back to the reports of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and judge them against the spending and policy priorities of the government in the respective years. There have been six reports since 1991. Read the report for each of the years of Labor administration and there is no marrying up in those important areas. Read the one for the last year and every one of the programs is currently being addressed across each and every portfolio of this government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Too often in the area of Aboriginal affairs we engage in public relations sessions and talkfests. The Labor Party did that for years rather than looking for desperate and necessary practical solutions. We must address the areas of drug and alcohol dependence. We must address the areas of children's health measures, nutrition and parent support. We must address basic literacy. We must address the issue of employment opportunities for youth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal&hyphen;National Party government in 18 months in office has done more than 13 years of Labor in each and every one of these areas. For $16 billion we saw no measured outcomes. Instead it was just the Labor Party continuing with its political control and manipulation of Aboriginal  communities for political reasons rather than trying to instil and importantly build up the independence, the dignity and the involvement in the wider community and giving special recognition to those things that are inherent to Aboriginal culture itself. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Aboriginal Australians essentially lost their voice in the Commonwealth government with the election of the Howard administration last year. The Howard government has not simply disenfranchised Aboriginal people, it has been deliberately antagonistic to their interests. That policy has been pursued from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) down. The public record clearly demonstrates this. This government has been engaged in a non&hyphen;stop policy of assault and battery in Aboriginal affairs since March last year. That assault began within a month of this government taking office, and I will recall the events to you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard called his first press conference as Prime Minister in Canberra to announce that he was putting a special auditor into ATSIC and freezing their funds. He also announced that the government would seek legislative change&mdash;which they did&mdash;to give them power to sack the entire ATSIC board and install an administrator. That was the Prime Minister's first press conference after the election, in Canberra.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8603">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appointment of the special auditor was later found by the Federal Court to be unlawful and this Senate blocked the attempt by the government to impose an administrator on ATSIC, if the government so desired. The point is that all of this was done by the Howard government without a single word of prior consultation with ATSIC or, indeed, any Aboriginal people in Australia. That government has charged, under its own legislation, ATSIC as the principal policy adviser in indigenous affairs to this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The battery came in last year's budget with more than $400 million ripped out of the forward estimates for ATSIC. In terms of the cant we have heard again here today, about nothing done in 13 years under a Labor administration, I would refer all honourable senators to the proceedings of the last estimates&mdash;that is, the last Senate estimates that canvassed the area of Aboriginal affairs&mdash;where ATSIC officers put that nonsense to rest, well and truly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts tore the heart out of ATSIC's discretionary programs&mdash;that is, their social and cultural programs&mdash;which to the shame of this government were described by this government as `political programs'. A no&hyphen;growth policy imposed on the community development employment program raised the prospect&mdash;again confirmed at Senate estimates&mdash;of Aboriginal unemployment going to in excess of 40 per cent by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation worsened considerably with the Prime Minister's appearance at the national reconciliation convention, and who could ever forget that. Who could ever forget the television images of the Prime Minister screaming abuse at the delegates from the podium and looking anything but relaxed and comfortable. It was only later, during estimates hearings again, that we found out that he had gone to that convention without seeking one word of advice from his key advisory body in Prime Minister and Cabinet&mdash;that is, the Office of Indigenous Affairs&mdash;or ATSIC as to how the government might respond to the stolen generations report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister had not bothered to seek anything other than a formal legal brief 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on its contents before going to the reconciliation convention, despite the fact that the report had been with the government for more than two months. This was a report which the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron, told the Senate he considered would be one of the most important he would ever receive as minister. Mind you, he then told Senate estimates that he carried it around for weeks before reading it because he only had a photocopy and was waiting for a printed copy of the document. You can understand my astonishment when I learned that ATSIC did not receive a copy of the report until the day it was released.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister clearly has no understanding about how important consultation is to Aboriginal people. In this context, I noticed a report in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> headed, `Talk to black people, says Ray.' The report says that the host of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS>, Ray Martin&mdash;who is a member of the National Reconciliation Council&mdash;has been told by John Howard that he is keen to tour Aboriginal settlements in the outback to hear their concerns first&hyphen;hand.

I know how many you have been to, Minister. I also know how many Aboriginal communities the Prime Minister has been to&mdash;none. The Prime Minister apparently told Ray Martin that he would visit communities very soon. This is in today's press. He is going to do it privately, Martin said. He continued:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I think it would be an extraordinary and enlightening process not just for the Prime Minister but for most Australians if they actually stopped and talked to black people . . . "</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not know when Ray Martin last talked to the Prime Minister, but I can inform the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8604"> Senate that there are a lot of Aboriginal people around Australia wondering when the Prime Minister is going to take time to visit them. He said last year he would do so. That is why I want to make this point. As far as I can gather, apart from a highly publicised visit to the Torres Strait, he has not done so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a press conference in Parliament House on 13 December last year, Mr Howard told journalists that the new board of ATSIC and the new chairman, Gatjil Djerrkura, had expressed the wish to work in a very positive way with the government. He was then asked by a journalist when he would visit Aboriginal communities himself. He replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have had some discussions already with some people regarding that, including the chairman of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, and when I am in a position to indicate when I will be doing that I will let you know, but I have spent some time over the past few months&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">this is last year&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">constructing the broad outline of my diary for next year and it will involve a great deal of travel around Australia. I do not want to visit Aboriginal communities in settlements in any kind of tokenistic sense but I do want to visit them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clearly, every journalist in the room was left with the impression that John Howard intended to visit those communities at least at some stage during this year. He has not done so. As far as I am aware, as I said, he has made one well publicised trip to the Torres Strait to discuss their autonomy and that is it. Given that we are a month and a half away from the end of the year, I can only assume he will not be visiting any Aboriginal communities before the end of 1997. Given the intensity of public debate currently over Wik, the stolen generation report and Aboriginal health and education, to name just a few of the issues surrounding indigenous affairs, one does wonder why the Prime Minister has not found time this year to fulfil his promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also say that I personally think that the quote of the debate so far was the statement just issued by Senator Nick Bolkus. The Prime Minister has gone on the front foot and said, `Oh, no debate in Australia over the native title bill would be a race debate. It is just a debate over land management.' What nonsense that is in real life. But, as Senator 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Bolkus pointed out, how can the government say that with a straight face when it has told this Senate again and again that it is relying for the very constitutional validity of that bill on the race power of the constitution? In fact, it has gone one step further than that. It has said that not only does it rely on the race power, it relies on legislation even being detrimental to the interests of Aboriginal people still being supported by the race power under the constitution. Indeed, the minister for Aboriginal affairs has told us that on a number of occasions here in this Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ray Martin was quite right when he was quoted in the paper today as saying that the reconciliation process is like dragging the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queen Mary</EMPHASIS> through treacle. Indeed, it is a difficult exercise and was always going to be. The reason Ray Martin said that was that it is such a difficult proposition, and it is, that some degree of continuity in terms of the leadership of that reconciliation process is absolutely essential. No-one could doubt the effectiveness that both Pat Dodson and Ian Viner as a team have brought to the leadership of that council. Having attended a number of extremely hostile meetings on Aboriginal issues at which Pat Dodson has been a speaker, he certainly has a lot more patience and forbearance than I have. I think he has done an outstanding job. You would have thought there would have been some interest in the government going that one step further and retaining his services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are these three conditions that the government is carrying on about?&mdash;`Oh, you can't negotiate with people forever; you have to make a decision.' What are these three impossible conditions that Pat Dodson has laid down for the final term of this council, and that is what it is? Not only should he retain his position on the council but that his deputy should as well and that the government give a commitment to some document of reconciliation. They are the three conditions. I would have thought that, if they cannot achieve three out of three, they are not particularly interested in reconciliation. There is a view about in the government that it was probably a good idea to get rid of this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8605"> troublesome ex&hyphen;priest on the way through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the minister has been gazumped on this. We all know that&mdash;it is public property. The minister, and I am not criticising him, has undergone proper process. I would point out that that proper process, and the minister offered no defence of it, still has two days to run. The advice that was sent out to the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats clearly stated that they still have 48 hours to respond. But what is the point of responding? The act requires this to be done only with the chairman and deputy chairman in terms of these particularly important appointments. The Prime Minister has gazumped the process entirely and announced that those appointments have already been determined 48 hours before the process laid down by Minister Herron has been exhausted.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of my objectives as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has been to remove unnecessary political point scoring from Aboriginal affairs to enable the nation to move forward over the coming decade . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is something that seems to have been forgotten by those colleagues of former minister Tickner who are now sitting opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the former minister, the coalition government is strongly committed to the reconciliation process. It is well known now, and well documented this afternoon, just how hard the government tried to persuade Mr Dodson to remain as chair of this council. But the first paragraph of his letter says it very clearly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After serious consideration, I find that I am unwilling to seek reappointment as the chairman of the council for reconciliation. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is hardly ambiguous&mdash;not a whim and not without thought. He says that he finds that he is unwilling, after serious consideration, to continue as chair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very clearly, Mr Dodson had thought about his position long and hard, and he wrote a 2&half; page letter expressing the view that he did not wish to be reappointed. It is also now well known and clearly documented that the government tried very hard to dissuade Mr Dodson from that view. But he declined, despite further invitations on several occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is instructive to have a look at the consultation process adopted by those opposite, despite receiving and requesting&mdash;as former minister Tickner said&mdash;support on the establishment of the council from this party, the now government. It is very clear that, when the Labor Party was in government, that consultative process did not exist. The previous government did not seem to consider that reconciliation and consultation was even an issue. It did not even consult the opposition when they made their appointments to the council. Labor's minister, Mr Tickner, only wrote to the leaders of the opposition after the final appointees had been proposed&mdash;very clearly, a different proposition to that put by Senator Bob Collins a few minutes ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government believes that the reconciliation process must grow from the community level. Also, we must not lose sight of this important principle: the community must be involved. Reconciliation is not a top down process. Equally, it does not resolve itself by resting on the shoulders of any one person. It is bigger than that. It affects all of us. To suggest that reconciliation has now in some way ended, failed, been buried, because an individual&mdash;albeit a very talented and hard working man&mdash;has chosen of his own free will and, as he said, after careful consideration, not to be reappointed is highly irresponsible and reckless. This man considered his position very carefully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I personally was very disappointed to see the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and his new bridesmaid, Mrs Kernot, in this morning's newspapers proclaiming the end of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8606"> reconciliation in our time, as we know it. Senator Woodley's former colleague says that the council is now only `a token body' and that there is no point in continuing with the council's reconciliation process. Senator Woodley, I hope that Mrs Kernot's defection from your group does not mean you now are an empty shell; I am sure that you are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those people who proclaim themselves to be for reconciliation, how much more damaging could Mrs Kernot's comments have been intended to be? They are a tragedy for Aboriginal people and the reconciliation process which is important to all of us. That process is too important to be abused or politically used by any individual. Patrick Dodson himself has made note of that. He did not see that his resignation would amount to the end of reconciliation&mdash;not a bit of it. In fact, his final words in his letter of 30 October to Senator Herron are worth repeating here. He said:</PARA>

I am not here to defend the ALP. But I note the minister has quoted the act, and that is what I am concerned about. The law says `consult, then decide'; the Prime Minister has said `decide, then consult'. The minister says that this is not so. The test for the minister's claim is simple: is it too late? After 12 November, we will know&mdash;as will the whole nation&mdash;whether it is too late for reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have read the minister's speech entitled `Reconciliation: is it possible?' It is a very good speech. I found it moving. I think what he should do now is make sure his Prime Minister reads that speech. I think perhaps that would perform a conversion in his heart that we are all looking for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the Senate will support my motion. The act has not been followed. I believe that we cannot have a Prime Minister flouting the law and thumbing his nose at what the law requires.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I thank the Senate for giving me this time to speak. I wish to speak, particularly with ministers present, on the matter of bankruptcy because of the events surrounding Alan Bond and his desire, in my view, to evade justice. The close of the 1980s witnessed a surge in the number of bankrupts in Australia and the years that followed demonstrated that the Bankruptcy Act and related legislation needed reforming. The whole community has watched with amazement the drawn&hyphen;out court cases and legal action in pursuit of failed tycoons such as Mr Alan Bond and Mr Christopher Skase and the inability of the bankruptcy legislation to effectively pursue white&hyphen;collar criminals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note in passing the diligent efforts of the government in trying to pursue this matter and I also note in passing the frustration it must inevitably experience as a result of the difficulties it has had in trying to collar Mr Bond's friends overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alan Bond's prolonged and contrived attempts to stave off the Australian Federal Police investigations into his financial dealings with Swiss banker Jurg Bollag has once again drawn attention to the ineffectiveness of our revised  bankruptcy laws and the ineffectiveness of their interaction with our international counterparts. The ability of the AFP to question people associated with a bankrupt clearly must be strengthened under the Bankruptcy Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During Alan Bond's bankruptcy hearings creditors felt that they were forced to settle for 0.05c in the dollar. Authorities must be allowed to verify whether millions of other people's dollars, which Alan Bond had in his care, have been secreted away in Swiss banks 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8608"> administered by Jurg Bollag. Constraints in calling witnesses to give evidence and the high onus of proof thresholds have frustrated the AFP efforts and have contributed to the loss of millions of dollars in public funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The burden on public funds could, we hope, be minimised if the legislation was further reformed. I cannot say to those of you who are ministers here just how you should reform it, but I do think I express the feelings of the Australian public when I say they really do want much more action in this area. The legal system has found it much easier to indict small business and small participants in our system for far lesser sins than have been committed by the Bonds and Skases. Big business and their big advisers seem still to be adept at manipulating the legal and bankruptcy systems. Reforms must be made to minimise the use of delay tactics and avoidance. Bankruptcy laws should be strengthened to ensure that wilful fraud is capable of being exposed, and the AFP must have the opportunity to properly investigate all avenues and all allegations of fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians have a right to expect that the corporate excesses of the 1980s not only will be punished but will never be repeated. The  Australian Democrats, and I personally, have long been concerned about the adequacies of Australia's laws and resources for policing corporate criminals. It seems odd to me that the government has laws in its possession which attempt to prevent farmers, for instance, as it did recently, from exercising the right to silence under the customs laws and yet it is able under bankruptcy laws to allow situations in which people contrive to conceal their true state of affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Australians are to have confidence to invest in Australian companies, the legislation must protect small shareholders and large shareholders and must unequivocally punish and pursue white&hyphen;collar crime. We have welcomed substantial reforms that have occurred in the Bankruptcy Act area, but the effectiveness of these laws will only be proven to the people as a whole when some very large fish are caught in the net. I urge the government to relook at this area. If the government does relook at this area, it will

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia owes a significant debt to the men and women who have served in defence of Australia. The purpose of this bill is to protect and preserve one of their long&hyphen;standing compensatory benefits, a subsidised housing loan under the Defence Service Homes Act 1918.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government has been very pleased with the reduction in interest rates. This is continuing good news for the economy in general. However, the reduction in the market rates for housing loans has significantly reduced the value of the beneficial interest rates that have traditionally been available to borrowers under the Defence Service Homes Loan Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill introduces a guaranteed minimum subsidy that will ensure Defence Service Homes borrowers retain an interest rate advantage of at least 1.5 per cent lower than the Benchmark rate, regardless of future changes in the market interest rates. These changes will take effect from 5 January 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Benchmark rate is the average unregulated standard annual rates of interest applied to the largest number of owner&hyphen;occupied housing loans provided by the five largest banking group providers of housing finance in Australia. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This guaranteed minimum subsidy provides a simple means for responding to and accommodating future fluctuations in interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also introduces a single rate of interest for those many borrowers whose loans may comprise two, or even three, different rates linked to different levels of borrowings. Each of these multi&hyphen;tiered loan rates will be collapsed to a single interest rate. The effective new interest rate will depend on the current mix of interest rates on a particular loan. This arrangement will benefit many borrowers, and means the abolition of the 10 per cent interest rate which has been an issue of some concern to the veteran community. Until now, they have been prevented from repaying their 10 per cent tier faster than the lower tiers. Its introduction is part of this Government's continuing commitment to providing and improving justly deserved compensation measures to veterans and war widows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Continuing this rationalisation of the Defence Service Homes interest rates, this bill will reduce the interest rate on additional advances and on advances made for essential repairs. In reducing the interest rate on these advances, the Government completes its reform of these rates which it began during the 1996&hyphen;97 Budget, when a lower interest rate was introduced for certain new additional advances. All advances will now have an interest rate of 6.85 per cent or less.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Defence Service Homes Scheme is administered jointly by the Commonwealth and the Westpac Banking Corporation. The administrative arrangements are set by agreement between the Commonwealth and Westpac. Following any legislative change some consequent amendments need to be made to the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to those implementing lower interest rates, these amendments will reflect changes in business and banking practice since the original agreement in 1988 and the need to simplify administrative procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, this bill once again demonstrates the determination of this Government to preserve and protect the benefits of veterans and their families. The bill not only benefits many people by direct interest reductions, but the guaranteed minimum subsidy provides an important, continuing protection of the benefits under the Defence Service Homes Scheme.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes amendments to the income tax law in relation to capital gains tax roll&hyphen;over relief 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8611"> for small business. These amendments were announced by the Prime Minister on 24 March 1997 as part of the Government's response to the report of the Small Business Deregulation Taskforce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specifically, the bill will extend the capital gains tax small business roll&hyphen;over relief to the disposal of certain shares in companies and units in unit trusts. The roll&hyphen;over relief measures currently allow capital gains on the disposal of active assets of a small business, where replacement active assets are acquired. These amendments will allow a capital gain on the sale of a business to be rolled over where this is done through the sale of shares or units. In addition, certain shares and units will be able to be nominated as replacement assets for the purposes of the provisions.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extension of the roll&hyphen;over relief to shares and units will apply to disposals of assets from 1 July 1997, which is also the date of effect for Division 17A. The technical amendments have various application dates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendment of the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments made to the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 by Schedule 2 of the bill will establish a new sales tax regime for suppliers of computers and related goods to combat sales tax fraud involving personal computers and related goods. The amendments have been developed following a successful period of consultation with the industry, sales tax practitioners and other interested parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) have received numerous representations from business about the adverse effects that  sales tax evasion is having in the industry. The impact is especially disadvantaging smaller legitimate operators who are often much less able to absorb the competitive disadvantage. A particularly worrying consequence of the fraud is that a large number of legitimate operators who claim their business survival is at risk are reluctantly being drawn into dealing with the fraudulent operators. In doing so they not only contribute to sustaining the fraud but also put themselves at serious risk of being a party to an offence. It is also apparent that a number of industry operators, while not directly involved in the commission of the fraud, are taking commercial advantage of the cheap source of supply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is estimated that such fraudulent activity is costing the Government approximately $80 million per annum. Whilst that threat to the revenue is of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concern to the Government, the major concern is that fraudulent operators should not continue to enjoy a competitive advantage from failure to comply with the sales tax laws. The amendments contained in this bill will remove this competitive advantage and place all operators in an even position. Operators who can only compete on a fraudulent basis may be driven out of the industry. This is a result which the Government would welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the entrenched nature of this fraudulent activity and that normal administrative action is not effective, it is considered that the most effective approach is to remove the opportunity for the fraud to be committed rather than rely on after the event enforcement action. The central feature of the new scheme is that access to tax&hyphen;free personal computers and related goods (defined as Part 7A goods) will be denied to taxpayers who have not established, to the Commissioner's satisfaction, that they are likely to fulfil their obligations under the tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People who have established, by satisfying certain criteria, that they are likely to fulfil their taxation obligations will be accredited. Generally, only accredited people will be able to quote effectively, a procedure which allows them to purchase personal computer and related goods tax&hyphen;free. The quote will also have to be authorised, a process designed to guard against the fraudulent use of accreditation numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a person is accredited, that person will be able to carry on trading in much the same way as he or she has done in the past, and the person's sales tax obligations will remain the same, except for the extra requirement that the quote must be authorised and there will be some extra record&hyphen;keeping and payment requirements. It is intended that authorisation will be available over the phone, so that it will not hinder trade unduly. Existing entitlements to end user exemptions will not be disturbed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, accredited people will take on extra obligations when they buy goods from unaccredited people. As a safeguard against attempts to frustrate these measures, there will be a requirement on accredited purchasers who purchase tax&hyphen;paid from unaccredited persons to withhold an amount, equivalent to the tax owing on the sale, from the purchase price and remit that amount to the Commissioner. Certain entities, such as public benevolent institutions will be exempted from the requirement for accreditation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If necessary, the withholding requirement will be extended to retailers who purchase goods from unaccredited wholesalers. This extension of the withholding arrangements to retailers will only come into effect if a review of the operation of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8612"> new regime indicates that such an extension is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not the first occasion on which serious sales tax fraud has occurred. In the past similar problems have arisen in relation to other goods including motor vehicles, video cassette recorders, amusement machines, and stereo equipment. The amendments have been developed to provide a general strengthening of the law to counter evasion. The scheme is designed to be flexible enough to apply to other goods if serious evasion is uncovered in other industries.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another measure in the bill contains the legislative rules for the new infrastructure borrowings tax rebate that was foreshadowed in the last Budget.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill I have just presented is a historic development for the parliament. It provides, for the first time, for the establishment and administration of a separate Parliamentary Service to support the operations of the houses of the Australian Parliament. The staff at present providing the parliament with its support services operate under administrative and staffing structures established by the Public Service Act 1922; however, it has been decided that the parliamentary administration should have its own legislation which recognises and mandates that the primary obligation of Parliamentary Service staff is to serve the parliament as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliamentary Service Bill follows as much as possible the philosophy, content and structure of the Public Service Bill 1997, which changes significantly the structure of public service employment, with certain modifications necessary to ensure the independence of the parliament from executive government. It establishes an employment framework which mirrors that proposed for the Australian Public Service generally and provides specifically for the reciprocal mobility of staff between the two services without loss of accrued entitlements. Arrangements will also be put in place to ensure mobility for staff currently engaged under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are significant differences between the Parliamentary and Public Service Bills which recognise that staff in parliamentary departments serve the houses of the parliament. That distinction is reflected in the first object of the bill which is to establish an apolitical Parliamentary Service that is  efficient and effective in serving the parliament. The Parliamentary Service Bill contains a statement of Parliamentary Service values and a Code of Conduct, provides for the appointment of a Parliamentary Service Commissioner, makes specific reference to the offices of Clerk of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, and provides for appointments to those offices. Tenure as clerk of either house will be for one 10-year period. The bill also stipulates conditions for earlier termination of those appointments. Occupants of the office may retire earlier once they attain the age of 55 years. Secretaries, other than clerks, are to be appointed by the Speaker and the President for five-year 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> terms with termination arrangements similar to those applying to secretaries of executive departments. There are transitional arrangements to ensure the continuation in office of current heads of parliamentary departments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also creates the new office of Parliamentary Service Commissioner with a role similar to that of the Public Service Commissioner. The Parliamentary Service Commissioner will have the task of advising the Presiding Officers with respect to the management practices and policies of the Parliamentary Service and, if requested by the relevant Presiding Officer, of investigating and reporting on specific issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In broad terms, the Presiding Officers will have the same employment powers as ministers under the Public Service Bill with advice from the Parliamentary Service Commissioner. Consistent with the need to preserve the independence of the clerks as impartial advisers, the Clerks of the House of Representatives and the Senate are not to be subject to direction from the Presiding Officers in relation to the nature of their advice provided with respect to either house, to members or to committees. Secretaries of parliamentary departments, including the clerks, cannot be directed in relation to the exercise of their powers in respect of specific individuals. The Presiding Officers will have the power to give secretaries of parliamentary departments, including the clerks, general directions relating to the management and leadership of the Parliamentary Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the bill provides specifically that the Parliamentary Service Commissioner is to be appointed separately and independently by the Presiding Officers, it is expected that normally the same person would fill both of these offices. This would assist in ensuring overall compatibility and consistency between the two services. However, the bill specifically provides that the commissioner cannot be subject to direction by executive government in relation to the Parliamentary Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secretaries of parliamentary departments, including the two clerks, are to have the same employment powers as those proposed for departmental secretaries in the Australian Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As mentioned earlier, the bill incorporates a legally enforceable Code of Conduct and a statement of Parliamentary Service values. These values reflect the fact that staff serve the houses but in other respects mirror those of the Public Service Bill, with a parallel reference to the requirement that employment decisions in the Parliamentary Service be based on merit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, this bill gives legislative effect to the decision that the parliamentary administration should not continue to be covered by the standard 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8614"> Australian Public Service Act. It establishes a statutory framework and administrative arrangements broadly consistent with those for the Public Service while incorporating the changes necessary to accommodate the unique circumstances of serving the houses. It provides the houses with a set of arrangements which will allow them to continue to attract and provide a career for those staff who will be equipped to deliver the high level of service the houses currently enjoy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government accepted recommendations made by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in its advisory report on the Public Service Bill 1997, and the Bill was amended accordingly by the House of Representatives. Parallel amendments were made in the relevant instances to the Parliamentary Service Bill in order to preserve the parallel nature of employment conditions and to ensure the unfettered operation of mobility between the two services. I present the revised explanatory memorandum and commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is the first report on contracting out of government services. I do note that the report is supported by a majority of members of the committee but that Senator Watson, Senator Ferris and Senator Lightfoot have dissented from it. The committee's report favours a cautious approach to outsourcing&mdash;and perhaps that is an understatement of our view. Outsourcing is just one option available to agencies seeking to improve the quality of their IT services. However, it is not a panacea 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8615"> for agencies seeking to save money or revamp their services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Experience and research literature from within Australia and around the world provide a wide range of outcomes&mdash;from total success to abject failure. However, the range of outcomes does support the theme of the report: getting outsourcing right can be a long and difficult process and agencies require the time, resources and supportive policy environment in which to operate&mdash;something this government appears not prepared to do. Indeed, outside of the government's ideological position, it appears not to even know what it is doing with regard to IT outsourcing. The government is doing so much of it on the run that even this report will probably appear a little out of date in some areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of particular note is the most recent announcement that OGIT will be transferred to the Office of Asset Sales. I am not quite sure where that will leave a lot of people within the industry. It clearly raises more questions than it answers in an area that really needs stability, requires caution and careful consideration. It would be very interesting for the committee to go back to the various agencies now and address that question of management of IT outsourcing. We may have to do this as part of our program of looking at the wider issues of competitive tendering and contracting out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee believes that the decision to outsource should be carefully considered on an agency by agency basis, that it requires a high degree of efficiency within the area considered for outsourcing prior to any decision so that the agency has a thorough grasp of costs and service requirements, and that the development of a business case and the conduct of market testing should allow the genuine option of not proceeding if the  projected outcomes cannot be met. The current ad hoc approach will not allow due process to take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee is also of the view that the government's position that savings targets must be met, irrespective of success or otherwise of outsourcing, will simply require agencies to deliver up the savings from other 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> areas of their operations which could&mdash;and more than likely will&mdash;result in poorer service and less efficiency. The government's cluster process appears to be in tatters and must have the IT industry wondering just how it will assist the development and growth of the Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Witnesses to the inquiry were concerned that this approach would favour a few large multinationals at the expense of small and medium sized enterprises: that is, it would limit the freedom of individual agencies within clusters to seek best outcomes for their specific requirements, that it would inhibit innovation and flexibility in IT development and that it could limit the ability of government to make significant policy changes and restructure administrative arrangements. In my view, all of these concerns are justified and the confusion surrounding the composition of cluster 3 only adds more weight to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's recent announcement on employment transition seeks to encourage the transfer of agency staff to the contractor. This is to be commended. However, the concern over jobs is not just in the public sector; there is grave concern in the private sector, especially in the small to medium enterprise area&mdash;the very section of industry that this government said its approach would provide so much benefit to. I think the end result will be much different. There are already signs appearing that not only will the government's IT outsourcing program not assist the development of new industry but it will more than likely lead to the demise of the existing industry already involved in the provision of IT services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Privacy and public accountability were two other areas of key concern. They received a large degree of airing. In terms of the outsourcing program, they will be very important also. The government's decision to ensure that no offshore processing of information is undertaken and that the Privacy Act will be amended to cover Commonwealth information held by contractors is welcomed but falls far short of what is really needed. The committee is of the view that no further outsourcing contracts should be let until satisfactory privacy measures are in place. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8616"> Frankly, I do not know how the government can proceed to finalise contracts without such measures in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Likewise, on the accountability front, the committee believes that outsourcing should not in any way diminish the level of accountability for the expenditure of public money and the exercise of public conferred authority. The responsibility to parliament for outsourced services must lie with the relevant minister in exactly the same way as it would for a service provided directly by the Public Service. The Auditor-General must have the necessary access and resources to examine outsourced services, and the jurisdiction of agencies such as the Ombudsman must extend to cover those services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee is particularly concerned about the practice of limiting the scrutiny of outsourcing contracts by making claims of commercial-in-confidence and believes that matters which directly and genuinely threaten the commercial interests of a company or agency should be covered by such claims. Evidence to the committee suggested that, in reality, justifiable claims would relate only to a relatively small part of most contracts. Therefore, the committee supports the publication of contracts with the minimum of excisions for reasons of confidentiality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the issues dealt with in this report have much wider relevance than the outsourcing of IT, and the committee will deal with them in greater detail in its second report. Finally, I again stress that the government's IT outsourcing program should be put on hold to enable a proper plan to be developed to ensure that there is a process that will achieve benefits for everyone, especially the Australian public. I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on the necessity for public ac countability for all government services provided by government contractors</EMPHASIS>  is a very important report, and I commend the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee on its preparation. It does show that the government's IT outsourcing program has been very rushed, ill-advised, inadequately planned and is very unlikely to deliver 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> anywhere near the savings that the government has promised. I think it vindicates our concerns about the whole process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Senate will be aware, the Australian Democrats initiated this inquiry because it was fairly obvious to us that the government was not only wasting a unique opportunity to build up a thriving local IT industry but also rushing into a tendering process with a half-baked cost analysis and against the advice of most government agencies. We think the savings from IT outsourcing that the government has already deducted from agency operating budgets are not at all certain. Last week's resignation by Dr Macdonald from the Office of Government Information Technology highlights the fact that the government has not thought this issue through. It has mostly been about outsourcing for outsourcing's sake. Because we are now well into the process, OGIT, the body that is supposed to shepherd in those changes, is being overhauled at just a moment's notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to highlight a couple of points which can be found in the report. The government failed to build in the true cost of redundancy packages or other termination methods into its budget predictions of massive savings. The cluster effect effectively locked out Australian small and medium enterprises because it was typified by very large contracts and, of course, overseas interest. There are very few provisions for safeguarding client privacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the more important findings of the report was that this commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence notion&mdash;that contracts must be kept secret from the public&mdash;was essentially blown out of the water by experiences from overseas and in particular from the United States. We found that agencies were not given any genuine say in whether or not they should outsource. I make the point that the Office of Government Information Technology seemed rather complacent in the belief that `the Commonwealth would succeed where others had not'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, if IT outsourcing is to be effective, it should be judged on an agency&hyphen;by&hyphen;agency basis. However, the clustering of agencies 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8617"> makes this extremely difficult. The Democrats are saying, like the opposition, that the government should halt its outsourcing program. We think it ought to stop until there is an opportunity for a thorough reassessment of the potential risks and benefits&mdash;something we have not heard much of to date. We have seen from the submissions to the inquiry that there is an inverse relationship between the time spent preparing contracts to the time spent later in litigation. A time frame of just two years means that there will probably be very many hasty and muddled decisions taken down the line and that that will cost taxpayers very dearly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The IT outsourcing program of this government reminds me quite a lot of what is going on in Victoria with local government&mdash;where competitive tendering has been made compulsory and where councils are forced into this process when there are very good reasons, both local and service wise, which would indicate that this should not go ahead. We are seeing much the same thing happen in regard to IT at the federal level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I once again commend this report as being very important and urge senators to read the material which is contained in it. We look forward to the balance of the inquiry into the contracting out of government services generally. I thank the committee for their work on this inquiry.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not surprisingly, this report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on the necessity for public accountability for all government services provided by government contractors</EMPHASIS>  is a highly&hyphen;charged political document. The majority report by the opposition members and the Democrats' member of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee failed to acknowledge the fact that outsourcing was a policy of the previous government. It is typical of the now opposition that it is taking  a completely different position when in opposition from the position it took in government. It is a highly&hyphen;charged political document. It is not surprising that the Liberal-National Party coalition senators have issued a very strong dissenting report. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe this majority report is flawed not only in relation to its approach to the subject but also in the evidence that was solicited. It used stolen evidence and relied far too heavily on that stolen evidence. Let me remind the Senate that the evidence was stolen from a cabinet submission and that that submission was only the start of the decision making process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report is flawed because the committee appeared not to be open&hyphen;minded about the terms of reference. The fundamental mind&hyphen;set of this approach is one of the major flaws of this particular document. It also fails to recognise that outsourcing is a worldwide trend. It has been pursued not only by the previous government but by governments around the world, and also by state governments and the private sector. It is not new.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are dealing with information technology. Where information technology is not core business&mdash;and it is not core business of governments&mdash;it is a service that is properly performed by specialists. I remind you that outsourcing of information technology has been adopted fully or partially by a number of state governments, including the South Australian, Victorian and Western Australian governments. It has also been pursued by some of Australia's largest companies that regard information technology as not being part of their core business&mdash;companies such as the Commonwealth Bank, Telstra, Qantas, MMI, Integral Energy and the Macquarie Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What concerns me is the manner in which evidence in this report has been quoted, even where favourable evidence was given to the committee. I refer to the Industry Commission evidence which said that, when done well, CTC can lead to significant improvements in accountability, quality and cost&hyphen;effectiveness, providing benefits to clients, taxpayers and the broader community. What did Senator Murphy and his members do? They took that positive comment and turned it around by highlighting the phrase `when done well'. That is a pretty infantile approach. We expect more than child's play and debating techniques on such a significant issue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8618">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area of concern to me, which I previously drew attention to, was the extensive use of an illegally obtained government submission and the use of that information in the conduct of the inquiry. It sets a very dangerous precedent, encouraging theft and the leaking of documents from Commonwealth departments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not matter whether you thieve or where you get it from, Senator Lundy, so long as you can make a political point&mdash;and a pretty poor one at that. The ability of governments to formulate and use confidential information underpins the fabric on which our democracy is built. I reject the argument of your interjection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We condemn the majority report's apparent disregard of evidence obtained from Commonwealth officers at the committee hearings in favour of your coordinated comments, together with illegally obtained information. The extensive use of stolen material can undermine the workings of parliamentary committees and the action is to be condemned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind you again that submissions from government departments are but the first of a long process in terms of the evolution of program or policy development to be pursued by government. It is selective use of that information. How are government officers going to react to this sort of behaviour&mdash;to the stealing of documents containing comments and submissions they have made to government through submissions to cabinet?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a retrograde step which does no credit to the opposition and Democrat members of this committee who so extensively used that information and embodied it in this report. It brings shame on the Senate and, particularly, on those members who used it so extensively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition seems to have been unaware of a report it wrote when it was in government called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Clients first</EMPHASIS>. This government has built extensively on that report in terms of information technology. We have a commit 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment to run government in an efficient manner to the benefit of taxpayers, and that requires businesses to focus on their core responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a government, we recognise that there is a shortage of personnel within the Australian Public Service. In order to make best use of these limited and scarce resources, a centralised approach is deemed to be the most efficient. What worried members of the government was the failure of the Labor Party and the Democrats to use any evidence from the state governments or from elements of the private sector which have outsourced. I believe that that failure must have accounted for a great deal of what I term the misinformation that was in Senator Murphy's report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murphy is not really across a lot of these areas. At the committee hearing he made the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would assume that the private sector has less conditions, lower wages and fewer jobs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Roche responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I certainly do not think that the first two are the case.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The private sector, as Senator Murphy obviously does not realise, usually pays very good wages, probably a lot better than those in the public sector. For him to come out with that remark shows a misunderstanding of this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are great opportunities for Australian participation in the SME. If your report was to be useful in any regard, you would have raised issues in relation to the setting of quotas, such as at what level. I remind you that the government is very sympathetic to privacy issues, but your government paid no regard at all to privacy issues in relation to the Department of Veterans' Affairs in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have ensured extensively that the privacy issues are foremost. The property that does go out to outsourcing remains the property of the government. Although it may be in the hands of contractors, it is still the property of government and we have all the resources of the Crimes Act, the Privacy Act and other acts to ensure that the privacy of individuals is protected.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Contracting out of government services&mdash;first report: information technology</EMPHASIS> . In the first instance, I would like to address a number of comments made by Senator Watson. The first point I would like to make is in respect of Senator Watson's comments about the federal Labor government and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Clients first</EMPHASIS> . There is no doubt that, when your government announced the IT outsourcing process, it fundamentally changed the principles and premise upon which <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Clients first</EMPHASIS>  was based. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Clients first</EMPHASIS>  specifically identifies, just as one example, a genuine competitive process to achieve some efficiencies with IT outsourcing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know, through the piggybacking of the DOF contract on the Department of Veterans' Affairs contract, that this government is not about achieving efficiencies through any competitive tendering process. It is about an ideological commitment to ditching the core provision of services by governments. That is what is driving it. For you to stand up here and pitifully claim that this is an ideological report ignores the report's substance. In fact, I would contend quite specifically that it is your quite insubstantial dissenting report that has the ideological spin on it, not our approach to the issues that we have systematically addressed on outsourcing throughout the body of the majority report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn to some of those main issues, and I would put to Senator Watson and to this government that there are a series of absolutely fundamental flaws in the approach to outsourcing. The first one is denying Australian businesses the opportunity to access government contracts. This is a funda mental flaw, in that you are not recognising the role of Australian industry in the IT sector. You are quite deliberately denying indigenous IT businesses the opportunity to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> build for themselves an innovative base so that they can grow and expand. You are relegating them to the position of being second best at the service, the whim and the beck and call of the multinational corporations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to focus on that particular issue because I know that there is a balance that must be struck between the participation of multinational corporations and indigenous companies, but this proposal excludes them quite specifically and compromises their position in Australian industry. We have heard it from them and we have even heard it from the larger corporations which are now saying from the other end of the argument, `We don't want to be hamstrung by a government which is trying to force us into these flawed partnership arrangements with local companies.' This is just one example of the flaws involved in your IT outsourcing process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us turn to another one: the privacy of the Australian citizen. If the management of information services and data is not a core competency or a core role of governments, then what is? What is our taxation system based on? It is based on the ability of the government to make assessments and measure. That requires the holding of incredibly sensitive and personal information. What about our health system? What about social security? Health and Social Security have an information database upon which they base their services provided to both the government and the citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have not provided adequate privacy guarantees. Your minister has said that he will enact privacy legislation to govern data held by companies on behalf of the Commonwealth. Have we seen this legislation? No, we have not. We have not seen even a bill proposing what is to be put in place. So this government is asking companies to tender for the outsourcing of government IT without even knowing the legislative parameters upon which their tender should be based. If that is not risking, denying and putting aside a sensible and practical degree of public accountability, what can you call it?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8620">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at another issue: the actual competitive tendering process. I raised this in my opening remarks. Throughout this whole process and throughout every contracting out argument I have heard from this government, governments in other states and the Industry Commission itself, it has been said that the principle of achieving efficiencies is based on a competitive tendering process. You need only to look at the whole argument and debate around the original privatisation of Telstra and so forth to see what priority your government places on competitive tendering. Yet in this case with IT outsourcing we do not have one example on the table of this government being prepared to engage in such a process. As for the one opportunity that existed, this government chose to specifically bypass competitive tendering and utilise quite an obscure clause within the interim procurement guidelines of DAS to hang a contract on. That issue has not even been delved into, I believe, with the degree necessary to ensure probity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That particular tender, the extension of the Department of Finance on to the DVA contract, raises all sorts of questions about the credibility of the program. Credibility affects public accountability, and if public credibility is not there how can taxpayers be assured of the process having some sort of validity and having some sort of safeguard mechanism to know that their money is being well spent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that this government fails to recognise is that you cannot treat information services as just a commodity, as just a service. It is more than that. It is an enabling technology. Information technology is not just the hardware. You cannot delineate the hardware from the software or the strategy controlling how information technology is managed within a given agency. To do that fundamentally ignores what IT is all about. It is enabling technology, it is a way of achieving efficiencies and it is a way of progressing innovation within a given organisation. So you are denying the agencies from doing that and actually progressing and improving the  services that they provide and, in turn, doing a better job for government in achieving savings.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to say with respect to this public accountability that the savings are not there. You say that you have cited evidence that the savings are there. We have not based our report on those savings because it depends on which study you read. But I will say this: the studies that show there are savings in outsourcing are not primarily focused on IT; they are focused on municipal functions. If you look at the studies based on IT outsourcing, you will find that barely 50 per cent are successful in delivering savings. A high proportion of those that do deliver savings have nominated and identified a specific dropping or lowering of services to the client. So you cannot base your argument on the reports.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some concerns about the exemption being provided to the Child Care Payments (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1997. I have attempted to have some discussions about this matter with the minister's office. However, despite expressions of concern, there does not seem to be any real, forthright feedback coming back from the office. Essentially, the difficulty is the period of disclosure of this bill prior to the attempted debate and, in particular, the period of disclosure for the disallowable instruments and other subordinate legislation referred to which are fundamentally part of the way this bill is going to be implemented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These pieces of subordinate legislation were first requested when the bill was introduced some approximately six weeks ago. I have to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8621"> say that I understand there was some rush and that the department was under some pressure to produce these documents. I suppose the length of time they took is understandable. I do not have any great difficulty with that. The difficulty I have is that there is an attempt to debate this bill when we really have had no time to examine these pieces of subordinate legislation. To put it on the record, I have to say that these pieces of subordinate legislation were provided to us in three lots. I received the last group of subordinate legislation on Thursday last week. I do not think this is a very reasonable time to allow an examination and real scrutiny of these pieces of subordinate legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My particular concern is not just that I do not have proper time to examine them but that those involved in the industry, such as in the child-care centres, both community based and private, and in before&hyphen; and after&hyphen;school care have also not had an opportunity to properly look at this subordinate legislation, make comments and get feedback. Those members of the child&hyphen;care industry have expressed a very strong desire to me. Parents are concerned about exactly how this bill will be implemented and what is contained in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are not just one or two pieces of subordinate legislation; I want to make this very clear. If that were the case, these problems could have been overcome in a few days. There are 28 pieces of quite lengthy subordinate legislation. Just to give you an idea of how much that is, this large folder contains those pieces of subordinate legislation. They deal with a huge range of issues, some of which are, I suppose, reasonably trivial in that they only apply to a small group of people. However, others are quite fundamental to the way that this bill will operate and how the changes to the child-care industry will be brought about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They deal with things such as the definition of `inhabitants of Australia' for the purposes of child-care assistance and the child-care rebate. They deal with what the work train ing&hyphen;Austudy test is. This is a limitation that will be imposed on parents who are not working or who are in training or studying. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They will be allowed to have access to only 20 hours of child care per week. So that test is of fundamental importance to a whole raft of parents who are affected by this legislation. To not have that subordinate legislation available for examination and comment well before the debate of the bill makes it extraordinarily difficult for that group of people and the industry as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might mention for the benefit of Senator Herron that that aspect is of huge importance to the child-care industry in Queensland. A lot of members involved there, particularly in the private sector, are very concerned about that definition and how it will be imposed. So it is not something that is airy&hyphen;fairy or only involving people here in the Senate. It has very strong and important ramifications for those involved in the child-care industry at the grassroots level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also defines, pursuant to section 18 within the subordinate legislation, what a session of care is. Those people who are involved in the child-care industry or who have had a long interest in the area may be aware of the long debate about what is actually a session of care. For some time, we have retained a session of care, which is essentially a whole day. But there have been very clear indications from this government that there is a movement to reduce the session of care to perhaps half a day or less. In some cases, there is a feeling that this government may be looking at reducing it to an hour. That may not be the case, but certainly those involved in the industry would very much like to see what the intentions of this government are in relation to defining `session of care' when debating this bill. They want to see how it will be implemented out in the real world in the child-care industry and what effect it will have on the type of care that is being provided by the child-care industry for children whom parents choose to place in child-care centres. There are also subordinate regulations related to the assets test. The date of effect of determination is not yet very clear to anyone. It relates to how child-care assistance and the child-care rebate are paid.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8622">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are guidelines in relation to defining emergency care, again an issue of quite some controversy within the child&hyphen;care industry. There are conditions that should be taken into account in determining whether a child&hyphen;care centre has breached eligibility rules, again obviously something of major importance to child&hyphen;care centres. There are guidelines relating to the allocation of child&hyphen;care assistance hours. That means determining how many children each child&hyphen;care centre can get and what are the guidelines to determine that. Obviously, for a child&hyphen;care centre that is presently operating, it is fundamentally important to know how many child&hyphen;care assistance hours they will provided with. For centres that may be considering opening up in the future, again it may determine whether or not they will be viable. I could go on at some length. As I said, there are 28 of them: some of them of quite major importance; some of them of lesser importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, we need more than two working days in order to properly examine them and liaise with the industry. I would not mind actually receiving from the minister some indication as to whether these pieces of subordinate legislation have been distributed to the industry and, if so, to whom, and what their comments have been to date. Certainly, I do not believe that two days is adequate. Bearing that in mind, the opposition will not be agreeing to the cut&hyphen;off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do acknowledge that the government has deferred the implementation of the bill from 1 January to 27 April and we congratulate you for doing that. Hopefully, to some extent that will reduce the chaos that may have been brought about by the attempted implementation on 1 January. But I still believe that it is being unnecessarily rushed and that it would be proper for the government to take a bit more time to allow a bit  more discussion and liaison on these issues.</PARA></SPEECH>

If the bills are not passed in the current sittings, given that the next sittings will not commence until March 1998 the new arrangements could not commence until June 1998 at the earliest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This delay would have a number of detrimental effects. It would generate uncertainty in the child&hyphen;care industry and it would further defer important policy changes including the reform of outside school hours care support arrangements to provide greater assistance to lower income families. It would defer policy changes to limit child&hyphen;care assistance for non&hyphen;work related purposes to 20 hours per week, the aim of which is to free up places for other children not currently able to obtain care. It would also defer the policy changes that implement planning arrangements for new private sector services, which are strongly supported by the industry, and link child&hyphen;care payments to the immunisation of children, which I think Senator Neal would agree is of fundamental importance. Of course, it would also reduce the savings available from the implementation of the new policy, so I take the points made by Senator Neal.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue relates now to the unannounced policies which would be permitted under the amendments moved by the Labor Party. Requests could be made for a range of alternative policy options to be costed. We consider that this risks placing the departments of Treasury and Finance in the position of developing policies for the opposition in a way which we believe is inconsistent with the usual conventions. Apart from that, it would certainly add substantially to the workload of departments which could be required to cost a myriad of alternative policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was never the intention of the charter of budget honesty which, as I have said, acts as a restriction on government because it makes sure that there is transparency, particularly in relation to fiscal accounts. We therefore are not able to accept the amendments which have been moved by the Labor Party.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those amendments have been accepted by the Senate. The motion now is that the Senate not insist upon the amendments to the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill which it had previously adopted.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had this debate before question time. I must say that I have not changed my mind. The reasons are not such that I would change my mind on this matter. I hope that the government takes this with good grace and accepts the amendments so that ultimately we do have charter of budget honesty legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that it is unfortunate that sometimes there is a focus on the negative in this chamber. This was a positive initiative by the government. We all congratulate the government on this positive initiative. Overall, I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8624"> think the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill was a very meritorious piece of legislation and something that should have been done some years ago. It has taken this government to bite the bullet, as it were. I do not want the government to feel that we are unduly negative in insisting upon these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want it to be thought by anyone that we in any way are attempting to denigrate what the government has decided to do&mdash;that is, to propose and pursue a charter of budget honesty. It is not going to be easy for them; it is going to be more difficult for them. Of course it is going to make difficulties for the Public Service, but things will be far more transparent, we hope, as a result of this measure. I do believe that the amendments by the Senate have, to some extent, improved the bill. I hope that, ultimately, the government might see its way clear to accepting them.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Public Service is a great institution. It is a vital part of our system of democratic governance. It plays a crucial role in providing advice to government on the development of its policies. It lies at the heart of accountability for the way in which the decisions of government are implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, like many of our national institutions, the APS is showing signs of age. This is no reflection on the calibre or commitment of individual public servants. Far too often the creativity and innovation of those who work within the Service are being undermined by inflexible work systems and process-driven procedures. The Public Service Act, enacted in 1922 and amended on a piecemeal basis more than a hundred times since, is a key reason for that. It looks to a bygone age rather than forward to the next century. The Act&mdash;together with regulations, awards and agreements preserves a rule-bound culture that emphasises control of inputs rather than effectiveness of outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The previous government, to its credit, recognised that truth. Our Government, hopefully with bipartisan support, intends to address it. If we do not, then taxpayers will pay the costs through inefficient and expensive work practices and the public will have less access to the services they need when they need them. Equally important, the APS will provide a less rewarding environment for those who work within it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I acknowledge that over the last decade the APS has already undergone significant change. Yet more, much more, needs to be done. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is committed to achieving significant micro-economic reform. That involves removing unnecessary red-tape from business, providing greater workplace flexibility, encouraging a direct relationship between employers and employees and providing the incentives necessary to encourage improved industry performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reform of public administration is a key part of that process. Until recently the APS had a monopoly in the provision of government services. Effectively it enjoyed a protective barrier from more efficient competitors. Now, as the provision of public services becomes contestable, the pressures for structural adjustment in public administration are great.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are, of course, some fundamental distinctions between the public and private sectors. The private sector is responsive to the market. It delivers goods and services to customers. The public sector is, within the framework of ministerial responsibility, accountable to the public. It provides services, often entitlements, to citizens. The high  ethical standards required of public servants reflect those differences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But recognition of this essential truth should not blind us to the fact that the manner in which APS workplaces are organised and people are managed is subject to the same economic, social and technological pressures that face other Australian businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maintaining and revitalising a career public service is a key part of our Government's strategy to improve Australia's governance and prepare it for the future. That, in particular, is why our Government has sought to give a priority to the process of public service reform as an integral element of its broader industrial reform agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our commitment to reform is reflected in the passage of new financial management legislation, the introduction of Government Service Charters and the promotion of more flexible employment arrangements under the Workplace Relations Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The modernisation of the principal legislation regulating the Australian Public Service, the Public Service Act 1922, is a vital element of this public service reform agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 26 June 1997, Minister Reith introduced into Parliament a Bill to replace the current legislative framework for the establishment and management of the Australian Public Service. This Bill proposes a modern Act, embodying a new approach to protecting the public interest of citizens, while providing a far more flexible framework for the management of employees. It seeks to replace an Act which is generally accepted to be out-dated, excessively complex, overly prescriptive and unnecessarily centralist in its perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Bill will provide a legislative basis for APS employment which will allow the APS to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8626"> provide better policy advice to the Government and higher quality, more accessible services to the community. It will encourage the APS to seek maximum value for public funds rather than minimise risk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill emphasises the distinctive ethos of Australia's public administration and Parliament's expectations of the public service. The Bill will maintain the Service's integrity and professionalism by setting statutory values and a code of conduct that must be upheld by all public servants. This will strengthen the traditional ethos of public service and remedy the manifest shortcomings of the current legislation. The 1997 Bill establishes a framework for an apolitical and non-partisan public service. In contrast the 1922 Act is silent on such fundamental matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Bill provides a fair balance between enhanced accountability and devolved management responsibility. It establishes that employment powers within APS agencies rest with their chief executives and vests in them greater authority to meet the distinctive needs of their own organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agency Heads will be given the power, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to engage persons as employees. Within the law, it is they who will determine many of the conditions which attach to employment. It is they who will assign duties or terminate employment. This will provide Secretaries and Agency Heads with the flexibility needed to provide more rewarding jobs for their staff and to develop employment arrangements tailored to the expectations of the clients they serve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be those who seek to characterise these changes as diminishing the fairness with which employees are treated in the APS. This is, of course, a nonsense. The new Act will not erode the position of employees in terms of dealing with their employer. They will have access to the same protections in dealing with their employer as apply to the rest of the Australian workforce under the Workplace Relations Act. In addition they will be managed under an umbrella of APS values which guard their rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The vast majority of provisions in the current Public Service Act will no longer be required. Detailed control over matters such as transfer, promotion, advancement, suspension, leave of absence, mobility and re-integration will be removed. So, too, will most of the provisions relating to the management of misconduct, discipline and performance. These are matters that are best resolved at the workplace level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed the devolution of employment powers will provide public servants with far greater freedom than they have ever enjoyed before. The conditions of their employment will be tailored to the particu 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lar circumstances of their own workplace without unnecessary legislative restriction or central regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Devolving employment decisions will provide a firm foundation for co-operative workplace relations based on genuine consultation and direct communication.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister and Public Service Minister will continue to have appropriate powers to ensure that the interests of the Service as a whole are protected. The Public Service Minister, for example, may, subject to the application of awards, determine the remuneration and other conditions of service where it is desirable because of special circumstances. The Minister may also make rules about the classification of APS employees. These powers will ensure that an effective balance can be struck between devolution to agencies and Service-wide cohesion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time as it devolves management responsibility, the Bill ensures that the powers vested in Agency Heads are exercised appropriately. The Bill provides for enhanced Parliamentary scrutiny and greater public accountability. It requires Agency Heads to uphold and promote the values of the APS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill sets out the public interest. It also provides new mechanisms for its protection. To this end, the Bill, together with the subordinate legislation, provides the Public Service Commissioner with far greater powers of review, investigation and report than are provided by the current Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner will be required to uphold the traditional ethos of public service, ensure appropriate standards of behaviour for public servants and maintain public confidence in the way they do their business. The Bill provides the Commissioner with considerable powers to review, evaluate and make recommendations on APS employment policies or practices, either at the Minister's request or at her or his own instigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Bill, the Commissioner will issue Directions in relation to the APS Values to ensure that the APS incorporates the Values. Agency Heads and APS employees will be required to comply with these Directions, as well as with the APS Values and Code of Conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner will also be required to report to Parliament each year on the state of the Australian Public Service. She or he will be able to report at any other time on particular matters that are deemed to warrant it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill makes provision for the creation of bodies to be known as executive agencies. This will provide a more satisfactory arrangement than the present use of section 67 of the Constitution where the Government wishes to establish an organisation with a degree of separateness from a minister's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8627"> department and where no statutory powers are required to be exercised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Public Service Bill has undergone extensive scrutiny by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I am pleased that the Committee supported the need for the present Act to be replaced and favoured the simplification, modernisation and more accessible format of the new Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report of the JCPA made a number of unanimous recommendations. The Government proposes to adopt, in whole or in part, the twenty recommendations made by the Committee. The Government has also given close consideration to the substantive comments contained in the report but which were not expressed formally as recommendations and, in one crucial matter, intends to accept the Committee's views.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the House of Representatives, the Government moved sixteen amendments to the original Public Service Bill and five amendments to the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Bill in order to pick up a number of the recommendations of the JCPA. Those amendments were accepted without dissent by the House of Representatives. Let me now indicate how the Bill has been amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has been persuaded that the APS Values can be further strengthened. In particular, the Bill now recognises explicitly the need for Secretaries to provide advice to Government which is "frank, honest, comprehensive and accurate" as well as "timely". It also places accountability in the context of Ministerial responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JCPA also asked that clauses 13 and 15 of the Bill, which relate to the APS Code of Conduct, be further considered. Changes have been made to the Bill as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much of the evidence given before the JCPA related to the status of Secretaries. This is somewhat perplexing since, as the Committee noted, the tenure of Secretaries will not be changed by the new Act. The Public Service Act was amended during the Opposition's term of office to allow a Secretary's appointment to be terminated. It was during those years, too, that the policy was introduced that all future appointments of Secretaries would be fixed term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JCPA supported the continuation of the current arrangements. I agree with this conclusion. In the experience of the Government, Secretaries are as frank and fearless in their advice today as they were in the 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Public Service Bill proposes that the Prime Minister set the remuneration of Secretaries, and that agency Ministers set the remuneration of the Heads of Executive Agencies, usually after seeking the advice of the Remuneration Tribunal. On the recommendation of the JCPA, the remuneration set 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for Agency Heads will be made public in the annual financial statements of Commonwealth agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JCPA also proposed, and the Government agrees, that Secretaries and Heads of Executive Agencies must prepare annual reports in accordance with the general requirements of the JCPA. The Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill has been amended to indicate this requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill retains the concept of the Senior Executive Service (SES) and includes for the first time a clear statement of the Service-wide role of the SES. While Agency Heads will have enhanced responsibilities in relation to the SES, the Public Service Commissioner will be required to issue Directions about employment matters relating to SES employees. These will cover appropriate selection processes, in order to ensure that decisions are made on the basis of merit, and termination processes, including a requirement to certify that a termination is in the best interests of the Service. This will address JCPA concerns that SES employees should be free from any apprehension that they may be dismissed for providing robust advice to their Agency Head. I emphasise that the Directions, just as the regulations, are legislative instruments which Parliament can disallow.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill introduces a streamlined approach to the review of employment actions. The JCPA concluded that there is a clear need for a revision, of the current grievance and appeal mechanisms. The present review system contains too many avenues of appeal, resulting in complicated and convoluted processes. The responsibility to afford public servants a right of review of employment decisions needs to be balanced against the need to reduce the costs associated with a grievance-based workplace culture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I emphasise that the Bill does not propose&mdash;and has never sought&mdash;the abolition of external review. It explicitly provides public servants with a right to seek review of any APS action that relates to their employment and allows for independent external review from outside their own agency. The detail of the review processes and the particular rights afforded to staff will be set out in the new Public Service Regulations. With due regard to the recommendation of the JCPA, these provisions have been made simpler, clearer and more concise than the draft they considered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the JCPA made no recommendation on the matter, it expressed a view that it was appropriate for the Public Service Commissioner to set standards and review Service-wide performance. However, to address any perception of a conflict of interest, it suggested that in addition there should be a Merit Protection Commissioner, with separate statutory powers, to review individual employment actions. The Government has agreed to take up this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8628"> suggestion, and the Bill has been amended accordingly. It reflects a significant amendment to the original Bill and has been made only after the most careful consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Merit Protection Commissioner will be able to investigate a complaint and, much like the Commonwealth Ombudsman, make recommendations to an Agency Head on how it should be addressed. If not satisfied with the response the Merit Protection Commissioner will report that conclusion to the Public Service Commissioner who will have the power to report to the Minister and, if necessary, to Parliament. These represent very substantial powers of review and scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear from my remarks that merit selection will remain a fundamental principle in selection decisions under the Bill. Indeed the Bill specifically prohibits patronage or favouritism in staffing, and prevents Ministers from involving themselves in staffing decisions relating to particular individuals. The JCPA recommended that the definition of merit should be included in the Bill rather than, as originally proposed, in the subordinate legislation. That recommendation has been accepted and the Bill was amended in the House to include a definition of merit which is based upon suggestions made by the Womens' Electoral Lobby and supported by the JCPA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another important element of the Bill is the protection that it provides for the first time to public interest whistleblowers. Until now public interest whistleblowers in the APS have not had an established mechanism to hear allegations of misconduct within the Service. To remedy that defect, the Bill provides that those public servants who believe they have evidence of fraud or misconduct will now be able to make reports to their Agency Head or the Public Service Commissioner, an approach which&mdash;unlike the leaking of confidential information on government business&mdash;will serve to protect the public interest. The Bill also provides whistleblowers with legislative protection against victimisation or discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JCPA recommended that the Government should consider widening this whistleblowers' legislation beyond the APS. The Government has agreed to this recommendation and has referred the matter to the Attorney-General for his consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important new initiative of this Bill is the requirement that each Agency Head must establish a workplace diversity program. While these programs will operate to ensure that workplaces are free from discrimination, they will go further than the arrangements in the current legislation for Equal Employment Opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The programs will recognise that a Service which values and uses the diverse backgrounds and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> perspectives of its employees is likely to be more productive and creative. The need to better balance work and family responsibilities through the development of appropriate workplace systems and structures will be an important aspect of a workplace diversity program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important for Parliament to be able to assess the effectiveness of these programs. The JCPA recommended that the Public Service Commissioner's Directions should require Agency Heads to evaluate the outcomes of their workplace diversity programs and to provide the Commissioner with all the information necessary to carry out comparisons of the programs on an agency-by-agency basis. The Government accepts that these proposals will strengthen public scrutiny of the programs, and they are now included in the Direction on Diversity in Employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current Public Service Act gives various rights of return to those who leave the APS to work with other Commonwealth bodies. These mobility provisions are lengthy and complex. They represent a considerable liability for public service agencies. The Government's intention is to provide agencies with the discretion to determine arrangements that best meet their needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mobility rights of those people who are covered by the current provisions will be preserved for a transitional period. The JCPA has recommended that the transitional period should be extended from one year to three. The Government has agreed to this proposal, and the transitional regulations made under the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill will include a transitional period of three years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that mobility of staff between agencies is specifically provided for in the Bill. Employees will still be able to move from one APS agency to another on promotion or transfer without having to resign or be re-engaged. The Classification Rules, by grouping similar classification levels, will facilitate mobility across the Service. The Bill also continues in a simplified form the current provisions for the movement of APS employees where the Government has made machinery of government changes or administrative rearrangements. Similarly, the Public Service Commissioner will retain the power to compulsorily transfer employees between agencies where they are excess.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importance of the role of Parliament in scrutinising the administration of the APS is acknowledged in this Bill. It requires the independence of Parliament and those who work for it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliamentary Departments are not covered by the Public Service Bill. Instead, it is proposed that they will operate under their own Parliamentary Service Act. It is the Government's view that the independence of the Parliament and its employees 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8629"> can best be recognised by establishing a separate statutory regime for those who work in the Parliamentary Departments and, for that reason, it supports the Bill brought to the Senate by its Presiding Officer. I am pleased that the Parliamentary Service Bill reflects the new approach set out in the Public Service Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of a separate Parliamentary Service also has the support of the JCPA. However the Committee recommended that reciprocal mobility arrangements between the two Services be introduced. The Government agrees. Senators will find that the Parliamentary Service Bill provides for such mobility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me conclude.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government, like its predecessor, recognises the urgent need to overhaul the legislation under which public servants work. The Government is committed to broadening and accelerating the process of public service reform begun in the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The task is daunting. It requires us to change the workplace systems, structures and most importantly&mdash;culture of the APS. It means building on the finest traditions of Australian public service, its non-partisan professionalism and high ethical standards, in order to meet better the demands of the Australian public, and provide more rewarding jobs for its employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every institution&mdash;including the APS&mdash;needs to be reviewed periodically, to have dismantled the accretion of unnecessary rules and regulations which emphasise process, and to be invigorated by the rearticulation of its purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is what the Government intends with the legislation before the Senate today. It sets a firm foundation for an APS of high performance organisations, able to contribute policy advice, implement legislation and oversight the delivery of government programs in an efficient, effective and ethical manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is my strong view that the Public Service Bill, complemented by the Parliamentary Service Bill will provide the opportunity for the APS to renew itself for the benefit of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bills to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL) AMENDMENT BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997 deals with the consequential and transitional matters arising from the proposed repeal of the Public Service Act 1922 and its replacement by the legislation set out in the Public Service Bill 1997. With the establishment of the new legal framework for APS employees set 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> out in the Public Service Bill, certain provisions will be necessary:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to enable the transition from the old to the new employment framework;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to validate actions and decisions taken under the former legislation; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to make consequential amendments to the extensive range of legislation which incorporates references to the Public Service Act 1922.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transitional provisions fall into three broad areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, it is necessary to set in place conversion arrangements for those who work in the APS . With the removal of the concept of office for APS staff and the creation of a single employment category officers and employees covered by the existing Act are converted to employees in their corresponding agencies with their corresponding classifications. Fixed-term Secretaries to Departments under the old Act will become Secretaries of their corresponding Departments under the new Act. Similarly the person holding office as the Public Service Commissioner under the existing Act will become the Public Service Commissioner under the new Act as if he had been appointed under the new Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, as the Public Service Bill 1997 is primarily principles-based, there are some conditions covered by the Public Service Act 1922 that require transitional arrangements because they will no longer be regulated in the same way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most important of these are the arrangements governing the rights of return of staff who have left the APS to take up non-APS public employment. The current, very complex, legislative conditions represent a considerable liability for APS agencies. They will be replaced, subject to appropriate transitional arrangements, with a simpler model under which Agency Heads will agree to extend unpaid leave to employees to take up such employment where this is in the interest of the APS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliamentary Service Bill 1997 which sets in place a framework for the Parliamentary Departments will also be before the Senate at this time and in the event that Bill does not secure passage, appropriate transitional arrangements for the Parliamentary Departments are provided in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, there is a need to provide for the continuation of processes already set in train. Action may have commenced under the Public Service Act 1922 or the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984 that will not be completed by the time the new Public Service Act is proclaimed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to matters such as appointments, promotions, suspensions, transfers and advancements, as well as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8630"> to appeals, grievances and other reviews of employment decisions. To enable action to be completed, regulations will be made to ensure the continuation of those processes after the new Act is proclaimed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The validation of actions and decisions taken under the former legislation will be largely dealt with in regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to the consequential amendments, the Acts specified in Schedule 1 to this Bill will be amended or repealed as set out in that Schedule. The amendments can be divided into the following categories:</PARA>

It is not intended to increase the level of remuneration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to any special requirements in relation to particular consequential amendments, this Bill will commence on the same day as the Public Service Act 1997. Where this Bill amends an Act which has not yet commenced, the amending provision in the Schedule to this Bill will commence immediately after the commencement of that other Act.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset may I convey my congratulations to Senator Troeth on her recent appointment as a parliamentary secretary. This legislation, the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997, enacts transitional arrangements as part of the process of restructuring the Australian Wheat Board and the marketing and pooling arrangements in the wheat industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This process started under the previous Labor government and therefore it is a process that we support. The objectives of this process and particularly of the legislation are to remove the restrictions of government control and regulation and to give the wheat 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8631"> growers greater ownership and control of wheat marketing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of this process of restructuring of the Australian Wheat Board and the marketing of wheat, particularly for export, is outlined in the second reading speech of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) and is also detailed in the Senate rural and regional affairs committee report. I particularly refer to chapter 1 of that Senate committee report, which gives a detailed analysis of the history, a history&mdash;I repeat, for Senator McGauran's benefit&mdash;that commenced with decisions made by the Australian Labor Party when in government to bring about much needed long&hyphen;term change for the wheat industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we support the thrust, the purpose of the changes that are envisaged in this legislation. As I said, that process began under an ALP government. It actually began in 1984 and, more particularly, with legislation enacted in 1989. But having reached this point where we are almost on the threshold of finality of the changes, there is a major problem with this legislation. I wish to go to the problems of this legislation, because there are major concerns in the industry that, if this legislation is enacted without some of the key problems being resolved, then growers are fearful of the future of their industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point to make is that the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997 that is before us tonight is the first tranche of legislation. It is intended&mdash;and indeed it has been announced by the minister in his speech and also in evidence before the committee&mdash;that further legislation is to be brought before the parliament next year to complete the process of restructuring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence has been given to the Senate committee that it would be better if the entire package of legislation&mdash;that is, this legislation and the legislation that it is intended to introduce next year&mdash;were put before the parliament as one complete package rather than be dealt with in the two&hyphen;step process that the government has proposed. After consideration of the evidence put before the Senate committee and concerns expressed by the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry, that is also the view of the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset, we support the thrust of the legislation and we support the process that is involved, but we do believe that it would be far better if this legislation were postponed, deferred, even withdrawn, and brought back as a complete package of legislation when the second tranche of legislation is due to be brought before the parliament next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer to, firstly, comments made by the minister in his second reading speech and, secondly, some of the evidence put before the Senate committee. In his second reading speech the minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The restructure of the Australian Wheat Board brings to fruition a process dating back to 1989 aimed at putting ownership and control of wheat marketing firmly in growers' hands. This will enable industry to control its own future without the restrictions of government control and regulation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to acknowledge that the restructure of the Australian Wheat Board has been driven by the grains industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The problem with the minister's glowing statements at that time about bringing to fruition this process of deregulation and enhancing grower control is that that is not what this legislation does at all. As I said, there is further legislation to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, and more importantly, his statement that the restructure of the Australian Wheat Board has been driven by the grains industry is not borne out by the evidence presented to the Senate committee. Further, it is not borne out by the most recent communications that I have received&mdash;I am sure other senators and members of the government have received them as well&mdash;from the major grower organisations in this country calling on the parliament to defer finalisation of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the explanatory memorandum, set out in the general outline, is an analysis of the impact of this bill. Time does not permit me to read that out in detail, but honourable senators no doubt perused it when considering this legislation. What is the current situation? 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8632"> The current situation is that the major grower organisations representing wheat growers in this country, namely, the Western Australian Farmers Federation and the New South Wales Farmers Association, are calling on this government, calling on this parliament, to defer this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are their reasons? As I said, this is but part one of two tranches of legislation. The industry is apprehensive and concerned that, without having before them the entire package of legislation which will set out in full detail the way in which the industry will ultimately be restructured, they may be buying a pig in a poke; they may be putting their signature on the line to a structure that ultimately may not be in their best interests. Clearly it is not open to the government to submit, as it has done, that this bill and this process come with the support of the industry. It may come with the support of the Wheat Board, but it certainly does not come with the support of the major organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is particularly important because at least two major issues are unresolved. Firstly, the question of taxation and, secondly, the question of the future of the single desk. In relation to the future of the single desk, the government continues to give assurances that that is not at risk. But there are serious questions about the company, the corporation, that will replace the Wheat Board and the wheat industry fund once the process of restructuring is completed. The corporation may well run into significant problems with its listing on the Australian Stock Exchange. I know my colleague Senator O'Brien is going to deal with that in a little more detail later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern overlays all this. There is to be a review of that monopoly export power in the year 2000 by virtue of the national competition policy process. We have a situation where growers, whilst generally supportive of deregulation and greater ownership and control of wheat marketing in this country, are apprehensive that at the moment this process is only half complete. There are serious questions still to be resolved, and growers have not yet seen the full package of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legislation that the government ultimately intends to submit to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will quickly summarise the technical details of the legislation. The legislation provides for the establishment of a holding company and two subsidiaries which will be wholly owned by the Australian Wheat Board and be responsible for wheat marketing and financing. The holding company will be known as company A, and it will be structured with both A and B&hyphen;class shares. A&hyphen;class shares will be issued to growers. B&hyphen;class shares will be issued to those holding equity in the current wheat industry fund, and that equity will form the capital base of the company. It is intended ultimately in these next few years to use that company and its capital base to drive the financing of the eventual marketing body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those holding A&hyphen;class shares, that is, the wheat growers, will have the voting rights to elect the majority of the directors of the holding company. Those holding B&hyphen;class shares will have the right to elect the minority of directors. During the period of transitional arrangements, which lasts until 30 June 1999, the Australian Wheat Board will still have responsibility for the export monopoly, that is, the single desk will continue. However, there is grave concern that, once that date is reached and the government's underwriting ceases to exist and as a result of the national competition policy process, the single desk facility may be at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a range of other technical aspects to this bill, but again time does not permit me to go through them in detail. However, I direct the attention of senators to the report of the Senate committee. I will quote a couple of examples of the evidence that was given by a substantial number of witnesses or organisations to the committee. Firstly, I will quote Mr Wilson Tuckey, a Western Australian member who represents a large number of wheat growers. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I am really saying to you is that, even then, I do not think that is a good deal for wheat growers. I think it is a lousy deal, because I do not think those votes have got any value in this structure. I am really saying that the whole thing should be packaged together. You can chuck this piece of legislation out and nothing changes until we have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8633"> got a complete package that is given proper scrutiny in the parliament and deals with all these other aspects.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Wilson Tuckey went on to give quite extensive evidence detailing his concerns, particularly about the issues related to future listing of the company on the Stock Exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Moffet, the Grain Section President of the Western Australian Farmers Federation, also gave detailed evidence. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the last working group meeting&mdash;and, for those senators who may not be aware, the working group is a body of the Australian Wheat Board, DPIE and the Grains Council of Australia&mdash;where we as an industry were trying to ensure that the period between 1997 and 1999 was a period in which the new structures will start to be reflected in the management systems of the Australian Wheat Board, it was made very clear that a conflict occurs between what is called the interim operational plan of the AWB for this period and the expectation of both government and industry for the post-1999 period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our concern is that, if management systems are not set in place and made operational within the AWB in this two-year period, where at least there is some government overseeing of the operations of the AWB, then it is almost impossible post-1999 to change that inherent management system, because it will be a board answerable only to its shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to detail extensive concern. I must remind senators that Western Australia is our major wheat exporting state. Some 66 per cent of the total wheat exported comes out of that state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key issue is this question of taxation. I will try to quickly summarise it for senators. As I said earlier, the equity that wheat growers hold in the wheat industry fund will be converted to shares in the holding company. They will then, of course, become tradeable on the Stock Exchange if and when the company is so listed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A major concern of the growers who belong to those funds is that the tax liability that they may be subject to in the future has still not been resolved. I understand there have been assurances given on a number of occasions that that would be resolved, but it has not been resolved yet. The Treasurer (Mr Costello), the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, and the government have given 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> assurances about what ultimately will happen to the tax liability of the growers' own funds, which currently make up the wheat industry fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have received correspondence in the last two days. I received a letter from the Western Australian Farmers Federation, which wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator,</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to my correspondence of 29 October seeking your support in deferring the above Bill. You will recall there were two major unresolved issues that I identified, they being:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> tax liabilities that wheat growers Australia wide may be exposed to have still not been clarified by the Federal Treasurer,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> it appears that listing on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), something this Bill will facilitate, will only be possible if growers' control of the AWB is relinquished. This fundamental objective (that is, control) is the key to wheat growers' support for this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They go on to say that in light of this they are seeking that the bill be deferred. I have similar correspondence from the New South Wales Farmers Federation. They wrote today asking for our urgent support for deferral of the bill for the very same reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we actually have are growers not supporting this legislation, even though the government says it is an integral part of the process; that is, that this reform has been led by growers and supported by growers. A key feature of that is still not resolved, and that is because the growers' organisations are saying, firstly, major issues about taxation liability for their own funds that currently exist in the wheat industry fund have still not been resolved and, secondly, significant issues about ultimately listing the company on the Stock Exchange have still also not been resolved to their satisfaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So if, as the minister said in his second reading speech, this legislation is grower sponsored and grower supported, I have to say it is clear that that is not the case. Therefore, the government should have serious regard to the views of those organisations. We believe the government should be prepared to adjourn this legislation or defer it or even look at withdrawing it and bringing it back as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8634"> an entire package next year when it has resolved these issues. Therefore, I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like other senators, I, too, have been lobbied by one of the major farming groups concerned with the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R266">Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> &mdash;and I refer to the Western Australian Farmers Federation. The Western Australian Farmers Federation together with the New South Wales Farmers Association claim that those two states together count for approximately 75 per cent of Australia's wheat production. We all know that those two organisations do not represent every farmer in their two states and may not necessarily represent every member of their organisation. However, in these matters they are very serious players indeed and their views must be taken very seriously into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have said to me that there are two major unresolved issues from their point of view. One is the tax liabilities that wheat growers Australia wide may be exposed to have still not been clarified by the federal Treasurer (Mr Costello). I must say that, in respect of tax liabilities, they join with lots of members of the Australian community. They also say that listing on the Australian Stock 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Exchange, which is something the bill will facilitate, will be possible only if growers' control of the Australian Wheat Board is relinquished. This fundamental objective&mdash;that is, control&mdash;is the key to wheat growers' support for this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government has not yet addressed the tax issue and no suitable corporate structure has yet been developed that will suit the Australian Stock Exchange. They have asked that the bill be delayed until autumn 1998. Quite frankly, I would not know whether it is a reasonable proposition to delay until autumn 1998, but it does appear that there is a strong feeling from these major organisations that delays should occur and that, if possible, the two bills&mdash;this one and the one to follow&mdash;should be dealt with cognately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, particularly the coalition partner, the National Party, presumably are very close to the Western Australian Farmers Federation and the New South Wales Farmers Association, so I should think they are right on top of those issues. It will be interesting to hear how they view it. That is the first thing I must put on the table, as it were; that, as a Western Australian senator, a substantial constituency is suggesting that the time is not yet right for this bill to be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My second interest in the bill is to do with matters of accountability. Senators present would know that rural affairs is not my portfolio but accountability is. Individual farmers and groups of farmers over time, together with other constituencies at various times, have expressed to me the fear of dominance or capture by partisan or particular interests when governments have a hand in any kind of board, authority or organisation where people are appointed to manage it. That fear is regardless of which government is in power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My party, the Australian Democrats, are opposed to appointments based on mateship. We are opposed to a politically partisan appointment structure. I have previously brought to the Senate's attention the matter of the Nolan committee in the United Kingdom. Finally, even that class-rigid society got sick of the ministerial patronage that went on there and through the Nolan committee it recom 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8635"> mended a wholesale review and overhaul of the system of ministerial patronage and advanced a transparent, accountable and open appointment system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would have noted before you the circulation of amendments by me which address the matter of appointments of ordinary members to the wheat marketing board and set out the general principles whereby those persons should be appointed. Frankly, we should not have to do that in legislation, but the history of this country is no different to the history of any other country where people have the power to appoint others on either a nepotistic basis, the basis of mateship or the basis of conferring a benefit. Whatever happens, that is a partisan way to approach things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my belief and the belief of my party that it is in the interests of all Australians of any political colour to accept that a system where transparent appointment on principles of merit, independent scrutiny, probity, openness and transparency would be to the benefit of any organisation. I will be attending to that area of interest when the bill does come up for debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say in closing with regard to the second reading amendment moved by the Labor Party that, unless the government is able to indicate clear reasons why a delay should not be countenanced at this time, it is our inclination at this time to look upon such an amendment favourably. I would need to consult with my colleague Senator Woodley, who has carriage in these matters, but I must say the pressure, particularly from the two major industry groups involved, is such that the concerns need to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I have not picked up that anyone is necessarily opposed to the bill's intention, but they are opposed to proceeding with it until they get the answers they need. Accordingly, I reserve our position on the matter of the second reading amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose I, too, should explain why I am speaking on the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997. There are not too many bills of this nature that I have spoken on in the past. I suppose that in itself is an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> indication of the importance of this particular piece of legislation. Like my colleague Senator Forshaw, who spoke earlier, I am not speaking in opposition to the contents of the bill. In actual fact, we support the bill and the way it is structured. It is the timing that we have great difficulties with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole motivation behind what the bill seeks to do arises out of the work of previous governments, not just the previous government. The work was started by the former Minister for Primary Industry, John Kerin, and carried on by his successor, Simon Crean, and later Senator Bob Collins. So the coalition government's proposal is something that the Labor opposition agrees with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are we rising to our feet this evening to speak on this matter? The reason is simple: it is the timing of the legislation. We are, in part, echoing the words of the Chairman of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee&mdash;my Western Australian Liberal Party colleague, Senator Crane&mdash;who said this in a question during the hearings on the bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is against the law to put up half a prospectus; you have to put one up that is signed off by the Australian Stock Exchange.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What the government is seeking to do with this legislation is to put up half a prospectus. It is just not good enough. It is certainly not satisfying the industry, particularly those grain growers in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that Western Australia is Australia's largest wheat growing region. Over the five years to 1994-95, Western Australia accounted for an average of 42 per cent of the national output of wheat from this country. It is likely that, given the growth in value adding&mdash;mainly in the feedlot industry in the eastern states&mdash;and given an increase in the population of the eastern states, within 10 years only Western Australia and South Australia will be exporting any quantity of wheat. Already, Western Australia alone grows over 42 per cent of the national output of wheat, accounting for almost 70 per cent of Australia's wheat exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill imposes a regime on Western Australian growers, who distrust the contents of the bill. That is the reason why the West 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8636"> ern Australian Farmers Federation are writing to express their anxiety to senators of all political parties. When the bill was listed for debate on 29 October, the WAFF sent letters to all Labor Party, Australian Democrat and Independent senators asking for `a deferment of the bill until commitments given by government to this organisation'&mdash;that is, the Western Australian Farmers Federation&mdash;`and the grain industry as a whole are honoured'. Over a week has passed since that fax was received by every senator in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A similar facsimile message dated 9 November then came across today from Kevin McMenemy, the General President of the Western Australian Farmers Federation. I will only quote this letter in part because I will later seek leave to incorporate both letters. I have already passed them over to the government spokesperson. Mr McMenemy states in his letter of 9 November:</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lation. Having very recently been in Geraldton, I believe that, on this occasion, Mr Wilson Tuckey MP is expressing the views of at least part of his electorate on this particular bill. In his submission to the Senate committee that examined the bill, which is quoted at page 19 of the report, Mr Tuckey said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the existing legislation is premature and unnecessary, and we should be confronting the parliament with a single package that addresses all issues in one package. I find it ludicrous to suggest that we need this interim legislation so some people can go and get some practice in the commercial market. I think that this is just not true. The second fact is that I am deeply concerned for the future of the AWB and the whole marketing arrangements. I think they will fall in a great heap. I think if wheat growers want a guarantee that there is no single desk arrangement within 10 years, they will continue down the road they are going. I think they are going to get into awful strife, because their proposal is not commercial. Unless you take the Wheat Board out and make it a marketer and give it the freedom to invest in whatever it wishes over time, and give it a board of directors that have only one interest, that is, the shareholders, and the Australian Stock Exchange knows that, I don't think it will work.</PARA>

WAFF, as it is colloquially called, followed Mr Tuckey in giving evidence to the committee and its representative, Mr Moffet, said very publicly:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to say, having listened to Mr Tuckey, that the industry in the state does not support, and has not supported the general thrust of what is going on with the restructure of the Australian Wheat Board. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8638"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is repeated in the rest of the report, so I will not labour it further here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Western Australian growers are very disillusioned about what the government is seeking to do with the bill. They have no real understanding, and a great distrust, of what might be contained in the second bill when it is delivered to the parliament next year. They cannot understand why there is such a great rush to have half a pig in a poke at the moment. They cannot understand it at all, and no satisfactory explanation has been given to them to date to alleviate their grave concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is asking that the Senate vote on this bill which commits the national wheat industry to a course of action that the Senate cannot clearly define until such time as the second phase of legislation is finalised. So not only are the farmers of Western Australia and the growers throughout Australia being asked to buy a pig in a poke, but the Senate is also being asked to buy a pig in a poke by passing this particular piece of legislation at this time. Is that fair? I will listen with great interest to what the chair of the Senate Rural and Regional Legislation Committee, Senator Crane, who also&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I missed that one, Senator Conroy. But I will wait with great interest to hear what Senator Crane of the Western Australian Liberal Party has to say on this bill. Will he be in a position to explain what his government is seeking to do to the wheat growers of Western Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before we commit Western Australian and other Australian wheat growers to this radical change to a system which has served growers and the nation well since 1947, we ought to be able to properly address the issues which have caused Western Australian growers to be wary of the changes. For example, this bill facilitates the eventual listing of the corporate identity of the Australian Wheat Board on the Australian Stock Exchange.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What guarantee can we give to the wheat growers that their company will not fall into the hands of foreign competitors? Will any guarantees be given that that will not happen? Giant international grain trading companies, like Dreyfus or Cargills, have the means and the motive to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> purchase a controlling interest in the company. Will this bill allow them to do that? Will this bill prevent companies like that from undertaking such a course of action?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the company falls into the hands of institutional investors, be they foreign or domestic, to whom do its directors owe allegiance? Are they bound to direct their efforts towards the benefit of the wheat growers, or is it to be directed to the shareholders? At least the answer to that question is clear. Company law requires them to maximise the return to shareholders. To attempt to benefit wheat growers in isolation of shareholders would be a direct conflict of interest and an offence against the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wheat growers have been told that the memorandums and articles of the proposed new corporation will be so structured as to protect the interests of wheat growers in the event of such a conflict of interest. If that is so, has the Australian Stock Exchange given its approval to these memorandums and articles? If so, to what extent have they needed to be altered from those originally proposed and on which this proposition has been sold to wheat growers? Has this issue been the subject of the Senate committee's deliberation, and in what depth and detail did the committee deliberate upon it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Chapter 3 of the committee's report&mdash;and I commend my opposition colleagues on the quality of the report&mdash;deals with some of the issues that have been raised by wheat growers concerning the proposed corporate structure and it quite properly calls for these concerns to be taken into account. I differ from the committee's report where it recommends that we proceed to pass the bill unamended and then deal with these issues in the drafting of the second tranche bill. That is simply unacceptable. I am not surprised that wheat growers in Western Australia feel angry and let down by the coalition&mdash;by government senators&mdash;and the attitude that they have taken in rushing this legislation forward when neither they nor we have a clear picture of the consequences. I concur with my colleagues who were members of the committee and who insisted that further consideration of this bill be deferred until the whole package of legisla

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is probably about protecting some Collins Street farmers, but if their interests are sold off to form multinationals they will not be protected either. I want to deal very briefly with the wheat industry fund, which now holds some $550 million of growers' funds. Most of those funds would be the property of WA farmers. It is these funds which will be converted to equity stock in the proposed company and will form the basis of the company's initial capital in the form of the B&hyphen;class shares. Growers have contributed to the wheat industry fund on a compulsory levy basis since 1989 and each wheat industry fund unit has appreciated in value during that period. Had the WIF been used, as originally intended, as a capital base for the Australian Wheat Board to launch a self&hyphen;funded trading operation from, the capital growth would only have been assessable for capital gains tax if, for some reason, the grower realised his or her equity in the fund. The question that seems to be unanswered is whether, in the process of conversion from the WIF units to the AWB incorporated B&hyphen;class shares, a capital gains tax liability will be triggered. Again, that is part of the concerns that the Western Australian Farmers Federation have written to honourable senators about.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You laugh because none of you has ever dealt with the primary industry sector. When you try to deal with all the different sectors, including the Western Australians&mdash;the west against the rest&mdash;and even the Victorian Farmers Federation, it is very difficult to get them together. In fact, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8640"> this legislation is a major accomplishment; this is an industry agreed restructure. To that end the existing minister should be complimented and Senator Murray should put the puzzled look that he often carries around the chamber to one side. The industry supports this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to tackle the two previous speakers&mdash;and no doubt Senator O'Brien will advance the same argument&mdash;who spoke about the rewriting of history. Senator McKiernan said this all began with John Kerin, the then minister for primary industry. John Kerin wrecked more industries than he ever helped. The wool industry is just one example, let alone the wheat industry itself. The last restructure occurred back in 1989 and had our support in both chambers. It was in regard to the deregulation of the domestic wheat market and the monopoly the Australian Wheat Board had. But that was with our support. We are not getting your support tonight for the advancements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You then mentioned another primary industry minister, Simon Crean, as if he had something to do with today's legislation in any small way. He did not have a clue about primary industry, and I think he would concede that himself. What was he doing there? He had been shunted to one side because he was a danger to the then Prime Minister&mdash;that is why he was there. He did not have a clue and, what is more, he did not have any interest in the matter. As for Senator Bob Collins, he was part of it. He came in at the tail end of a decaying government and could not get anything done. He had bought his way into cabinet anyway; he had sold his soul, I think he told us once. Paul Keating wanted his soul, and he got it. Senator Collins went into cabinet as primary industry minister and he could not achieve anything because the government was already locked up by then. It is a case of absolutely rewriting history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Make no mistake about it: this is a major reform for the wheat industry. It is probably the most significant reform. It is no exaggeration to say that it is the most significant reform for the wheat industry since the very establishment of the Wheat Board in 1948 by the federal parliament. So Senator Forshaw 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should not come in here rewriting history. I believe that Senator O'Brien will advance the argument that they want to defer this legislation because they are not sure about the viability or future of the single desk selling policy. What an absolute red herring! They are just picking at this major reform for the sake of it. It is an absolute red herring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be a very serious matter if single desk selling were in any doubt. However, rest assured that it is in absolutely no doubt. The future is sound. I know we will not convince those on the opposite side about that, but all the industry can rest assured that single desk selling is safe. It is remaining with the Australian Wheat Board; that is a condition. The red herring that you are putting up to defer this legislation will not wash at all with the industry. It is a cornerstone of the industry policy in wheat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the wool industry, which faced fundamental changes to the floor price scheme, the sale of the wool stockpile and the future sale of marketing arrangements during a climate of severe downturn, if not despair, the wheat industry has the advantage right now, not a year or two down the track, of undertaking a major reform in a climate of good crops, particularly for 1996-97. That is not to ignore the past poor crops that have been foisted upon the growers over the years and which still have them paying back debts from the surpluses they have now gained. Nevertheless, good times do mean that we can take this opportunity to introduce and get support for our reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth highlighting to the Senate the importance of the wheat industry to the national economy, if not to the national social fabric, lest the parliament takes this legislation as just another amongst the dozens of bills that we are going to push through in the run&hyphen;up to the Christmas period. It is an export commodity that totalled $4 billion in 1996-97 and was No. 3 on our export lists. It is an industry that produces across Australia. As has been mentioned in a previous debate, Western Australia is the largest wheat growing region. It has accounted for an average of 42 per cent of national output. New South Wales is the next largest, with 24 per cent. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8641"> South Australia, Victoria and Queensland have 16, 12 and six per cent respectively.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WH4">Senator McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, I was provoked. I will now return to my script. I will return to the general principle of the legislation and exaggerate the point for the sake of clarity. The existing Wheat Board, a government underpinned body, is, in effect, being privatised. Though of late it has always acted as a corporate body, effectively and efficiently representing the wheat growers, it is now cutting the last 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> link with government in two stages. The second stage is to be legislated in late 1998. The government, in agreement with the industry, is removing in June 1999 the government guarantee to underwrite Wheat Board borrowings for the pool system. With the removal of the underwriting, a whole new structure for the Australian Wheat Board will be put in place. The restructure will see the Wheat Board move from a statutory marketing authority to a grower owned company from July 1999.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all these momentous changes, it is necessary to highlight that the bill provides for the Wheat Board to retain export control powers and to continue to manage the wheat industry fund, which will become the capital base for the post 1999 grower owned company. The wheat industry fund is being built up by means of a compulsory levy on wheat sales to be  terminated at 30 June 1999. In detail, it is worth referring to the minister's second reading speech to explain the new company structures for the Australian Wheat Board. I will quote from the minister's speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1 July 1999, wheat marketing will be undertaken not by the current statutory Australian Wheat Board but by a grower owned and controlled company operating under Corporations Law. The company will assume responsibility for all commercial aspects of the wheat marketing, including financing and operation of wheat pools.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new organisation will comprise a holding company with two subsidiaries: that is, a pooling subsidiary and a domestic trading subsidiary.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shares in the holding company will be issued in two classes: one A&hyphen;class share will be issued to each grower and the Wheat Industry Fund will be converted to B&hyphen;class shares. B&hyphen;class shares will be issued to Wheat Industry Fund equity holders on the basis of one share for every unit in the Wheat Industry Fund and will provide the company's capital base.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In conclusion I make two points. First of all, again to respond to the opposition's speakers on why the government is not pushing on with this bill, as I have said, we have industry support in this matter. But, if they like to refer to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee in regard to this bill, they will find that there are two reasons advanced in this report. The first 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8642"> is that it is a clear indication that reform is on track; that we are moving along the path of reform. The second is that the bill provides the Australian Wheat Board with the ability to move into the financial markets with the new structure properly underpinned by legislation in preparation. It is having this time to prepare for its move to a commercial structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth reinforcing that the export monopoly power of the Wheat Board stays; the tenet has been and still is fundamental to the success of the wheat industry and its ability to trade internationally, particularly given the fiercely competitive market that Australia is up against. So often we must compete against generously subsidised United States grain in our traditional markets and I cannot envisage the day that the Wheat Board's power to be a sole exporter will ever be lost. To that end I support the legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly tonight on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R266">Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , a significant bill for thousands of Australians involved in the production and sale of wheat. I would like to say that it is legislation that has industry support. It is a pleasure to follow my colleague Senator McGauran in his comments because he does have an extensive knowledge of wheat and wheat production. I know he is highly regarded in the Mallee and Wimmera districts of Victoria where he meets and speaks with wheat farmers and industry representatives. I also see in the chamber tonight my colleague Senator Heffernan, a wheat grower from Junee. Of course, the member of the executive who has the carriage of this bill is Senator Troeth, and she has a wide experience in wheat matters as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996&hyphen;97 Australian farmers produced over 20 million tonnes of wheat, which is about three per cent of the total world market, but we are a substantial world player because most of our wheat is exported because we do not have a large domestic population. According to the most recent Australian farm survey report, an estimated 14,500 Australian farmers grow wheat. It is a very widely grown crop and, along with the sheep industry, is very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> much the basis of the family farm. If you add those involved in improving wheat varieties, the selling, the marketing, the transporting and the exporting of wheat, it is clear that this legislation is important to many people in many country towns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill begins the structural transformation of the Australian Wheat Board from a statutory authority into a grower owned company, a process that began I guess in 1989 with the formation of the wheat industry fund. It follows the government's other major structural reforms in wool, and of course in the meat industries, which we will be debating before Christmas&mdash;very important legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is determined to provide the framework for primary industry and primary industry bodies. Industries are then allowed to get on with the job. I think that is probably the most effective way and the route that we are going to take in determining how our future industries are controlled. The coalition believes in letting primary producers take control of their own industries, in letting those with the most intimate product knowledge and expertise manage the marketing of their products. From July 1999 Australian wheat growers will be in charge of wheat marketing and this bill sets in process a chain of events by putting extensive transitional arrangements in place as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill allows for the separation of the regulatory and commercial activities currently undertaken by the Wheat Board and it allows commercial activities to be carried out within a corporate framework rather than a statutory one. As a result, most regulatory activities can be abolished in 1999 when the new company is established, except those relating to the all important&mdash;as Senator McGauran has said&mdash;export monopoly. It is a monopoly which is clearly in the public interest to preserve. If you look at the comments of those that observe the operation of the Australian Wheat Board around the world, they do not like our export monopoly. If they do not like it, it must be a good thing, and it must be in the interests of Australian farmers for it to be preserved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill enables the Wheat Board, with the minister's approval, to establish a wholly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8643"> owned company with two separate subsidiaries to carry out its commercial activities. The bill provides for the pooling of wheat to be undertaken by a subsidiary company and for other work, such as domestic trading of grains, to be undertaken by another subsidiary company. The holding company and subsidiaries will be established under Corporations Law allowing a clean separation of pooling activities from other commercial work. The government underwriting of borrowings to make advance payments to growers for pool wheat will continue until 1999, although these borrowings will now be undertaken by the holding company. These changes give the new company a chance to establish itself and a chance to develop a commercial track record as well as an identity in capital markets. They will smooth the transition to the new grower owned company in 1999 and will enable it to borrow in its own right for wheat marketing after 1999 at a favourable rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also provides transitional arrangements to enable the current board of the Australian Wheat Board to finish its term. It would alter the board structure and amend the selection process for the new board members in keeping with the new requirements. The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997, and the reform it gives effect to, is a good example of what can be achieved when grower groups and government cooperate. We both have the same goal, which is delivering the best possible outcome to growers. I believe this bill and the legislation that will follow in 1998 to complete the transition deliver the best outcome for wheat growers. They demonstrate this government's commitment to furthering Australian agriculture and supporting its future. The futures of those who work in it are in safe hands. I commend this bill to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(8.38 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in the debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R266">Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . It is the first tranche of the changes to the wheat marketing legislation which will occur this year and in the early part of next year. The question has been raised as to why we should continue with this legislation at this particular time and not wait until such time as we have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the whole restructuring of the wheat industry in one piece of legislation or in cognate legislation, as I think Senator Murray put it. The answer to that question is very simple and it is this: time is running out for the Wheat Board to restructure itself under a corporate arrangement to deal with the financial arrangements it needs to put in place prior to 1999.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do we require these changes for the Wheat Board? Why can they not continue and switch from one aspect to another? Once again, that answer is very simple. Some years ago the former Labor government made a decision to remove the government guarantee for funding of the Wheat Board. For people to say that the Wheat Board have had experience in handling these particular matters is very wrong. In fact, they have not. They have operated all these years under a government guarantee. As a wheat grower&mdash;and I should declare an interest in this; I think most people know my family partnership holds WIFs and we grow wheat&mdash;I have never quite understood that arrangement, but nonetheless it did happen. The current reforms which will end at the end of 1999 started back in 1989. That is when the WIF came into being. That is when processes were put in place to allow the wheat industry to become financially independent of the government. Some would argue that that was a good thing. I have always thought it was not necessary, but nonetheless it is going to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely crucial, for the future of the wheat industry and the establishment of the corporatised wheat board into an operating company, that in fact we see this legislation progress now. All of the other issues that have been raised in the debate here tonight and the other issues that were raised during our Senate inquiry have nothing whatsoever to do with this piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have publicly had things to say about tax liabilities. I firmly believe, and I will continue to argue with the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), that there should be no tax liability until such time as conversion occurs, and at that particular time it should start at zero. I think that is only fair and reasonable 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8644"> when you consider that back in 1989 the wheat industry made a decision to finance itself. I will continue to argue that that be the case. I believe that it is an argument that we will win because it is fair and equitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue is the listing on the ASX. I will have a bit to say about that in a while. Once again, they are issues that are not dealt with in this piece of legislation. The separation of powers between A and B is not dealt with in this legislation and nor is voting rights, which is one of the very contentious issues. I note Senator McKiernan's comments that he would be interested to see what I had to say on this legislation tonight. I am here and I hope he is listening. The separation of powers was one of the burning issues coming out of Western Australia. That has now been dealt with but, once again, it has nothing to do with this piece of legislation before us tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The memorandums of understanding for the grain industry, which are required up to 1999, have been negotiated and resolved within the working party. A timetable has been set for beyond 1999 for further MOUs, legislation or whatever is to occur at that time when it is fully corporatised. I will deal with some of these issues and refer, in particular, to our report on this legislation. Paragraph 1.4 of the report talks about the purpose of this legislation and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major provisions of the Bill provide for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the transfer of AWB's wheat marketing and financing functions to an AWB wholly owned holding company and its subsidiaries;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> for the AWB to retain control over export and marketing of wheat overseas;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the AWB to retain control of the Wheat Industry Fund (WIF) until the WIF component of the levy on wheat sales is terminated on 30 June 1990; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the AWB to be treated as the agent of nominated companies A and B in respect of new season wheat transactions (ie. what of the season that began on or after 1 July 1997).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The history is in paragraph 1.5. I do not have time to deal with all that tonight. I mentioned earlier that this started back in 1989. It is not something that was invented by this government. It is not even something that was invented by the previous government. It is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> something that came out of the grains industry itself. It is something, up to this point in time, on which there had been a bipartisan approach. All of a sudden the opportunists on the other side started going off on tangents and missing the point. Letters on this have been incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . I will not incorporate this letter but instead read it. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Crane,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997 due to be considered by the Senate later today, in light of correspondence received by you in the last few days suggesting the delay of the Bill, I thought it would be appropriate that I write to you to put the Grains Council of Australia's position on the passing of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I pointed out in the recent inquiry by the Senate Rural and Regional and Transport Legislation Committee on this subject it is highly desirable that the Bill proceed without delay through the Senate and I commend this action to you.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is another point of view that has come through the Grains Council. I think they gave very good evidence to the inquiry, particularly with regard to the ASX listing and the importance of the single desk. The President of the Grains Council made absolutely clear the position of the wheat industry&mdash;and, I have to say, it is one that I personally support very strongly&mdash;when he said that the single desk was absolutely paramount to the future of the Australian wheat industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look a little more at the history, because the thoughts of growers and their interpretations are very important. If you spoke to a wheat grower prior to 1989 and asked `What does the AWB mean to you?', they would have said, `Something like FAQ,' which is fair average quality. That has now moved to very refined quality control. One of the things that came out&mdash;I am speaking from memory on these figures so I may not have them exactly right&mdash;is that Australia had something like 46 segregations. The next best major country had, I think, 24. The US and Canada were around 24 or 22. In terms of developing that side of the industry, Australia has been at the forefront with the Wheat Board. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8645">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">FAQ then became GMP or the guaranteed minimum price. If you asked growers five or six years ago what the operations of the Australian Wheat Board meant to them, that is the first thing they would have said. Today it has moved to the single desk. During that 10 years, we have seen the deregulation of the domestic market and, as I mentioned earlier, the removal of the government guarantee as far as the wheat industry is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to make a point about the delaying of the bill. I had a long conversation tonight with Trevor Flugge, the Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board. I know that Mr Flugge has come under some criticism, as have other chairmen of the Australian Wheat Board during the years that I have been involved in the industry. I think Mr Flugge, Clinton Condon and the other chairmen of the Australian Wheat Board we have had over the years have done an incredibly good job. In fact, they have done a fantastic job. In the 1930s, when the Wheat Board was born, and during the Depression I can well remember my father saying to me, `Don't ever let them destroy the Australian Wheat Board.' Before we had the Wheat Board I can tell you that the price one week was 15 pence a bushel. A week later it was nine pence. Two days later it was six pence and three days later it was thruppence. That night, we all went out and slashed the wheat bags. The Australian Wheat Board was born out of what occurred at that time around Australia. It has performed a very important function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to re&hyphen;emphasise some of the things that Mr Flugge said to me tonight about the importance of establishing credit lines in their own right without a government guarantee behind them. There is a requirement of a minimum of 12 months to hedge in respect of the massive annual crop which we produce in this country and which we have to sell. We are one of the largest exporters of grain in the world. If this is left until the autumn of next year, time will have run out. Mr Flugge said to me tonight&mdash;and I asked whether I could repeat this in the Senate&mdash;that if this legislation is not passed tonight or in the next week or so, it could well mean that, come 1999, we are going to have to go to the government 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and say, `We have not got ourselves sufficiently established and it will be necessary for us to ask them to continue the government guarantee for another year or two.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wheat industry has been involved in this process for 10 years and there have been many beneficial changes during that time. The wheat industry must move to the next phase that was set out during that process. This legislation is a very important integral part of this. If we could have had all the legislation here before us tonight, I would have said, `Let's deal with it in one go.' But we have not got it here tonight. It will not be here this session because the grain industry has not come to a conclusion on a number of points. Also, the issue of taxation, which has not been resolved, is absolutely crucial to this legislation and, I believe, to the grain industry in terms of fairness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have put on the table a number of reasons why I believe the legislation should be dealt with tonight. I want to quickly touch on a couple of other points with regard to the grower corporate model. Let us see what was given to us in evidence. Mr Fisher of the Grains Council said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a little bit more advice than that, too, Senator. Technically, the advice you have received is that the Grains Council has not approached the Australian Stock Exchange to get approval for the grower corporate model. Technically, the information that you have received is correct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, Bankers Trust&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which is representing the Wheat Board&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have approached the Stock Exchange on two occasions with the grower corporate model. On both occasions, the Australian Stock Exchange said that they are not in a position to give us approval for our grower corporate model because this will not occur until after 1999. They are aware of dual&hyphen;class model structures around the world. They have asked Bankers Trust to provide additional detail to the Australian Stock Exchange on dual&hyphen;class models.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And so on. It is clear that the corporate model is a flexible moving operation. I could point to no greater dual&hyphen;class model than Wesfarmers, a West Australian company, in terms of how they have handled that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is provision for the way in which this grower corporate model could be handled. It 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8646"> will be worked through and done in such a way that there will be the maintaining of grower control between now and 1999 whilst at the same time giving the important benefit of having a corporate operation. While saying this, it is very, very important for growers&mdash;because we do have growers in this country, many of them in Western Australia, who have holdings now with funds in excess of $$200,000, even up to a $&frac14; million&mdash;to have a fair and equitable way to access that money, when required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I refer to some comments made by Mr Mortimer in answer to a question I asked of him during the proceedings. I will not read those comments out, but I asked, if this legislation were to go ahead tonight, whether or not, and if so how, it could or would impact and whether or not the Wheat Board could continue in the situation which exists without the second tranche. He said quite clearly that, in fact, it could; it is there for people to see. So, as far as this is concerned, the current arrangements for the corporatised Wheat Board could continue as they exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, I think we all are mature enough in this place to know that that will not be the case because, with the Australian grains industry having come to a situation where the previous government made a decision to remove the government guarantee, the position now is that we do need a fully commercial corporatised operating model. To enable the Wheat Board to place itself in position to be ready and able to carry out its task in 1999, I would urge the Senate very, very strongly to support this piece of legislation and allow it through the Senate as quickly as possible.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not pretend to have any expertise in the growing of grain, and here I would defer to Senator Crane. And most probably&mdash;I am not certain, but probably&mdash;Senator Troeth knows a lot more about growing wheat than I do. What I want to address is what is proper for this parliament to legislate, what is prudent for this parliament to legislate and what sort of scheme should arise from this legislation. That is the issue before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Crane has mentioned, a number of issues were dealt with when this matter was considered by the committee to which this bill was referred&mdash;issues which arise not from this particular bill but from the package of measures which is under discussion within the wheat industry. Included amongst those issues is the tax treatment of wheat industry fund moneys of farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that that be considered now, because part of the arrangement which this bill is predicating to put into place is a company structure which is intended to give some sort of tradeable value for the benefit of those wheat farmers who have money invested in wheat industry funds. Indeed, that is a critical issue for many farmers. They have moneys invested. They want access to those moneys. Senator Crane knows that they want access to those moneys. It has been an issue&mdash;and a crucial issue&mdash;in the discussions, in the reporting, in the evidence that the committee has received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that matter, the position of the Grains Council&mdash;and I have been heartened to hear Senator Crane's comments&mdash;was put by Mr Stewart, who gave evidence to the committee on its behalf. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the disappointments of the process up till now is that we have been waiting for some months for a draft ruling from the government on the taxation arrangements. It has certainly been one of the disappointments at this stage. We have continually progressed the issue with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Away from his office, I am not sure of the workings or the internal mechanisms of the government in that term, but he assures us that he is continuing to ask for that on a regular basis. We certainly want to see it as soon as possible. It is absolutely crucial to the growers and the growers support for the grower corporate model and the restructured organisation of the Grains Council.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was from one of the officers of the Grains Council giving evidence to the committee on this bill. The tax issue is absolutely crucial. Have we got an answer on the tax issue?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was contacted in my office this morning by an officer of the New South Wales Farmers Association. I subsequently spoke to an officer of the Grains Council about this matter, but the officer of the New South 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8647"> Wales Farmers Association was adamant that the issue of the treatment of the wheat industry fund moneys by the Treasury had been resolved&mdash;that is, at Treasury or ministerial level&mdash;and that the answer was not&mdash;I repeat, was not&mdash;satisfactory to the New South Wales Farmers Association. I also understand that that is the position which is taken by the Western Australian Farmers Federation; that is, that the response of the government, the minister&mdash;and I am not talking about Minister Anderson; I understand it is Minister Costello&mdash;on the question of the tax treatment of the wheat industry fund moneys is not satisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is an issue which representatives of the industry say is crucial to this package and it has not been satisfactorily resolved, then do we proceed with this bill which, I might say, abolishes the guarantee as of 1 July 1999&mdash;it is this bill that does it&mdash;and have a model which, in the absence of the rescission of this legislation, abolishes the guarantee and sets in train a process which will have a system of taxation treatment of the wheat industry fund moneys which is not acceptable to a significant part of the industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I received a fax from the New South Wales Farmers Association this morning. In that fax they say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Association initially supported the above Bill we had expected that the taxation position would have been resolved before the Bill went through the Senate. A final resolution on taxation will not be made this week.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I will come back to that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this stage our minimum requirements, which have been known since March, have still not been met.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I understand that there is an assurance that Minister Anderson will take the tax issue to cabinet. And he may well do that. There is no assurance as to what the outcome of cabinet's deliberations on that matter will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should the New South Wales Farmers Association in effect buy a pig in a poke in terms of the package which will be the outcome of this bill? That is what the government is asking the industry to do. On the question of taxation, there are, firstly, no guarantees that they will have a satisfactory 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> outcome and, secondly, there is a current position which is not satisfactory. The Grains Council said that the tax issue was crucial. I have quoted Mr Stewart on that. That is the evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So let us not as legislators put in place a part of a package which at its commencement appears to be unsatisfactory. It may be fair to say that the tax issue is not part of this bill; it is part of the package. And if we put part of the package in place, as is suggested, which includes the abolition of the guarantee on 1 January 1999 and a corporate model for the Australian Wheat Board, how do we go back without rescinding that legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us deal with the question of the Wheat Board. There was an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> a couple of weeks ago which talked about the restructuring of the Wheat Board in terms of its officers. New officers were appointed and some were effectively made redundant, because the Wheat Board is restructuring without this legislation in terms of its management structure. And the Wheat Board has a history of borrowing in relation to the operation of the single desk, the export of Australian grain. And that can continue&mdash;it has a history. True, it has a government guarantee at the moment. This bill will take it away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we step beyond that and we ask, `What else is necessary to give effect to the whole package? What else is necessary in terms of the second tranche of legislation and the other things which need to happen?' The critical questions include: what will happen to the monopoly which is to be provided under the legislation to the Australian Wheat Board operating as the single desk for the sale of export wheat; what provisions will be put in place; what sort of monopoly will it be; how will that monopoly report to the parliament which gives it the monopoly; what controls will there be? This parliament does not know. And we are being asked as law&hyphen;makers to put in place a structure which presumes a package of measures without our knowing what the next part of it will be. And one of the critical parts is an export monopoly. That is what we are being asked to effectively pre&hyphen;empt.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8648">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be true that we can have some sort of structure which operates without the second tranche of legislation and without the guarantee, but I have doubts as to how effective that organisation would be without the full support of parliament. Indeed, without the second tranche of legislation which gives it the monopoly on the export market, I do not know whether it would have any significant impact or be a real body for growers in this country. So we have to pass a second tranche of legislation to fulfil the whole package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does that mean that the government will then come to this Senate and say that we have to pass the second tranche of legislation or there will be a distorted body&mdash;which does not have a monopoly on the export of grain as is intended by the growers, which is proposed and supported by Senator Crane and which we support? I am not sure what we have. In other words, we are going to have the second tranche of legislation come to us, with a gun pointed at our heads, and we will be told, `Pass it or we have nothing.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are we in this position? The problem is that we have, firstly, a desire by the growers that the new company should be controlled by growers and, secondly, we have a desire by the government and the growers to attend to the question of how they recover moneys from the wheat industry fund. So we have a proposed company which will have A and B class shares, and the A class shares will be owned by grain growers. There has been some argument about how the shares will be distributed but that has been resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have B class shares which are to represent wheat industry fund moneys and which are intended to be traded from 1 July 1999 and thereby allow growers to recoup their wheat industry fund moneys. To do that, it is intended that the company will be registered on the Australian Stock Exchange. Today I was told that there was a question as to whether the Stock Exchange as a requirement of listing would require that the single desk be sunsetted. That is a view which was put to us by the New South Wales Farmers Association. We would like some clarity about that matter&mdash;indeed, so would the New South Wales Farmers Association. They may or may 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not be right in relation to that matter, but it is a matter of concern and one which should be clarified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is of greater concern is the issue of how the Stock Exchange will permit the selling of B class shares when it is intended that the A class shareholders will elect directors who have a majority and therefore control the company in the interests of the growers. So the Stock Exchange has to accept that those shares which are able to be sold&mdash;that is, the B class shares&mdash;may not ever be sold in such numbers as will exercise a control of the company. There is an argument, which has been put to us by a number of witnesses, that that will not be permitted by the Stock Exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An argument was put forward also that those bodies that buy B class shares will insist that the company is run as equally in their interests as it is in the interests of those who hold A class shares&mdash;the growers. That is a matter of conflict which may end up being resolved in the courts. No solid satisfactory evidence was put before the committee which resolves that issue. It is not surprising that bodies such as the New South Wales Farmers Association and the Western Australian Farmers Federation, to name just two, have been in contact with the opposition to ask that this legislation not be passed at this stage until the tax issue has been resolved, until there is clarity about the structure of the company, until there is certainty that the structure will be accepted by the Stock Exchange and until there is no question about what will happen to the single desk in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prudence should indicate that those matters ought to be resolved. We are talking about a significant industry; an industry that gives Australia over $5 billion in export income. In other words, it makes a significant contribution to the national economy. Do they deserve a package of measures which is not before the parliament in one lot? Do they deserve a measure which gives them part of the story but does not resolve critical issues which their representative bodies have raised? Mr Fisher, a representative of the Grains Council, gave evidence to the Senate inquiry. In talking of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8649"> the advice they had received from Bankers Trust, Mr Fisher said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They believe that the grower corporate model will be able to list on the Australian Stock Exchange, but they are not prepared to give us a decision at this time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is, the Stock Exchange is not prepared.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, technically, the information received is correct, but we are very confident and the independent financial and legal advisers are very confident that it will list; otherwise there is not much point the industry pursuing this model.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the critical phrase: if you cannot be sure, there is no point in pursuing this model. That is what the representative of the Grains Council said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is this government pursuing this model with such determination at a time when it cannot resolve the concerns of many grain growers? Lest it be said, for example, that the Western Australian Farmers Federation is not representative, they were the only body which came to the committee and said, `This is how we have reported to our members on what we have done. We have had meetings of members. We have had 1,450 growers support our stand and one member vote against it.' That is the evidence that they gave the committee. It is on page 67 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. That is the position taken by a direct growing representative body&mdash;the Western Australian Farmers Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, the Grains Council is a peak body. It does not have direct contact with the growers; it has contact through other organisations. It is trying to do the best that it can in the circumstances, but if the best that it can do leads us to a situation of uncertainty then perhaps we should think carefully before we act on this matter. In terms of the department's view, Mr Mortimer gave this evidence, which is on page 142 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing fundamentally changes in terms of the Wheat Board's operations as a result of the first tranche of legislation in terms of how it relates to the external world outside the four walls of the Wheat Board, if you like to call it that. The export monopoly will continue to be provided and indeed operate in exactly the same way.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A statement like that is a two&hyphen;edged argument. On the one hand, Mr Mortimer was suggesting that if we make the change noth 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing will really change; we will go on as we are. On the other hand, if we go on as we are until we get the second tranche of the legislation, why can't we do that equally as well? The only argument that we have had is that somehow it will affect the borrowing and hedging ability of the Wheat Board because they have to prepare themselves for the withdrawal of government guarantee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that all parties have, as I understand it, expressed in principle support for the package subject to seeing the whole package and, as good legislators should, passing it in the knowledge not of what they expect to happen but what will be the clear package, why can't we wait and put that in place? No detriment to the Wheat Board will arise from not passing this legislation&mdash;none at all. If there is any suggestion by the Wheat Board that this is the case, frankly that flies in the face of the evidence they presented to the committee, the evidence of the department and the evidence of the Grains Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the Grains Council position on whether we should be dealing with this legislation in two tranches or one, they clearly said in evidence before the committee that their preferred position was that we should deal with both tranches together as one package. That is the opposition's position. We think that this matter ought be adjourned until we get both packages. The opposition will be moving an amendment to the motion for the second reading to that effect. In any case, we should wait until cabinet has resolved the matter that Minister Anderson intends to take to it on the advice that we have received.</PARA>

The federal government's behaviour towards child care has been in line with two philosophies: firstly, that the funding of social infrastructure should be reduced and, secondly, that women should be encouraged to stay at home and care for their children there. The effect of this approach has been $820 million worth of cuts to child care over the last two budgets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister must be a very frightened man at this time. He must be very concerned that the present change to child care will result in the community reacting in much the same way as the aged population has by revolting against the changes in aged care. He really has very good reason to be worried because at the last election the government promised:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . ensure that all parents have fair and equitable access to affordable, flexible and high quality child care options regardless of whether they choose to participate in the paid work force or to care for their children at home.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">By anybody's standards, this promise has now been broken. The annual report of the Department of Health and Family Services acknowledged:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parents are paying up to $780 a year more for child care because Federal Government relief has not kept pace with costs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government are condemned through their own annual report. Families on incomes only just over $27,000 are paying $15 more per week than they did in 1994, which is not a long time ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last two budgets, the federal government has brought massive changes to child care. In the 1996 budget, the Howard government abolished block grants to vacation care; froze the child-care assistance ceiling for two years, meaning that any increase in child care has directly flowed on to parents; removed the $30 amount per dependent child disregarded amount when assessing the family income, thereby artificially decreasing parents' entitlements to child-care assistance by inflating their income; capped non-work related care at 20 hours per week per child; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> capped work related care at 50 hours per week per child; reduced the child-care cash rebate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent; and abolished operational subsidies for community based long day care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Child Care Payments Bill  introduces changes to the hours of care, and the coalition's 1997 budget measures for child care propose another round of significant cuts, which certainly will reduce the way child-care centres operate and will reduce the assistance and rebate available for parents. The child&hyphen;care payments legislation will continue the process of fee increases, the use of unlicensed care, the closure of centres and the reduction of women's ability to work. The government has failed to acknowledge the widespread community concern about its changes to child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government members of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, when they examined the bill, restricted consultation by working to unrealistic guidelines. In fact, they did not allow many organisations which had expressed a wish to appear at the hearing to come forward and express those views and, in particular, not one group of parents was heard by the committee. In my view, that is a very significant oversight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last fortnight of parliament, we have also seen a rather extraordinary move by the government to prevent an inquiry into the changes in child care by refusing to agree to a child-care reference being given to the Community Affairs References Committee. That is a quite extraordinary breach of normal Senate practice when the committee itself had decided to pursue that reference. The minister has instead insisted on proceeding with this bill despite the fact that 28 pieces of subordinate legislation, which are essential to determine how this bill is to take effect, were not made available to the opposition or other interested parties until last Thursday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Child Care Payments Bill  introduces a number of measures, including immunisation, as the criteria for child-care assistance and the child-care rebate. It also legislates a 20-hour limit for non-work related care and a 50-hour limit for work related care. These measurers were, in fact, announced in the previous 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8651"> budget. The minister will allocate child-care hours to regions in a manner which is not yet specified and will limit places to 7,000 in both 1998 and 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition overwhelmingly supports national immunisation objectives. We support this objective to encourage immunisation, and we recognise that many child-care centres already require children to be immunised. We do have some concern that the criterion of immunisation for child-care assistance and child-care rebate access may, in fact, mean that many families who are worst off and have trouble steering themselves through those requirements for the application will miss out and will not be able to access child care. We have also recognised that in the past there have been temporary shortages of antigen and vaccines. In fact, we will be moving in the committee stage to incorporate an amendment that allows people to access child-care assistance and the rebate despite the fact that they have not yet been able to vaccinate their children because of these temporary shortages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Child Care Payments Bill  also puts in place a number of planning provisions, including the limitation of hours used and places available, the regional allocation of hours and approval practices for centres accessing child-care assistance or the child-care rebate. We are supportive of these planning provisions which will ensure that the demand and the supply of child-care places are more closely matched, but there is great uncertainty about the method by which this will be done and there is no indication that mechanisms are being put in place which will, in fact, ensure that this occurs. It has not been communicated to the opposition whether there will be particular provision for children aged under two and whether there will be particular provision for areas that need extended periods of care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the bill is implemented, the structure will be in place for the government to limit child-care places long after the two-year period. With the mechanisms put in place through this bill the government may be able to, without further reference to parliament, remove places that presently exist. This 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> worries me and it certainly worries a lot of centres and a lot of parents and children who utilise these services. There is no guarantee in this bill that existing services will receive approval to continue and that they will have the same number of places available to them. It is a further concern that nothing contained in this bill actually provides for work based child care&mdash;a service that many parents would very much like to access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will allocate hours to regions, but has not specified what those regions are, how it will decide which regions will get what hours or what provisions will be made to increase hours in places when demand has not been met. The bill has no recourse to parliament on the minister's determination for regional allocation of hours. This again is a matter of great concern. The government's decision to limit care to 50 hours per week will also disadvantage women who live in regional and fringe metropolitan areas, women who have to travel long distances to work. In many cases they require much more care than the 50 hours specified in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have concern about the harsh changes made to emergency child care. The government has said that a child can be at risk for a period of only four weeks in a 12-month period&mdash;a position that we find quite unreasonable. Again, we will be seeking to amend that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the meanest cut implied as part of this legislation is the abolition of the operational subsidy to outside school hours care. The  Child Care Payments Bill 1997  threatens the operation of outside school hours care by removal of this operational subsidy, just as the previous budget's abolition of operational subsidy for community based long day care centres threatened their viability. This change will have a greater effect on the before and after school care than the previous cuts had in relation to community based day care centres. Many centres will close without this subsidy. Small centres and those in rural and regional areas are most at risk. In many cases, services will have to be closed or the number of qualified staff will have to be reduced.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8652">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has not seen fit to recognise that the removal of this operational subsidy will mean that in many cases costs for a child will increase by an additional $14.50 per week. This increase will be paid in most cases by parents. The government has made much of the fact that it is increasing access to child-care assistance, but in many cases the increased cost brought about by the removal of the operational subsidy will not be offset by the increases in child-care assistance. So a lot of the benefits derived by parents will be taken away by the other hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is only a matter of time in my view before this government also removes the operational subsidy for family day care. As we know, in the 1996 budget the government indicated it would be abolished, but with community outrage it was reinstated. I believe this is only a temporary setback to the plans of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also of great concern to me that there has been so little consultation between this government and the child-care centres, the industry generally and, most particularly, parents. I know there have been seminars held in relation to the legislation before its finalisation. But certainly, since this subordinate legislation was finalised and distributed, not only has the child-care industry had little by way of consultation; it has had only since last Thursday to even comment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of areas are of major concern to the industry, such as the future removal of existing child-care places, the lack of provision for baby places and extended hours care, the reductions in the period defined as `session of care' and the potential removal of direct payments to child-care centres of child-care assistance. As you may recall, it was initially announced in the 1997 budget that all payments in future would be made directly to parents. But again this was an indication that was not borne out by this legislation. I am unclear at this stage whether the government intends to continue with this objective. It may well be that, in the next budget, this change will be brought about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implementation of these bills is largely by way of subordinate legislation, as I have already stated. These pieces of subordinate 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legislation will tell us how this bill is affected. I do not believe we have had sufficient time to tell what the real impact is. The big changes that are occurring are in fee increases. The 1996 budget cut of $500 million included the abolition of the operational subsidy in the community sector. You may remember that NACBCS did a survey that said that fees had gone up $18 per week. As I said, this has been found by the department itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The government claims that the payment of child-care assistance to centres will make up for operational subsidies but, as I said, it will not be enough to ensure that parents do not pay more. NOSHSA, which is a group that represents before and after school care, has estimated that the administration time in one centre would quadruple because of the implementation of this bill, which would be equal to $169.20 in administrative costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fee increases were also confirmed by the survey on child care carried out by the New South Wales Council of Social Service, which found that 80 per cent of parents complained of fee increases of up to $25 per week. There will also be a reduction in the amount of fees to be paid to parents for family day care from the current $3.05 per hour down to $2.30 per hour. This may well mean that the parents of a child in an average week of care will be paying an additional $40 per week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real concerns are with the closure of child&hyphen;care centres and also with the decline in the quality of care. In many centres, we have already seen a reduction in qualified carers and the removal of extra services such as hot meals and nappy services. Parents are being asked to assist by fundraising or by doing cleaning and gardening. The hours of care have also been reduced in many cases. This means that, while the parents are paying more for child care, the care being provided to children is not at the high standard it was when this government was first elected just under two years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> When we talk about child care, quality is obviously a priority. But if those centres are no longer available and if parents cannot afford access to the centres, then I suppose the issue of priority becomes a moot point. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8653"> There is a very strong indication that many parents are taking their children out of child care because of the increased cost. When they take their children out of child care, they then put them into backyard care, which is not controlled and which is not accredited. This means that, in some cases, those children may be at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very sad day for the Australian community when this government feels that the dollar is more important than the care and safety of our children. But, very clearly, that is exactly the purpose of this bill: the government is saying that the budget bottom line is more important than how our children are cared for. I believe that this government should be very careful. While many parents who will be affected by this legislation are not fully aware of these child&hyphen;care changes, they will be. When those parents do become aware of these changes, they will certainly make their voices heard very strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is not helping the battlers; this government is not helping families; this government is slowly eroding the social infrastructure that families rely on. The families of Australia will express their anger at the next opportunity they have because of one thing that is occurring, and that is this government is taking away their child care.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Child Care Payments Bill 1997 and the Child Care Payments (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1997 make four basic changes to child care. They introduce a new rate of child-care assistance for school aged care, place a 20-hour per week limit on child-care assistance for non-work-related care, introduce a long overdue planning system for private long day care places, place a limit on the number of new private sector child&hyphen;care places eligible for child-care assistance available in 1998 and 1999, and introduce immunisation criteria for eligibility for child-care assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats will be supporting most of the measures contained in these bills today, although I must say that the date which was originally proposed for the commencement of some of these measures has been a major cause of concern among parents 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and child&hyphen;care providers over the past couple of months. Based on our discussions with parents and child&hyphen;care providers over this period, it was soon obvious to us that the government had failed to recognise the difficulties which would have been caused by the proposed 1 January 1998 start-up date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concern over this start-up date was one of the main reasons the Democrats suggested that these two bills be referred to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. We are pleased to see that, as a result of this committee hearing, the government has now decided to delay the introduction of these reforms until 27 April 1998. This is a positive outcome for all concerned. I am pleased to see that the committee hearing, which was set up at the Democrats' suggestion, provided such an effective forum for parents and child-care services to make their concerns known to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Before addressing any of the measures contained in these bills, I just want to take a moment to put on the record the fact that the Democrats have been very critical of the way this government has handled the whole area of child care. The government needs to be strongly condemned for a number of the changes that have already been introduced, and the effect that these changes have had on many families. In particular, the government needs to be condemned for the effect that many of these changes have had on the ability of parents&mdash;and especially of women&mdash;to choose how best to combine their work and family commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make it perfectly clear that the Democrats think that a lot of damage has been done to child care in this country as a result of cuts which were made in last year's budget. Some centres have been forced to close and a number of other centres are predicted to close within the next few months. No-one can afford to ignore the damage which has been done to those parents who have been forced to give up work or to give up study because they can no longer afford to have their children cared for. It is shameful to think that a government which so strongly speaks of its deeply held commitment to families can, at the same time, come up with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8654"> policies which hurt the very families it claims to represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Democrats have fought hard to prevent many of the changes which were announced in last year's budget from coming into effect. With other parties in the opposition, we voted against the abolition of operational subsidies for community based long day care centres, the capping of child-care assistance at 50 hours per week per child, the abolition of the additional income allowed for additional dependent children when assessing a family's eligibility for child-care assistance and freezing of child-care assistance and the child&hyphen;care cash rebate for two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, our vote, with that of Labor and the Greens, was not enough to prevent these changes from coming into effect, with these regressive reforms&mdash;although I do not know that you can have such a thing as a `regressive reform'&mdash;passing in the Senate with the support of Senator Harradine and Senator Colston.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe that policies such as those introduced in last year's budget work against families, and we will continue to take whatever steps are needed to protect the interests of families. What we will not do, however, is to take the hypocritical kind of approach we have seen the opposition take in the area of child care and in a number of other portfolios&mdash;most notably and most recently in respect of the government's aged care reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see nothing positive in using unjustified scare tactics to make a political point. We do not take the kind of blanket condemnation approach we have all too often seen the opposition take.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As centres in areas such as these depend on a large proportion of non&hyphen;work related care, the Democrats urge the government to consider implementing some kind of strategy to minimise the short&hyphen;term effect on these services. In the longer term, we hope that the long overdue planning proposal we are considering today will prevent this kind of oversupply occurring in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is good to see that there is an acknowledgment that we cannot allow wholesale unplanned expansion of child&hyphen;care places in any suburb that a developer picks. While we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8655"> will monitor how the 7,000 places are distributed, and watch carefully to ensure that no rural or regional area suffers from this decision, we congratulate the government for moving towards a more responsible approach to future child&hyphen;care development. We believe that the previous government did not do enough on the need for planning, and it is good to see that finally the urgent need for this measure has been recognised and acted upon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some child&hyphen;care providers have also expressed concern about the heavy reliance on ministerial discretion through the use of disallowable instruments contained in these bills. While the Democrats accept that the use of disallowable instruments is not unusual and is, indeed, a fairly standard procedure, we urge the government to ensure that the industry is given the opportunity to comment on the 27 disallowable instruments which are part of these reforms. We reserve the right to move to disallow any of these which we believe will work against the best interests of families and the quality and affordability of child&hyphen;care services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One aspect of these reforms which greatly concerns me, and which I believe needs to be changed&mdash;and I think others agree with me&mdash;is the provision of harsh penalties of imprisonment where a person has been convicted of fraud, making untrue statements, making false representation, or obtaining a benefit under false pretences in respect of child&hyphen;care payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Democrats have been comforted to some extent that the bill prevents a person being imprisoned for receiving a child&hyphen;care payment simply through an act of failure or omission, we do not believe that using prison penalties to punish offences relating to child&hyphen;care payments is either appropriate or desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me pay tribute to a former senator in this place who spoke often about these sorts of penalties&mdash;I refer to Western Australian Greens senator Christabel Chamarette, who lectured us on many occasions about this. Her words certainly got through to me. I signal our intention&mdash;and perhaps other senators and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parties in this place have the same intention&mdash;to move amendments at this point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also must express my deep regret at the government's decision to withdraw operational subsidies for out of school hours care. However, because the withdrawal of operational subsidies for out of school hours care is not something which is subject to legislation, I can only call on the minister to closely monitor and reconsider if necessary the effect this decision has on the viability of these important services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect of these reforms which the Democrats would like to see closely monitored is the reduction in the hourly rebatable fee from $2.30 to $1.95 per hour for out of school hours care in long day care centres. While we understand the desirability of standardising the rebatable fee for all out of school hours services, and we applaud the government for greatly increasing the income level cut&hyphen;off for this subsidy, we do not believe that any increase in the out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket expenses for families using long day care centres can be justified.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition's horror budgets have radically changed the child-care sector in this country for the worst. They have moved funds out of the community based sector by slashing the operational and capital assistance provided to non-profit service providers and shifted the balance to greater reliance on private providers of child&hyphen;care services. Make no mistake: this has been an ideological move based on undermining the community and driving women out of the work force and back into the kitchen. The main rationale for the withdrawal of the community based centre operational subsidy was that it would:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real reason behind the government's attack is that it slashes $110 million from the child&hyphen;care budget, and it did not seem to care very much for the adverse impacts on working women, which are now becoming very apparent. This year we have seen work force participation rates for women suffer their biggest falls since the 1970s. While this may not all be due to the impact of the child&hyphen;care changes, they are undoubtedly a major influence. Feedback from community and industry groups reinforces our view that these changes are in fact leading to women being forced out of their jobs simply because they cannot afford child care. That is a situation for which this government should be deeply ashamed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Figures from a comprehensive study undertaken by the National Association of Community Based Children's Services indicate that these government cuts have caused substantial increases in child&hyphen;care costs&mdash;in fact, double the usual annual increases. The figures show that 73 per cent of parents exiting care showed increased fees as the reason and that 67 per cent of those leaving are using informal care. The trend towards `backyard care' is a major concern and the social impact of the government forcing what could be second-rate child care on working women could have social impacts that this society will be paying for dearly in the long run. Many centres have been forced to adopt measures which seriously undermine service quality, with more than 25 per cent of centres in each state or territory having reduced staffing levels in an attempt to keep fees down. The biggest cuts to staffing have been in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community owned child&hyphen;care sector has been ravaged by this government. In 1991 child&hyphen;care centres owned by the community provided 56 per cent of places; in December 1996 this was down to 27 per cent. The government has completely removed operational subsidies for community based centres and placed in jeopardy a system of high quality, affordable child care in Australia. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Adequate funding to support the model of community ownership should be a basic tenet of any socially responsible government, which is probably why we have seen this government do its best to destroy the community owned model for the provision of child care. Community owned long day care centres have taken the lead in establishing the benchmarks for high quality care. This government's policies place those standards of quality in severe danger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of care is ultimately tied with the use of care. Accordingly, for many parents the rising cost of child care has meant either a complete withdrawal or a reduction in the hours of care utilised by their children in centre based care. The problem is particularly acute in Western Australia where, as I mentioned, the study showed that on average 12 families per centre left formal child care in 1997. Some centres reported over 50 families leaving and 40 families cutting back their hours. This is adversely affecting the very people in our society this government should be targeting for assistance: the women struggling to get a toehold in a work force which is increasingly competitive and in which industry is still failing to pull its weight with regard to child&hyphen;care provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be increasing child care, not reducing it. Governments have an obligation to support parents in their efforts to care for their children. We are also getting evidence that women in the work force with individual workplace contracts are getting the worst end of the stick in wages and conditions. I imagine that would add to the situation of many working women having to withdraw from both work and/or child care. What this government should be doing is listening to the professional, community based child carers in our communities in the same way as it listens to the coal, oil and mining industries. It should consider, firstly, increasing the child&hyphen;care assistance ceiling for centre based care to better reflect the actual cost of care; secondly, reinstating the $350 million taken from the children's services program in the budget and redirecting it into assisting affordability; and, thirdly, supporting community owned children's services by providing financial 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8657"> assistance to voluntary committees of management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's other recent progressive changes have included the limiting of child&hyphen;care assistance to 50 hours per week per child. Again, this was purely brought in to slash $30 million from the child&hyphen;care budget in 1997&hyphen;98 and approximately $33 million in 1998&hyphen;99. Another area of concern is the cessation of indexation for the next two years with regard to the child&hyphen;care assistance fee ceiling and child&hyphen;care cash rebate ceilings.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak tonight about an issue of crucial importance to the upcoming ballot for the Constitutional Convention. It is, of course, imperative for all Australians, but especially those young Australians who may be voting for the first time, to take the opportunity to cast their ballot in determining the remaining 72 delegates to the convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise this issue not only because the issue of constitutional change is one that I have long been concerned with but also because the broader issue of voting is very important for a nation which draws strength from its democratic structures. I want to reiterate the importance of the ballot for the Constitutional Convention not only because it is for the election of delegates to the body that will have the biggest single impact on the future of an Australian republic but particularly because it will be the first occasion on which many young Australians will have the opportunity to vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This experience of voting for the first time is something many of us may have taken for granted even if at this stage we remember it. But, in the context of the voluntary ballot for the convention, I believe it is very important to encourage all young people to exercise their vote now. They should particularly be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> encouraged to cast their vote in view of the track record of young voters in other nations where voting is conducted on a voluntary basis. In looking at the record where voluntary voting is the norm, the trends of voting amongst younger people are concerning. In the United States, the voter turnout for elections is often very low, particularly in younger age brackets. Figures for the most recent congressional and presidential elections indicate that as few as 16&half; per cent of enrolled voters between the age of 18 and 20 actually took the time to vote. Certainly the impact of a higher profile presidential campaign results in greater numbers of young people voting, but this trend serves only to highlight the point I wish to make tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only by raising the profile of the ballot for the convention and of the convention itself will we ensure that anywhere near the numbers of young people who currently are able to cast their votes in Australia cast their vote in this, a voluntary ballot. The only way to do that is to constantly remind not only ourselves but the nation of how critically important this process is. It is this process, an educative one, that I wish to stress this evening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regardless of whether young people wish to support a republic or support the current system, it is still critical to vote, and we need to remind them of this. In particular, it is worth while noting the contributions of some who are doing their utmost to spread the word about the Constitutional Convention. It is particularly worth while to mention the contributions of the youth movements of the major political parties in Australia. Branches and divisions of the Young Liberals, the Young Democrats and Young Labor have all passed motions in support of the republic. In joining these organisations and in discussing issues such as the republic, these young Australians have demonstrated their commitment to participating in the electoral and democratic processes by which Australia is governed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is most pleasing about these expressions is the indication it gives that many young Australians are actively considering the future of their nation and the way they want this future to progress. Certainly my own 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8658"> division, the New South Wales Young Liberal Movement, has maintained constant consideration on issues such as the republic and those related to it. I see Senator O'Chee kindly acknowledging the participation of the organisation in that regard. It is leading the way not only for the New South Wales Liberal Party as a whole but for the party across the country. Their active debate and discussion does much to help educate all Australians about the issues surrounding the republic&mdash;issues at the heart of the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also pleased to see that the Australian Youth Forum, held recently in Canberra during the session break, discussed not only the issue of the republic but also the broader topic of Australia's future. I would like to briefly revisit these papers of the Youth Forum to point out one of the many valuable recommendations that came from the conference. It was `to educate all Australians, particularly the young, about the issues surrounding an Australian republic'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This recommendation of the forum strikes at the heart of what I am saying this evening. Education and awareness, both during the balloting process and afterwards, are the key to the Constitutional Convention not only representing all Australians but producing an outcome that all Australians can feel comfortable with. One of the most effective ways to encourage young people to vote is having young people with whom they can identify running as candidates for election for the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud of the fact that the Australian Republican Movement, with which I have been involved for a number of years, has an excellent field of young people on its tickets across the country. In New South Wales, the ticket boasts five young Australians committed to an open dialogue on the republic and related issues. These talented young people come from a range of different backgrounds, political persuasions and regions of New South Wales. I want to recognise the diversity and talent of these individual candidates and acknowledge their commitment to the process of Australia becoming a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gladys Berejiklian, a former President of the New South Wales Young Liberal Move 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment, leads the young people on the ticket. She is highly involved with the Armenian community in Australia and has served her community in many capacities, including on the Armenian National Committee of Australia. Her commitment to the importance of the political process as a senior office bearer of a young political organisation is longstanding. By participating in this ballot, she continues that commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further demonstration of the broad diversity of appeal for the move to a republic is the candidacy of Stephen Crowe running on the ARM ticket. Stephen, who I am sure is well known to my Hunter based colleague Senator Tierney, is a member of the victorious ARL Newcastle Knights football team and is also a committed republican. He works with the well-known John's Boys to take the message to the people of the Hunter. Rose Kelly, currently a student at the University of Technology in Sydney, hails from the mid&hyphen;north coast of New South Wales and, at 18, has a substantial background in community and civic issues. As one of eight young people in attendance at the Bathurst people's convention last year, her experience in constitutional matters is already strong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The candidacy of Jason Falinski, the current national President of the Young Liberal Movement and member of the ARM ticket in New South Wales, demonstrates the high level of support amongst the Young Liberals and, indeed, many in the Liberal Party for a move to a republic. Fifthly, Rania Wannous, at 22 years of age, is a long-time resident of Sydney's south-west and represents an Australian Lebanese background. Rania, who works for the Sydney based think&hyphen;tank the Evatt Foundation, is also on the Australian Republican Movement ticket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be remiss of me not to mention that other tickets campaigning for election to the convention also have talented and accomplished young candidates standing. These people are running on a variety of tickets, including both pro&hyphen;republic and pro&hyphen;monarchy tickets. All are extremely committed to their individual beliefs. The crucial issue for all of us, though, should be that young people take the time to vote. In my state of New South 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8659"> Wales alone, there are 1.2 million people between the ages of 18 and 30. For many of them, the vote for the Constitutional Convention will be the first time that they have had an opportunity to vote. It is critical that they not only understand what it is they have the opportunity to do but understand the responsibility they have to help determine the future shape of our country&mdash;a shape they will live with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this is not a compulsory ballot, it is fundamental that all Australians exercise their right to vote. For young Australians, the opportunity to have a direct impact on the constitutional make&hyphen;up of our country is invaluable. Not since the conventions prior to Federation have Australians had this opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a republican of long standing, it strikes me as passing strange that those who have long derided and condemned supporters of the republic for discussing and debating different issues and propositions for constitutional change this very day find themselves in turmoil while some of their number venture closer to the ground of progress and change. Former Governor-General Bill Hayden suggests that only a referendum can effect the change of name from Governor&hyphen;General to head of state. Lloyd Waddy, of the Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, immediately opposed any change to any part of the constitution today. Abandoned by their strongest advocates, who now also move to support change, the Australians for Constitutional Monarchy are in complete disarray and face their words coming back at them from the other direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I encourage all Australians to exercise their right to vote in the upcoming ballot for the Constitutional Convention. In particular, I encourage all young Australians to take the time to learn about the convention, to learn about the people running on different tickets and to learn about what it will mean for Australia to become a republic. The right to vote is the fundamental principle of any participatory democracy. It is critical that all of us, especially those who will maintain our democratic tradition in the future, especially 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> young Australians, make an informed decision and cast their vote in this election.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8659"><TITLE>Cox Peninsula Transmitter: Radio Australia</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on the adjournment debate tonight to address the Howard government's ham&hyphen;fisted closure of the Radio Australia transmitting station on Darwin's Cox Peninsula and the equally ham&hyphen;fisted performance by the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) in trying to fill the void. As honourable senators would be aware, the decision by this government to cut funding to Radio Australia and its Asian services in the last budget has left the Cox Peninsula transmitter station silent&mdash;a government decision that is directly against the national interests of this country. The station is a $40 million facility. In its last three years in office, the former Labor government spent more than $12 million upgrading the facility. I personally opened the broadcasting of the new transmitters. I might add that that money was spent in precisely the same way as the BBC World Service spent its money, for example, when it recently upgraded its short&hyphen;wave facilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could be forgiven for wondering why, given the enormous sums of money that have been put into the facility and the universal acclaim for Radio Australia's output from the transmitters, any government would seek to silence the service. However, the fact is that the decision was taken in the budget by this government at the very time that Pauline Hanson was wreaking havoc in our relations with Asia. Of course, it was news today that it has recently been assessed that the impact of that kind of propaganda in Asia has cost us $100 million a year alone in the export of our educational services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston announced in a press release issued on 13 May that the facility would be mothballed from 1 July and the National Transmission Agency would explore possible future use of the Cox Peninsula transmitters. Nothing more was heard from the minister until the Senate estimates round in June when my colleague Senator Schacht took the issue 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8660"> up with him. The minister informed the Senate at the estimates hearing on 11 June that the government was proceeding as planned: the National Transmission Agency would mothball Cox Peninsula from 1 July. The government, Minister Alston hastily added, was `very much interested in exploring both buy and lease arrangements' for the facility `with interested parties'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Transmission Agency informed the Senate that it had received a number of approaches from commercial and national broadcasters to use the facility. These included the BBC World Service and Radio Free Asia. Radio Free Asia is an American broadcaster, but quite distinct from the Voice of America. Radio Free Asia is in fact funded by the Congress&mdash;and very handsomely, I might add&mdash;on the same basis as Radio Free Europe was established during the Second World War. Senator Alston told the hearing that he did not consider there would be any objection to an overseas broadcaster using the facility. The Senate was also advised that Radio Free Asia had offered a `substantial amount' for the use of the facility. Senator Alston told us that he would be taking expert advice as to what guidelines would be put in place for the future use of the facility, presumably by a foreign broadcaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He saw nothing strange in the fact that overseas broadcasters were vigorously pursuing the use of an Australian facility that his Australian government had rendered redundant. He saw nothing strange in the fact that the facility was to be mothballed but that he had not moved to establish any guidelines. He presumably saw nothing strange in an American voice beaming out a huge `Good morning, Vietnam!' or `Good morning, Beijing!' from Darwin, replacing 50 years of factual, even&hyphen;handed and highly respected broadcasting into the region from Radio Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Needless to say it soon became evident that the minister did not have a clue whom the National Transmission Agency was even dealing with, and the possible diplomatic repercussions. In answer to a question without notice less than a week later, the minister told the Senate that he recalled having a discussion with Radio Australia's General Manager, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Derek White, in his office several weeks before about the interest of overseas broadcasters in using Cox Peninsula. Senator Alston was so disinterested in the closure of this Australian facility that he could not even remember the name of the American broadcaster that was actually the frontrunner&mdash;as we now know&mdash;to take it over. The minister thought it was `the Voice of Free America'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nothing more was heard publicly until the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> carried a report on Monday of last week headlined `Cabinet in a jam over US radio bid'. The story said that the Howard government was caught in a diplomatic squeeze between Washington and Beijing over a push by Radio Free Asia&mdash;or the Voice of Free America, as Minister Alston would have it&mdash;to broadcast into China from Cox Peninsula. According to the report, Australian intelligence agencies have predicted that Beijing would try to jam any Chinese language transmissions by Radio Free Asia from the facility. One of the attractions that was reported for Radio Free Asia was that the power of the transmitters at Cox Peninsula can apparently overcome attempts at jamming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beijing and Hanoi have both recently condemned Radio Free Asia broadcasts. The official <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">China Daily</EMPHASIS> newspaper warned recently against the `dangerous ambitions of the United States to create trouble and instability in regional countries by using Radio Free Asia'. Foreign Affairs Minister Downer pointed out to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> that Senator Alston would have the responsibility for technical and commercial decisions in relation to Cox Peninsula but that he would examine the foreign affairs implications. `We are certainly not in a game of provocatively damaging our relations with China,' he told the newspaper. I assume he has since passed the message on to his hapless minister for communications, but many questions remain. The most obvious, in terms of the national interests of our country, is why this decision was taken in the first place. There has never been an adequate explanation provided on the matter by this government, especially by the relevant minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Has Senator Alston developed guidelines&mdash;the ones he talked about? If so, why has he 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8661"> not released them? If no guidelines have been developed by the minister, I believe the Australian public at this point in time has a right to ask: why not? Why had there been no communication between Senator Alston and Minister Downer on this sensitive issue before the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> report appeared last week? It is not as though this issue simply crept up and bit the government. The Howard government's plans to effectively silence Radio Australia and close down Cox Peninsula have been the subject of considerable debate both within and outside this parliament. I wonder if the minister could extract his feet from his mouth long enough during the current session to tell us what is going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The burning question of course is a simple one: what is the present status of negotiations between this government and Radio Free Asia, or indeed the BBC World Service or any other broadcaster, for the use of Cox Peninsula? Cox Peninsula is a world&hyphen;class short&hyphen;wave facility. The world's major broadcasters are well aware of its value and are literally queuing up in the hope of leasing transmission time on our transmitters for their access, on behalf of presumably the British government and the American government, into the Asian region&mdash;a region we continually say we are anxious to have better access to and relations with. Meantime, while we have an Australian government negotiating with the American Voice of Free Asia service, we have silenced our own Australian voice into the region. It beggars explanation.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8661"><TITLE>Public Housing: Victorian Auditor-General</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise again tonight to draw the Senate's attention to the essential role of the Office of the Auditor&hyphen;General, and in particular to draw attention to the work of the Victorian Auditor&hyphen;General in the management of public housing by the state Department of Human Services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recently published Auditor&hyphen;General's report included an analysis of the Victorian government's management of housing assets. That report, entitled<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Public housing: Responding to a fundamental community need</EMPHASIS>, demon 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> strated that the public housing sector in Victoria is not nearly as robust as the government would have us believe. It showed that on 30 June 1996 there were 61,700 households on the public housing waiting list&mdash;an increase, the report said, of 79 per cent over the last 10 years. It said that around 61 per cent of these households, or 37,600 households, have been on waiting lists for longer than two years with almost half waiting for periods in excess of four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also indicated that, despite the obvious trends toward a need for more public housing, the level of funding made available to the Department of Human Services for housing assistance by the Commonwealth has declined by 14 per cent in real terms since 1991&hyphen;92. The Auditor&hyphen;General's report indicated that the Department of Human Services was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . taking a range of actions to address major shortcomings in past asset management.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">By that they mean housing management. For example, the report referred to the accumulated backlog of maintenance and upgrading of properties at a cost of around $148 million, the difficulties experienced in providing justification required for redevelopment projects in country areas of the state and the practice of holding vacant land parcels unused for periods of up to 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the report obviously highlights the inherent weaknesses in past and present management of public housing assets, it also credited the Victorian government with at least examining some of the facts presented and formulating plans to address some of the deficiencies. The Auditor-General's housing report is a concise document which outlines the public housing situation in Victoria without attempting to lay particular blame. It is an independent assessment of a public problem. According to the Victorian Office of the Auditor&hyphen;General, and I quote from the report itself:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report was well received by the Department of Human Services which generally accepted the audit findings and agreed to consider audit recommendations as part of its public housing strategies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One would assume from that that the Department of Human Services would use the audit 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8662"> findings to develop its plan of action, but Victoria is a state with a government which cannot handle criticism of any kind. It is a state where the needs of the less advantaged are rarely considered. This is a state government which is obsessed with boosting the needs of big business and which regards as a threat any research which points to deficiencies in its services. It appears to be a government which will take any action to silence its critics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At about the same time that the Premier first announced his intention to drastically reduce the scrutinising powers of the Auditor&hyphen;General, he also announced a major restructure of the management of housing for people on low incomes in Victoria. As part of the new housing plan, responsibility for crisis accommodation would be centralised and offered up for tender by private contractors. Sweeping changes would be made to tenancy laws in the state which would render security in public housing pretty well a thing of the past. People on waiting lists for public housing would be subjected to an even stricter set of eligibility criteria. Most significantly, funding for many of the most active and, need I say, vocally critical housing advocacy groups in Victoria would be slashed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two events may not be directly related, but I think they are further evidence of the state government's campaign to silence any group which would dare to speak out about government policy or action, whether it be community groups, housing advocacy groups or the Office of the Auditor-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A week or so ago, the Victorian state government announced its long awaited plan for the future role of the Auditor&hyphen;General. As of July next year, all public sector and financial audits are to be contracted out. The present Office of the Auditor-General will be disbanded and the majority of the 151 staff members will move to the new audit body&mdash;Audit Victoria. Audit Victoria will compete with private accountancy firms for the audit work of government departments and statutory bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest that this decision spells disaster for any semblance of government accountability in Victoria. Our independent 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Auditor-General has, to all intents and purposes, become redundant. I suggest that the federal government ought to be very concerned about this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the inherent contradictions within state government departments in the management of the public housing stock is that those who manage the stock are also landlords and it is their responsibility to act on any deficiencies. If the department is seriously concerned about addressing the shortfalls in public housing management, then it really needs to have a critical look at its own policies and priorities in allocating and managing funds. Rather than take this more mature approach, however, the state prefers instead to nobble the Auditor&hyphen;General and bury the problem of housing management by contracting it out. In other words, shoot the messenger and sweep the problem under the carpet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state government claims that the real source of the current crisis in public housing is lack of support by the federal government of course. While the Commonwealth government continues to drag its feet in making any firm commitment to public housing in Australia, the state governments&mdash;and I include all state governments&mdash;can always find a convenient excuse to push through their own agendas of change and reform and the buck passing goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is our view that the federal government should be concerned about the developments in Victoria and the implications for the future role of auditors&hyphen;general in all other states. In September this year we did warn the government that this would happen and the Democrats proposed amendments to the  States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill  which would have ensured the continuing independence of the state auditors-general in auditing state government use of Commonwealth funds. But the government and the opposition voted together to have these amendments defeated in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I give notice, however, that, whenever a states grants bill comes before the Senate again, the Democrats will again seek support from both major parties to ensure that the independence of state auditors&hyphen;general are maintained and, hopefully, strengthened. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8663"> Hopefully, both the government and the ALP will eventually have the sense to vote in favour of our amendments and protect the taxpayers' money from that lack of accountability which will occur if we do not ensure that auditors&hyphen;general are independent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The auditor-general is the only formal body left which can provide an honest and impartial analysis of how government resources are allocated and managed in each state. He or she is not obligated by political or social allegiances to say the right things to the right people. It is a truly unique position of being able to tell the truth. We need the auditor-general to be independent so he or she can expose the problems to tell the public, to tell the governments and oppositions and minor parties such as ourselves what is really going on in this country.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8663"><TITLE>Air Vision Pty Ltd</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, let me draw the attention of honourable senators to Mobil's offer of $450,000 which was made to Air Vision Pty Ltd. Mobil made this offer after the recommendation of the conciliator was suspended on the production of further evidence. In other words, when it became obvious to Mobil that there was further damning evidence against them, then and only then did they make an offer in line with the conciliator's original recommendation. But at that point the conciliator was already looking at further evidence which, in his own letter which I have tabled in this place, he suggested could have substantially increased the amount of the recommendation which he would have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of record that the conciliator could not make that recommendation. Why? Because Mobil withdrew themselves from the Oilcode process. They did so to frustrate the Boundys and to frustrate their attempt to get justice. One can only but note with dismay the fact that the Boundys were forced to produce information such as diary records and so on at a late stage because they were of the belief that Mobil was going to play fair, that they were going to play the game. They were playing a game, of course, but it was not the game that the Boundys thought they were playing. In fact, it was a game where the rules were written by Mobil for Mobil. Mobil showed a high disdain for the rights of my constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that Mobil say that they did not suggest to the Boundys that they would take over the operations at Sydney airport. Mobil in fact say, `Well we did not have the oil contract at Sydney airport.' That is, in fact, correct. They did not. But Mobil said to the Boundys that this was a matter of great confidentially. Mobil said to the Boundys, `We believe it is a good thing if you purchase a flat close to Sydney airport, but do not put it in your name and do not put it in the name of the company because this is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8664"> key to the confidentiality of what we are proposing to do at Sydney airport.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You see, Mobil wanted the Boundys to be their pawns, wanted them to do their work, and then when Mobil changed their mind, they used that secrecy argument to say, `Look, we never had any operation there.' Of course they did not, but they were planning to have an operation there. The Boundys were used by Mobil as pawns in their plan and then cruelly dumped when it was not of interest or of benefit to Mobil to use them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is further evidence of Mobil's intentions in this regard. This relates to a mission statement which was made about the time that Air Vision entered into an enterprise bargaining agreement at Mobil's insistence. That mission statement made reference to expanding the operations of Air Vision and Mobil to other airports, most notably Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that Mobil take the view that they have fulfilled their obligations. In particular, a key part of Mobil's argument is that they have fulfilled their obligations because the Oilcode process was complete. Let me make this very clear: the Oilcode process was not complete. The Oilcode process could only be complete when either a compromise was reached or a recommendation was rejected or accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not one of these three possible outcomes occurred. There was no compromise because Mobil never intended to have a compromise. A recommendation was made, but it was neither accepted nor rejected by Air Vision for the simple reason that, at the time at which that offer lapsed, Air Vision had asked for further conciliation so that the conciliator could give consideration to the further information that they had made available&mdash;in particular, the diary notes. In fact, if the Oil Code process was complete, why did the conciliator say in his letter&mdash;a letter which I have tabled in this place&mdash;that Mobil withdrew from the Oil Code process; that Mobil in fact prevented him from making a further recommendation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was no agreement, there was no compromise; no offer was accepted and no offer was rejected. Air Vision were entirely within their rights to ask that full consider 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ation be given to all of the evidence to support their case. Quite clearly the people who are in the wrong here are Mobil, because they withdrew from the process when the process did not suit them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a letter dated 16 October, Mobil have said to me that they acted at all times within the letter and spirit of existing and proposed legislation, so there can be no change in their position. If that is the case, then I challenge Mobil. I say to them: go back, comply with the requests of the conciliator and allow the Oil Code to reach a conclusion. Allow the conciliator to further consider the evidence before him and make a revised recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know what that recommendation will be. I have my strong suspicions that it will not be to Mobil's liking. But, if they are truly interested in the Oil Code process, they will go back to the conciliator and say, `Right, we will comply with your requests and we will then see what recommendation you have to make.' At that point the ball will not be in Mobil's court; the obligation to complete this process will lie with Air Vision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do Mobil have to lose? If Mobil have played within the spirit and letter of this process, Mobil have nothing to lose. If they have dealt with my constituents fairly and honourably and decently, Mobil have nothing to lose. If Mobil are right and my constituents are wrong, Mobil have nothing to lose and nothing to fear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if any one of those premises is not true, if Mobil have not played fairly, if Mobil have not treated my constituents honestly and fairly and decently, then Mobil will prove that by their unwillingness to go back to the conciliator and see this process to a fair and just conclusion. Mobil will stand condemned by their inaction if they fail to do the honourable thing.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="10.26 p.m." PAGE="8664"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 10.26 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator Kemp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) and (2) The Government re&hyphen;affirmed Australia's continuing support for an MAI at the May 1997 OECD Ministerial Council Meeting. The Government endorses the objectives of an MAI and looks forward to the development of a MAI providing a strong and comprehensive framework for international investment, thus enhancing the role international capital flows play in contributing to improving economic well&hyphen;being.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much of the detail of the proposed treaty remains to be negotiated. It is important to note that the MAI will provide scope for country positions to be covered by reservations. Australia's approach to the MAI negotiations is to seek to ensure that Australia can maintain its current policy stance in relation to the coverage of the MAI, including foreign investment policy. Any international treaty that Australia joins also needs to take account of the limitations imposed by Australia's Commonwealth/State arrangements as provided for under the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3), (4), (5) and (8) Australia supports the development of internationally accepted core labour standards. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) is the appropriate forum for pursuing such matters, a view shared by many other OECD countries. The Government will continue to work multilaterally through the ILO and the United Nations to encourage adherence to and observance of core labour standards. The Government does not see value in including matters relating to the development and enforcement of labour standards in international instruments governing the conduct  of trade and investment activities, including the MAI.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the MAI and environmental protection, the Government's view is that the MAI must be consistent with the basic principle of the need for investment liberalisation to be mutually supportive of environment protection in order to promote ecologically sustainable development. The MAI has the potential to promote international ecologically sustainable development through the transfer of technology and environmental management expertise and more efficient international allocation of resources. The negotiations are at an early stage on this issue and a consultation process with non governmental organisations regarding the MAI has been put in place by the OECD. Australia supports suitable non&hyphen;mandatory provisions in the MAI on codes of practice in the environment protection 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> area. It is important that the MAI not prevent signatories from continuing to work together in other forums to promote environmental, or other important public policy interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The scope of the MAI in relation to the basic issue of extra&hyphen;territorial action is yet to be determined. The Government is continuing to monitor developments on this important issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) A convention aimed at criminalising the bribery of foreign public officials is being negotiated in the OECD, separate to the MAI negotiations. The intention at this stage is for the convention to be open for signature by the end of 1997. The precise text of the convention is still being negotiated and, once it is finalised, the Government will give serious consideration to acceding to it.</PARA>

Fulfilment of this development condition does not relieve foreign interests from having to comply with State and local government requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government approved the parties' involvement in the Earl Hill project in July 1995. The parties were advised that there were no objections to the proposal under the Government's foreign investment policy, subject to the parties commencing development by 31 July 1996. However, the time limit for commencing development may be extended in instances where the parties experience delays in obtaining the relevant State and local government approvals for the project, which has occurred in relation to this proposal. The Government's approval of this project was also subject to environ mental conditions.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) On 8 September, 1972, a De Havilland DH82A aircraft registered VH-AQL, disappeared whilst on a private travel flight from Cambridge, Tasmania, to Flinders IsLand, in Bass Strait. No trace has been found of the aircraft or its occupants.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) The pilot, Maxwell Henry Price, aged 58, held a valid commercial pilot licence which was endorsed for the aircraft type His recorded flying experience was 1, 968 hours of which 962 hours had been gained on DH82 type aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) The only passenger was Brenda Mary Hean and she occupied the rear cockpit.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv) The pilot was the holder of the Certificate of Registration for the aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(v) The Certificate cf Airworthiness for the aircraft was valid until 9 November, 1975. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(vi) There is no evidence to suggest that the gross weight of the aircraft or its centre of gravity were not within safe limits.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(vii) The aircraft was fitted with an auxiliary fuel tank and approval had been obtained for the installation of a smoke generating system for use in sky writing operations. The owner/pilot, however, had integrated these two installations in a way which was not approved and would not have been approved by the Department on safety grounds. Thus, during this fight and arising from this situation there were potential hazards such as of undetected fuel loss or of fire in flight but there is no evidence that these or any other hazardous flight situations which could be related to this installation actually occurred or contributed to the disappearance of the aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(viii) The pilot submitted a night plan to the Hobart Flight Service Unit for a Right expected to commence at 1030 hours from Cambridge to Yarram, Victoria, with an intermediate landing at Flinders Island aerodrome. The plan Indicated that the night would be made in accordance with the Visual Flight Rules at altitudes below 5000 feet and that the pilot did not intend to report his progress by radio en route. The estimated time interval to Flinders Island was 160 minutes and the aircraft s total endurance was shown as 250 minutes. The plan indicated that the pilot would report to Flinders Island Flight Service Unit before 1400 hours EST.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ix) There is no record of the pilot having requested or received a meteorological forecast before departure. The current area forecast indicated that the weather on the planned route would be suitable for the flight, and a post-flight analysis of reports and observations made in the area confirmed that the weather was substantially as forecast. There is nothing to indicate that weather was a factor in the disappearance of the aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(x) The night plan Indicated that the aircraft would carry life-jackets, first aid equipment and a VHF (Very High Frequency) survival beacon There is evidence that the VHF survival beacon was not carried on the flight and that the life-Jackets were not worn by the occupants but were stowed behind the rear seat.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(xl) The aircraft departed Cambridge at 1016 hours and, one minute later, the pilot made an on-course radio report to Hobart Control Tower. No further transmissions were heard from the aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(xii) At 1400 hours, when the pilot had not reported his arrival at Flinders Island, the Flight Service Officer on duty at the aerodrome commenced checking possible alternative landing places in the area. These checks failed to estab 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8681"> lish the whereabouts of the aircraft and search and rescue procedures were initiated at 1430 hours.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(xiii) An intense air, sea and land search was conducted over a period of twenty days and the search was continued on a reduced scale for a further twenty-nine days During this whole period a total of 374 hours 36 minutes were flown by search aircraft and 105 sighting or hearing reports were evaluated. The weight of the evidence indicates that the aircraft proceeded in a northerly direction along the east coast of Tasmania to Eddystone Point where it headed seaward in the direction of Cape Barren and Flinders Islands. The last reported sighting, by a witness at Eddystone Point, indicates that the aircraft was then flying at an altitude of about 2,000 feet and appeared to be operating normally.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(xiv) It was the normal practice of the pilot, when carrying fuel in the aircraft s auxiliary tank, to conduct the take-off with the main tank selected and then change to the auxiliary tank when established in cruise flight. He would then run the auxiliary tank completely dry, allowing the fuel supply to the engine to be interrupted, before re-selecting the main tank. Calculations based on the aircraft s estimated fuel consumption and probable en-route wind velocities suggest that, had the pilot followed his usual procedure on this flight, the auxiliary tank would have become exhausted in the Banks Strait area, between Eddystone Point and Cape Barren Island,</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Minister for Defence met with the PNG Minister for Defence, the Hon Mao Zeming MP, on 22 October 1997 to discuss the bilateral defence relationship and sign a Joint Statement on the New Defence Partnership. The key principles of the New Defence Partnership, as outlined in the Joint Statement, are mutual interest, openness and transparency, mutual respect, achievable goals, and support for democratic and constitutional processes. Under the New Defence Partnership the primary joint activities will focus on strategic planning, management, and fundamental military skills, including leadership and discipline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) There are no current plans to increase arms transfers to PNG. Any proposal to export lethal goods to PNG would be subject to normal defence export controls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) As part of the Short Term Package announced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs during his visit to PNG in August, 1500 sets of field uniforms and personal equipment are being provided to the PNG Defence Force. Generally, however, the focus of activities under the New Defence Partnership is on strengthening the human element of the PNG defence organisation, particularly through training and development of personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) Under the New Defence Partnership, Australia is prepared to offer increased levels of training for the PNG defence organisation. The training offered will focus on priorities of strategic plan 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8684"> ning, management and fundamental military skills, including leadership and discipline. These priorities have been mutually agreed between Australia and PNG.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) In line with the New Defence Partnership, exercises involving the PNG and Australian Defence Forces may increase. Exercises are important activities which play a key role in developing mutual understanding, exchanging skills, and promoting interoperability between participating defence forces. Any increase in exercise activity would be subject to agreement with PNG.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) No. The Australian Government's position on the engagement of Sandline mercenaries has been made abundantly clear on many occasions. The Australian Government was greatly concerned to learn that the previous Papua New Guinea government intended to use mercenaries on Bougainville. The Australian Government's position is that any attempt to use mercenaries to impose a military solution would only have worsened the situation on Bougainville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) (5) and (6) The Government does not accept the implication that it needs to choose between a defence relationship with PNG and support for the Bougainville peace process. A stable and secure PNG remains of fundamental importance to Australia and we will not walk away from the relationship. We will continue to seek to develop the professionalism, discipline, and basic military and leadership skills of the PNGDF, through training and personnel assistance provided as part of the New Defence Partnership. This approach is consistent with our strategic interests, and with the Government's continuing support of efforts to encourage a peaceful resolution of the Bougainville conflict and minimise the potential for human rights violations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government believes that a negotiated settlement is required to secure a lasting peace on Bougainville. In this context, the Government welcomes recent positive developments in the Bougainville peace process through the Burnham talks in New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major outcome of the Burnham II talks was the Burnham Truce, a document which has been signed by the Commander PNG Defence Force, as well as BRA/BIG leaders. While a final settlement remains subject to further dialogue between the parties involved, the resumption of dialogue and announcement of the truce are positive developments in the Bougainville peace process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Defence Force played a key role in facilitating the Burnham II talks by providing transport for Bougainvillean delegates.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8685"> ing answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes. I have received several representations from NNAAMI.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2&mdash;6) Yes. As the proposal focused on service delivery which is the responsibility of the State and Territory governments, it was forwarded to all State and Territory directors of mental health on 15 January 1997 for their consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3&mdash;5) NNAAMI is not specifically represented on current bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many organisations representing components of the mental health sector. It is not possible for them all to be represented on national mental health bodies. Where appropriate, NNAAMI has been invited to express its views on issues affecting its constituency such as at the Workshop on Children's and Young People's Mental Health held in Melbourne in April 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) No. As an alternative to funding a number of organisations representing small segments of the mental health sector, the Government is involved in a process to establish a single national peak body for mental health which is representative of the whole mental health sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) Funding under the National Mental Health Strategy is generally not allocated for ongoing service provision such as that planned to be undertaken by NNAAMI. During the consultations for the development of the Second National Mental Health Plan, children of parents with a mental illness were identified as a specific group warranting attention. National funding for specific projects will be determined following consideration of the Second Plan by health ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) I am aware that this group is one of those at higher risk of developing mental health and related problems. It is for this reason that children of parents with a mental illness have been identified for particular attention under the Second National Mental Health Plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) I am aware that the research literature suggests a slightly higher than average risk of suicide for children with at least one parent with a mental illness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(12) The $31 million funding allocated to the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy (NYSPS) is already committed on projects, many of which encompass suicide prevention services which people with a mentally ill parent could access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(13) The Second National Mental Health Plan will be released following consideration by Commonwealth and State Health Ministers in November 1997. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
