The government believes that the functions of the Department of Administrative Services can be better conducted under the authority of the Department of Finance. We think we can achieve the administrative load that was its task in the past in a more efficient way and deliver the responsibilities of government more effectively.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill. Minister, you would be aware that illegal fishing has been a problem in Australia's Antarctic waters, particularly around the remote Heard and McDonald islands. What action has the government taken to protect Australia's sovereignty in these areas?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="7693" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has been aware of a number of fishing vessels allegedly operating illegally in Australia's Southern Ocean territory around Heard and McDonald islands. Madam President, you would be aware that other illegals have been caught in recent times, particularly by France in its territories. I understand that there have been similar experiences in the territories of the United Kingdom, New Zealand and South Africa. You will appreciate the potential consequence of this to the unique environmental assets of the region. This is a very logistically difficult region, being so far from any land. Nevertheless, the assets of the region are unique and require protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to say that the Howard government has in fact taken decisive action 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7694"> to protect our Southern Ocean interests. At the government's direction, the Australian Defence Force has successfully apprehended two foreign fishing vessels allegedly operating illegally in Australia's exclusive economic zone surrounding the Heard and McDonald islands. It has been, as I indicated, a major undertaking of the ADF. Heard and McDonald islands are 4,000 kilometres from Perth, located in one of the wildest and most remote parts of the globe. The frigate HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anzac</EMPHASIS> was deployed during the operation. I understand that the two apprehended vessels are registered in Belize and Panama. They are returning with HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anzac</EMPHASIS> to Fremantle and should arrive towards the end of this month. It is possible that the masters of both vessels can be charged under the Fisheries Management Act. The penalty for illegal foreign fishing can include fines of up to $250,000 and forfeiture of the vessel's gear and catch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to protecting Australia's sovereignty by stopping illegal fishing, it is, as I indicated, vitally important to protect the environmental values of the region. Without enforcement action in the Heard and McDonald islands EEZ, illegal fishing could effectively destroy the region's commercial fish stocks, including the Patagonian toothfish. This would, of course, have major consequences on the region's ecosystems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly want to commend the Minister for Defence, Mr McLachlan; Senator Parer, who is responsible for fisheries; and Senator Ian Macdonald, who took a lead in arguing the case for the government to expend these resources to protect our natural environment. It demonstrates the determination of this government to protect our environmental assets, even when the cost of doing so is very expensive. It demonstrates the determination of our government to comply with the CCAMLAR regulations and to ensure that exploiting natural assets such as fishing is done in an environmentally responsible way. We will not tolerate abuses that put such environmental assets at risk.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If ever there was an area of stark contrast between the government and the opposition it has to be in the area of funding for the arts. I am sure members of the community vividly recall the grotesqueries of the Keating regime when Mr Keating was promoting schemes which involved the provision of hundreds of thousands of dollars to artists who were not in need of any financial assistance, were not required to be accountable and, in many instances, simply had to be well known to the leader. We have not seen any disownment of that approach by the Labor Party. We all look forward to the release of their draft platform in the next few weeks when, perhaps, we will get a glimmer of an insight into whether they have any notion of what funding for the arts is all about. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7695">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has already announced a $3 million emerging artists program which will be of tremendous benefit to artists who are struggling&mdash;and there are very many of them. It will assist artists in regional communities, particularly those who require exhibition spaces, those who want to exhibit their works in other areas, those who want to undertake mentorship schemes, those who want studio access, and those who want to participate in concert series. We will be developing our first release CD scheme. There will be a whole series of initiatives to assist emerging artists in areas such as theatre creativity, visual and craft artistry, the mentorship scheme, the emerging music artists concert series scheme, the emerging Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists initiative, the emerging choreographers initiative, and the new media emerging artists initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week I announced grants totalling $3.8 million for touring programs for Visions of Australia, Playing Australia and Festivals Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Schacht, I commiserate with you on missing out on the deputy leadership of your party. It was not a big challenge but, unfortunately, you were not quite up to it. We now have Mr McMullan with a whole raft of responsibilities with arts tagged on. Of course, we have heard nothing from him yet on these schemes, let alone any repudiation of the `Keatings'. Prior to that, we had Carmen Lawrence who hardly said boo on the subject. In today's Newspoll I noticed, in passing, that Simon Crean ranks on the same level as Carmen Lawrence in terms of popularity. He happens to be one point behind that other category of `someone else'. So that tells you how well the opposition are going. There certainly is no&hyphen;one who is showing the slightest interest in the area of the arts, and I think the arts community are entitled to unde 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rstand that they were well and truly duped and hoodwinked for very many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been giving particular emphasis to regional arts, and our regional arts fund will be of particular benefit to people outside the metropolitan areas. We have also announced recently a $24 million funding package from the Australia Council, $12 million of which has been committed to providing triennial funding to 26 outstanding arts organisations for the first time. There is a great deal happening in the arts under this government. There is the arts infolink which caters for something like 1,300 arts organisations and which has had over 300,000 hits on its web site, almost 80 per cent of which were in Australia, which shows that there is tremendous interest out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy is that only one side of politics is interested in the arts, and we will continue to ensure that this government is on the side of the arts community. We will ensure that where there are needs that can be met by government we will continue to meet them, and we will understand, as the opposition obviously do not, that there is a proper role to be played by government, not simply those who want to swan around as imperial leaders. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training.

I refer also to the government's assurances that reliable census data would be available by the end of August, data upon which the EBA calculation for 1998 would be based, which would enable an accurate assessment of the cost of the EBA to government schools. I ask: has that census been completed? If not, why not, and when do you expect it to be completed? If it has been completed, what does it show?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth contributes under its schools programs more in non&hyphen;government schools than in government schools because the states, through their grants systems, fund government schools.

These measures will position the industry to meet future challenges and competition.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Watson, for this important question. I think it is true that the community is recognising that tax reform is a very important priority. Many of us at the MPIA dinner  last night were very heartened to hear a major business group being extremely supportive of major tax reform in this country. It was not heartening for the Labor Party&mdash;and I will come to the Labor Party in a minute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only the business community and the welfare community but indeed sections of the Labor Party, I think it is true to say&mdash;not Mr Beazley and not the new Deputy Leader of the Labor Party in the Senate, Senator Cook&mdash;support tax reform. The reason for the support is that they have detected, as this government has detected, that there are serious problems with the current tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, it relies far too much on taxing income. I am looking to see whether Senator Cook is nodding at that&mdash;and I am not sure, but I think his head remains firmly still. We are just trying to detect, Senator Cook, whether you were one of the Young Turks. I know you could never be described as a Young Turk, Senator Cook, but I was just trying to detect whether you support that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second major problem with our tax system is that it relies too much on taxing goods while services, of course, are tax exempt. It is good to see that the business 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7705"> community and the welfare community are so strongly supportive of tax reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A problem that has to be recognised is that the Labor Party is in utter confusion on the tax reform front; it is in absolute and utter confusion. We heard Senator Hill inform the Senate what the new member of the Labor Party feels about taxes. He indicated that Mrs Kernot, who has been recruited to the Labor Party, supports a whole raft of new taxes, including inheritance taxes. I think you have a problem in the Labor Party, because you have recruited Mrs Kernot who, it has to be admitted, is on the far left of the political spectrum. But apparently the Labor Party has embraced her views, and it will be very interesting to see what emerges from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wayne Goss, another potential recruit to the federal parliament&mdash;and I draw this to the Labor Party's attention&mdash;said, `I believe that ordinary taxpayers are paying too much in income tax. We need to be looking at services. We need to be looking at the black economy.' So it is not only the Young Turks, Senator Cook, but a few of the older Turks who are coming in on this game. Wayne Goss is one who has recognised the major problems with the current tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a great pity that the Labor Party are refusing to join in in a constructive manner with this major issue of tax reform. They are receiving the same messages that we are receiving from the wider community that this is a priority, but we are seeing the same old Labor Party&mdash;the same negative Labor Party&mdash;using the same pathetic attempt at scare tactics, with no idea where the Labor Party stand. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank Senator Payne for that question. It is a very important question. I am pleased to advise the Senate that I have approved a grant to Pacific Power International to enable the company to work with Zhejiang Provincial Electrical Power Company in China to improve the economic and environmental performance of power generation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two power companies will take part in a power plant improvement study to identify low cost solutions to improve the efficiency and greenhouse performance of existing Chinese power stations. The study will  also demonstrate the capabilities of Australian industry to improve economic and environmental performance through the supply of high quality Australian coals and, equally&mdash;or more importantly&mdash;Australian clean coal technology and advice. I might point out to the Senate that the current production of coal in China is about 1.3 billion tonnes, with plans to extend that to about 1.5 billion tonnes, compared to Australia's production of about 240 million tonnes. So that gives you some idea of the differences in production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The study will make an important contribution to demonstrating Australia's commitment to help develop China's power sector in an environmentally responsible way. The importance of coal as an essential energy fuel in China's developments, and as Australia's largest export commodity, underlines the importance of initiatives of this nature. The alternative is that China will employ far fewer greenhouse friendly technologies and will consume ever increasing quantities of very low quality domestic coal. The study is expected to be completed in 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Improving power station performance in Asian developing economies is a cost&hyphen;effective way of achieving very large reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions. Refurbishing Asia's inefficient coal power stations has the potential to reduce C02 emissions by approximately 60 million tonnes, which is around 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> half of Australia's total emissions from all its coal fired power stations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By early next century, the total greenhouse gas emissions of large developing countries driven by those experiencing rapid economic growth will overtake those of developed countries. These developing country emissions are projected to grow by about four per cent a year while developed country emissions are projected to grow by about 1.3 per cent over the next several decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In China's case alone, carbon dioxide emissions in the energy sector are projected by the International Energy Agency to grow over the next two decades from about a quarter of the OECD emissions and just over 10 per cent of global emissions to about 40 per cent of OECD emissions, about one-sixth of total global emissions. An international greenhouse abatement agreement must deal with this degree of emissions growth in developing countries if it is to be effective, and Australia is pressing for equitable and achievable objectives at Kyoto that will encourage the eventual participation of developing countries in a truly global response to a global issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This new cooperative initiative with China is a tangible demonstration that win&hyphen;win solutions to difficult issues can be found. Our industry wins through new investment and technology development opportunities. The partner government&mdash;China, in this case&mdash;and industry certainly win.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The answer is "no" on both counts. The payments are not covered by the prudential fund because they are not refundable&mdash;they are regular payments which are equivalent to the retention and interest earned on a lump sum.

If he were to take the issue and really look at what is going on, he would know that it is about threats of violence&mdash;not necessarily overt but, in some cases, very covert violent threats towards people. What we have here is a dispute that took on a new and frightening dimension according to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>  on 20 October.

<PARA STYLE="Para">No&hyphen;one is arguing about the question of the protection of their own equipment, if that is

<PARA STYLE="Para">What we are seeing in this case is typical union busting tactics that are available and used in the United States, which have been perfected over a long period and are simply about the de&hyphen;unionisation of the work force. They are designed to achieve low wages,  lack of job security and a compliant, subjugated work force. That is what the agenda is and always has been about, Senator Crane.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That coincidentally is what this government's policies are about. You send in people to spy on the workers and to intimidate them as best you can. In some instances you threaten them directly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is well documented, Senator Macdonald. I would invite you to get the book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Union Busters</EMPHASIS>  and read how it is done. It is documented by union busters themselves how they systematically go about trying to break the will of the work force. United the work force can stand together to stick up for their rights. You people do not like that. You have no joy in that whatsoever. You have no joy in the fact that these people want a right to organise, want a right to freedom of association and want a right to collectively bargain. What is going on in Emerald at this stage is nothing more than a repetition of the American system and we are getting the worst parts of it. The worst parts of it seek to remove the rights of people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This crisis has been going a whole month. But the crisis would not be there if this government had some decent industrial relations laws which would see the resolution of problems. The thuggery that Senator Crane spoke about was quite unfair and quite un

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes and that is another issue. I can assure you of one thing: these vigilantes do resort to thuggery, they do resort to quite underhanded means of securing the aim for the companies in the end. In effect, if this government had decent IR laws then we would not have this problem in Emerald today. The truth of the matter is that the government does not want the problem resolved. This government feeds on this sort of thing because it builds up a picture out there in the community that there really is a problem.</PARA></TALK.START>

The government's approach to IR&mdash;and that is the real point of all of this&mdash;is a complete and utter farce. The nub of the problem for these people is that they are interested in their own job security. That is why they are fighting back, and if people do not fight back when job security is at stake when do they fight? They want to protect their livelihoods, their families. They do not want to be spied upon. They do not want to be stalked. They certainly want the right to defend their own rights.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the two previous speakers, I have been to Emerald on many occasions and I have also regrettably been in Emerald and the central Queensland coalfields when some very nasty strikes by the same people have taken place in the past. I find it just incredible that Senator Hogg and Senator Mackay can stand up here with a straight face and talk about intimidation by security guards at the mine properties. I can tell you that when these sorts of people are out rampaging on the streets and running the picket lines you are very lucky to get away without a broken skull if you are not a miner up there. It is a very ugly scene.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us get to the heart of the argument. The heart of the argument is not about wages and conditions or anything like that; it is about productivity. It is about getting from some of the lowest levels of production per worker in these mines with the best equipment in the world up to what is a reasonable world standard so that those miners can continue to receive the high wages they get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we have seen today from the opposition in the Senate is some archaic defence of the right of union thuggery. I am sorry, but you cannot do that today. While we are on the subject of thuggery, what do you say about somebody who goes in and bugs the managing director's house? It certainly was not the company who bugged the managing director's house. I think it is a pretty fair proposition that the union movement went in there and bugged his house.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the union movement is on about is not wanted by the majority of Australians. If the Labor Party were in touch with the Australian community, they would know they are pushing something that has no support in the community at all. Most Australians recognise that we live by a rule of law and they are prepared to see that rule of law changed through the proper place, which is this parliament. They know very well that if they take the law into their hands then the law of the jungle prevails.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the opening of this parliament we saw exactly the same union, I think, involved in that terrible incident of absolute anarchy where they did more than one&hyphen;quarter of a million dollars worth of damage to the entrance of this parliament. These are the same people, the rent&hyphen;a&hyphen;crowd mob from the union movement, that Senator Mackay and Senator Hogg are so strongly defending today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time the Jennie Georges and the John Maitlands of this world realised that they are out of step with society. That is why the union membership has collapsed. The membership is down to about one-third of what it was when I joined the work force and when I was a union member&mdash;and I am one of the few people in this place on this side of the chamber who has been an active union member. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7712">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a better way of doing things than the Labor Party way of confrontation, standoverism and intimidation. We do not want to see us go down that path. Let us reason together. If workers have a problem with management about their terms and conditions, they should sit down and talk to management. If they cannot reach a mutually satisfactory position, then the workers have every right to move on and find another  employer who will accommodate them. But they have no right to take to the streets, to close down the works and prevent them working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Senator Hogg to say that the government does not want the mine to produce is an absolute nonsense. I do not know the value of the Arco mine there but there might well be a capital investment of several hundred million dollars. Every day and every hour that the mine does not work costs the owners big money. They certainly want to see this mine in production and they are certainly entitled to go about their business of running that mine the way they wish to run it for the benefit of their own investors.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the aftermath of a dispute that has essentially been generated by your industrial relations reform. It comes directly out of your AWAs and the reform of industrial relations implemented by your government, and that is very clear. Let us look at what this company said five years ago when it was operating under a different industrial relations system&mdash;when it was operating under an industrial relations system that was about trying to create cooperation in the workplace, trying to get workers and management to work together to build productivity in the workplace and to get better productivity and better outcomes for the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This company produced a video describing its operation at Gordonstone. What do the opening words of the song in that video say? They say, `Gordonstone miners are the world's best mining team.' They were the opening words of the song in the video produced by this company. Yet three or four years later we have the same company saying, `This is the world's worst mining team. We've got to get rid of them out of the mine,' and they sacked 300 of them. They say, `Not only have we got to get them out of the mine, we've got to drive them out of the town.' That is what this agenda is all about. They have to drive them out of their homes and get them away from the place and open the doors for non-union labour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has changed over that three- or four&hyphen;year period? What has changed has been the introduction of your industrial relations reforms which are saying to companies, `Don't worry about negotiations. Don't worry about trying to work with your work force. We will support you in taking whatever 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7713"> action you want to take in order to get the changes you want to implement in the workplace.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only thing that shocks me about what is occurring at Gordonstone is that one of the minority shareholders in that mine is Lend Lease, a company that had a history of good industrial relations in this country. I do not know what influence they can bring to bear on that dispute or what is occurring in that area, but if they can they ought to be trying to exert whatever influence they can to try to turn the situation around in that place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that you have introduced industrial relations reform in this country which was bred out of the 19th century. It is the type of industrial relations we saw in this country in the 1890s when we saw shearers shot because they dared to take strike action to defend their rights. We are seeing the same type of intimidation recurring in the 1990s. A famous philosopher once said events occur in history twice: the first time as tragedy and the second time as farce. What is occurring in Gordonstone is an absolute farce which is perpetrated and generated by your industrial relations reform.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Campbell does bring it out in me, Madam Deputy President. He is proud of the fact that he belongs to those dinosaur days of the union movement, which today's union movement is paying a very high price for, given the membership collapse that they are now suffering. He is proud of those days of well-known thuggery on the wharves, in the meatworks and of course in the manufacturers union, unto which you only have 100,000 unemployed people around your neck.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could go tit for tat with regard to stories being told of thuggery on the union side. We could, for example, look at the waterfront. They will shut the nation down at the drop of a hat costing our export income hundreds of millions of dollars. Most of them within that union are shadowy characters. The threat of strike is always hanging above our 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7714"> rural sector in particular, the sector that I represent. That threat is always standing over them. Those on the waterfront would prefer the exports to rot on the wharves than that union be upset in any way at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such is the tit for tat we can go for. If there is a problem in those coalfields, as you have put it, give us a bit of real hard evidence. Don't run it off a TV show. We do not accept any link with our industrial relations laws. But if there is this sort of thuggery and gun carrying that you are talking about, well look into it. We do not accept that sort of behaviour in this country at all, but don't try to link it with our industrial relations laws. In fact, when it comes to defending our industrial relations laws, I am only too pleased to have the opportunity to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are certain parts of that industrial relations law&mdash;supported by the Democrats, I might add, and I will add that many times over every time we get a chance&mdash;that you have never been able to accept because, in many respects, it goes to the heart of the union's past thuggery behaviour. For example, the secondary boycott&mdash;the introduction of section 45D of the Trade Practices Act. That has been specifically introduced to prevent the thuggery of unions ganging up against one employer and putting them out of business. Of course, the masters of that were the waterfront workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition have never been able to accept the freedom of association that we have introduced. That should be a basic right for any worker: they either want to join a union or not. You used to bully workers into the union. You used to drive them out of the workplace unless they joined a union. These are just two incidences that we have addressed in our industrial relations legislation which prevent the old&hyphen;time thuggery of the unions.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are still the only Australians, sent overseas on active service, whose service has not been recognised in three important areas:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1997 Budget the Government partly recognised that R.A.N. service was `operational' and accepted responsibility for disabilities resulting from that service.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill represents a further significant milestone in the development of environment protection in Australia.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It bears repeating that the objectives of the measures are to ensure that people, wherever they live in Australia, enjoy the benefit of equivalent protection from air, water, soil pollution and noise and secondly, to ensure that decisions by business are not distorted and markets are not fragmented by variations between jurisdictions in relation to the adoption or implementation of major environment protection measures.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the implementation of NEPMs by another law of the Commonwealth if the Environment Minister is satisfied it will achieve appropriate environmental outcomes. One of the Objects of the Airport (Environmental Protection) Regulations, made under the Airports Act 1996, is to establish, in conjunction with NEPMs, a Commonwealth system of regulation for activities at airports that generate, or have the potential to generate, pollution or excessive noise. By operating in conjunction with NEPMs, it is my view that the Regulations will provide the appropriate environmental outcomes.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National environment protection measures must also be consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development as outlined in the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As stated earlier, the National Environment Protection Council is developing draft measures for the National Pollutant Inventory and ambient air quality. Both these measures aim to address issues of national significance.

Development of a measure for ambient air quality recognises the intense community concerns about air pollution.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The passage of the National Environmental Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill is a landmark event for environmental management in Australia. The legislation will provide the implementation vehicle for the development of national environment protection measures on, as I have mentioned 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7723"> previously, a range of issues including air and water pollution, contaminated sites assessment, the transport of hazardous wastes across borders, in some instances, motor vehicle emissions, and the re&hyphen;use and recycling of used materials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cooperation between the Commonwealth and State and Territory governments in the development of measures represents a major benefit not only to the people of Australia and to the environment, but also to Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be benefits to the environment through the close attention given to the specific environment issues and to identifying an effective environmental outcome in development of national environment protection measures. The Australian people will benefit through having access to equivalent protection from pollutants wherever they live in Australia, and industry will benefit from ensuring competitive neutrality in relation to their activities throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even though the current agenda for the measures is relatively extensive, there may be calls in the future to extend the range of measures which can be dealt with under the National Environment Protection Council Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, for the moment, we can look forward to the early development of an ambient air quality measure, the National Pollutant Inventory measure, a measure on the transport of hazardous wastes across State or Territory borders and one on guidelines for assessment of contaminated sites. The work required for the development of a measure is extensive and resources have been stretched in all jurisdictions to develop the first measures for ambient air quality and the National Pollutant Inventory, which I hope will be finalised and gazetted in February 1998 ready for the implementation phase.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the National Environmental Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill to you as an important achievement in environmental management for Australia and for all Australians.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Reply to Senator Parer</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1994 I was invited by Caroline Jones to be a guest on her ABC Radio program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The</EMPHASIS>  <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Search for Meaning. The Search for Meaning </EMPHASIS> was a long&hyphen;running program that provided an opportunity for well&hyphen;known people to discuss their personal spiritual and religious journeys. It was difficult for me to decide whether to accept the invitation to appear because it would require some very intimate revelations about my own spiritual journey. I feared that I may be misunderstood and, possibly, ridiculed by people who have little understanding of powerful spiritual experiences. After the program, I had many letters and telephone calls from people around Australia thanking me for my willingness to speak of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Parer has selected from the one&hyphen;hour interview my description of the stage of the spiritual journey known as the `confrontation with the shadow', a well&hyphen;known aspect of the process of `individuation', that is, the process of achieving 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> psychological wholeness. There is an extensive psychological literature on this process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many eminent Australians&mdash;including authors, scientists, poets, academics and religious leaders&mdash;have spoken or written of similar experiences, as any regular listener of Caroline Jones' program would know. The experience of confronting the shadow is a persistent theme of the world's literature. Some celebrated examples include Goethe's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Faust </EMPHASIS> and Dante's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inferno. </EMPHASIS> I could name dozens more which deal with it explicitly. The theme also figures prominently in Australian literature including the work of A. D. Hope and Patrick White, the latter in his seminal work <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voss,</EMPHASIS>  to name but two.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This literature in turn reflects the graphic treatment of these experiences in the great religious writings of the world. They feature prominently in both the old and new testaments of the Bible and in the Bhagavad&hyphen;Gita, to mention only two. Several of the best&hyphen;known Christian theologians, including St John of the Cross, Master Eckhart and Hildegard of Bingen, provide detailed accounts of their experiences which closely resemble mine in form, content and resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was shocked to hear Senator Parer use intimate revelations about my spiritual journey in an attempt to undermine my credibility as a commentator on climate change policy. I have been critical of the Government's economic arguments about the impact of measures to reduce greenhouse gases for some time. At no stage has Senator Parer responded to my arguments or the evidence I have adduced. Now he has used Question Time in the Senate to launch a pre&hyphen;meditated personal attack on me by way of my religious experience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My credentials as a commentator on climate change policy have not been questioned by anyone, but in case any observer should have doubts after Senator Parer's attack I would like to record the following. I hold a degree in Pure Mathematics from the Australian National University and a First Class Honours degree in Economics from the University of Sydney. I was offered a doctoral place at Cambridge University but chose to take my doctorate at the University of Sussex. My thesis was a general equilibrium model of development and was published internationally. I was subsequently employed as a Research Fellow at the Australian National University and served as the Director of the Graduate Program in the Economics of Development. I joined the Commonwealth Public Service in 1987 and was appointed to the Senior Executive Service in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to my role as Executive Director of the Australia Institute, I am a Visiting Fellow in Public Policy at the Australian National University and an Adjunct Professor at the University of Technology, Sydney. I have served on a United Nations Expert Group on Least Developed Countries and have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7726"> frequently been asked to present papers at conferences and seminars in Australia and abroad. I have been a senior adviser to the Government of Indonesia, employed by the US Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have published widely, including four books and many articles in Australian and international refereed academic journals. Several of these articles have been written jointly with some of Australia's most respected academic economists. Three of Australia's most eminent academic economists&mdash;Professor Peter Dixon of Monash University, Professor Tor Hundloe of the University of Queensland and Professor John Quiggin of James Cook University&mdash;joined with me in preparing a statement on climate change that challenged the Government's arguments, a statement that was signed by 131 professional Australian economists.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been employed to carry out research into climate change policy by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, the Department of Environment Sport and Territories, the Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, and the Sustainable Energy Development Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I take offence at Senator Parer's reference to me as `anti&hyphen;Australian'. I am very proud of being an Australian. I founded The Australia Institute&mdash;an independent non&hyphen;profit research centre&mdash;in order to help make Australia a more just, sustainable and peaceful country. I believe that the Government's present climate change policy will cause serious damage to Australia's short&hyphen;term and long&hyphen;term interests, and find it disturbing that those who disagree with the Government are branded `anti&hyphen;Australian'.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1997&hyphen;98 Budget demonstrates the Federal Government's continuing commitment to caring for Australia's veterans and their families. As well as initiatives to assist them live the independent lives of their choice, the opportunity has been taken to streamline administration and remove anomalies in entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1997&hyphen;98 Budget continued the Government's four&hyphen;year commemorative program, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Their Service&hyphen;Our Heritage</EMPHASIS> , which will encourage all Australians to remember the sacrifice and service of our veterans across the years. Commemorating the service rendered by men and women in uniform has become an integral part of Australia's way of life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, remembering the fallen is not enough; we must also continue to look after the living. This bill will give legislative effect to a Budget initiative to extend eligibility for disability pension and access to Repatriation health care arrangements to an additional 10,500 veterans. Some veterans will also benefit by gaining eligibility for the service pension and Defence Service Homes loans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This initiative arises out of a recent review of perceived anomalies in eligibility for veterans' entitlements for overseas deployments since World War 2. This review was foreshadowed in the Government's election policy statement, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lest We Forget.</EMPHASIS>  The review sought fairness and consistency in applying the longstanding principles underlying access to Repatriation benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eligibility for disability pension and benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 will now be available to veterans who had seagoing Naval service with the Far East Strategic Reserve between 1955 and 1963, to veterans who served in North East Thailand between 1962 and 1968, and to veterans who served in Japan with the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces between 1949 and 1951. Eligibility for disability pensions will also be extended to veterans who served in various other overseas deployments in the post&hyphen;war years. Qualifying service for service pension will be extended to Embassy Guards and RAAF personnel who served in Vietnam between 1973 and 1975. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important change in this bill is the automatic extension of eligibility for Repatriation benefits to veterans for any overseas operational service determined to be warlike or non&hyphen;warlike by the Minister for Defence. These are classifications now used by the Department of Defence to cover operations of higher risk than normal peace&hyphen;time service. The inclusion of these classifications of service will give veterans greater certainty about their eligibility under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 before they commence future overseas deployments. In addition, these classifications should minimise the potential for anomalies to occur in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another 1997&hyphen;98 Budget initiative in this bill will allow all disability pensioners, war widow and war widower pensioners access to a lump sum advance of their pension, up to a maximum of $500 a year. Previously, this advance has been available to income support pensioners only. These changes recognise the benefit of allowing people with continuing Commonwealth pensions greater flexibility and choice as to how they access their pension payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also introduces a reform to the Repatriation system that reflects a greater public awareness of the medical consequences of tobacco use and the current initiatives to discourage smoking within the general community and also within the Defence Forces. If, in the past, veterans did not know the dangers of smoking, or if they were encouraged to use tobacco, this is certainly not true for veterans today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will no longer be liable for compensation for the medical consequences of smoking tobacco if the person takes up the habit after 31 December 1997, or if the consequences are due to an increase in smoking after 31 December 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will not affect veterans who acquired a service related smoking habit before 1 January 1998, unless the medical consequences are due only to a later increase in tobacco use. However, let me stress that if smoking is only one of the causal factors in the development of a condition, then there will still be eligibility for compensation for the incapacity or death if other, service&hyphen;related factors exist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another 1997&hyphen;98 Budget initiative in this bill streamlines the determination of a service pensioner's eligibility for medical treatment at the expense of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. As a result of this simplification and the associated removal of anomalies, about 100 veterans will gain access to treatment benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also includes a number of initiatives the Government announced as part of its 1996&hyphen;97 Budget.  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7728">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of these initiatives is the rationalisation of the administration and payment of pensions between the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Social Security. This reflects the Government's commitment to administrative reform to streamline the delivery of Government services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will allow age pensioners, who also receive a veteran's disability pension, to choose to be paid both pensions by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. For the veterans, and their eligible partners, it will mean that they need deal with only one Department. Veterans will have the choice whether to use this agency arrangement. It is a popular option with over 10,000 veterans already asking the Department of Veterans' Affairs to manage all payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides for all carer payments to be managed by the Department of Social Security. Most of the carer payments made by the Department of Veterans' Affairs will  be transferred to Social Security. A few carer payments will remain with Veterans' Affairs to either preserve their carer payment which is at a rate higher than they would otherwise receive from Social Security, or avoid the inconvenience of the carer having to reapply to the Department of Veterans' Affairs when they become eligible for another form of income support payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another 1996&hyphen;97 Budget initiative in this bill will establish a Vocational Rehabilitation Scheme for veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government undertook to closely monitor the long term care needs of Vietnam veterans and this measure has been long awaited by the Vietnam veteran community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Scheme will provide for early intervention for younger veterans leaving the Forces and support for Vietnam veterans. It will assist veterans to find employment and to continue in employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of the legislation for the Scheme, and of the Scheme itself, has been the subject of extensive consultation with the ex&hyphen;service community. Thanks go to the veteran community for their assistance in developing this Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Scheme will be available to all eligible veterans, but special provision has been made for those veterans who are receiving a disability pension or a service pension on the grounds that they are prevented by their incapacity from working full&hyphen;time. The legislation presented guarantees veterans who volunteer to take part in a rehabilitation program under the Scheme will not have their disability pension reduced while participating in that program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation ensures the veteran will receive at least the same income, from earnings and disability pension combined, as he or she would have re 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ceived as a disability pensioner had the veteran not participated in the</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">rehabilitation program and entered employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If, at any time, the veteran ceases employment he or she will revert to the rate of disability pension payable when the rehabilitation program was initially undertaken</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These safeguards and guarantees remove disincentives for veterans to volunteer for rehabilitation back into the workforce. The benefits veterans may obtain from participating in a rehabilitation program go beyond the financial advantages. These programs increase a person's self reliance and ability to cope with life's tasks, provide opportunities for socialisation, and can help improve the quality of the participant's life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before concluding, I want to say the Government is making significant improvements to the way the functions of the Department of Veterans' Affairs are managed and delivered. This includes the selective outsourcing of functions where the private sector can deliver quality service at a price that the public sector cannot match. The Department of Veterans' Affairs has been very innovative in this area, as evidenced by its extensive health and hospital service purchasing, and more recently, by the outsourcing of its computer infrastructure. This was a first for the Commonwealth public service. It will mean better service for the veteran community and better value for the taxpayer's dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taken as a whole, the measures in this bill will result in better policy, more efficient administration and, most importantly, a better quality of life for the veteran community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Workplace Relations Amendment Bill is one of the most blatant pieces of political propaganda to be put before the Senate in the last 18 months. It is nothing more than a con. It is a stunt and it is an act of utter desperation by what has increasingly become a desperate government. It is a con with regard to the small business community. All this government is really interested in is media headlines. This legislation will not help small business. Once again, this legislation is all about the government trying to make people believe that it is actually doing something.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When talking about make believe, it is also interesting to note the lengths that this government has gone to to try and con the Australian public into believing that this bill is making changes to Labor legislation with regard to unfair dismissal. This is not the case. This government is actually attempting to change its own legislation&mdash;legislation which, incidentally, has been in operation for only nine months. I think it is very important to get that on the record because, if you believe the spin by Mr Reith, you would think that this legislation is about amending the now opposition's old unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exemption is inherently unfair, it is inherently unnecessary and it is a breach of the government's pre-election commitments. This will come as no surprise to people in this chamber and as no surprise to people in the Australian community. This government declared again and again that there would not be any exemption for small business from the unfair dismissal provisions. As clearly documented in the minority report of the opposi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion and the Democrats, both John Howard and Peter Reith&mdash;with hand on heart, saying, `Trust me, I am from the government'&mdash;declared that this exemption would not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at a bit of history with regard to the government's pre-election commitments on this. On the John Laws show on 23 January 1996, John Howard stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I'm not going to have a law where an unreasonable employer can capriciously sack a decent, hard&hyphen;working employee.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the first thing he said. Let us have a look at what Peter Reith said. On ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daybreak</EMPHASIS> , 28 February 1996, he stated quite succinctly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Look, our position's very clear. If you've been unfairly dealt with at work, then you should have a right of appeal.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is not much leeway there. Both John Howard and Peter Reith have been absolutely clear, quite consistently, that there will not be an exemption contemplated by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">History moves on. John Howard and Peter Reith then went on to give themselves a big pat on the back when commenting on the new Workplace Relations Act. In his speech on the return of the bill from the Senate on 21 November 1996, Peter Reith said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have delivered a workable system for dealing with unfair dismissal on the basis of a fair go all round and, in doing so, we have expressed an overwhelming community consensus that the previous . . . system did nothing more than stifle employment growth and create division in the workplace. This was Labor's legacy, and the government has buried it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his 1996 progress report to the people on 11 December 1996, the Prime Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am proud to say that the previous government's . . . unfair dismissal laws have gone. They have been replaced with a simpler, more balanced system that provides a fair go all round. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7730">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a comment on legislation that the government is seeking to amend here today. Unfortunately, for a large number of employees, this government has once again shown that it cannot be trusted. It does not stick to its word. What this bill seeks to do is to take unfair dismissal rights away from Australians who are employed in a business with 15 or fewer employees, except for apprentices. For these workers&mdash;we are talking about one-third of the Australian work force&mdash;there will be no right of appeal, no justice and no equality under the law. So much for the comments of Mr Reith and Mr Howard!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seeks to take away rights from Australians so that they are no longer protected from harsh, unfair and unreasonable dismissal. Nobody could call that an Australian activity. It is not what the Australian community is about. Australian workers and Australian small business do not support it, and I will go on to explain why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is on very shaky ground indeed with regard to this legislation, and the government knows it. This government wants to give employers the right to sack workers unfairly. There is no other way that it can be construed. The current unfair dismissal provisions apply to all employers irrespective of size. There are, however, some exemptions to these provisions, which include employees serving a probationary period provided that the period was determined in advance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority report from the government presented to the Senate on Monday offers no legitimate reasons as to why this should be changed. The government states in its report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the current legislation was `too legalistic and too prescriptive' and therefore providing Government with the motive for change.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The current legislation provides that employees cannot be terminated for reasons that are harsh, unjust or unreasonable. What part of that is too legalistic? The legislation is clear. Australians understand what the legislation means. Small businesses understand what the legislation means. I totally agree with Senator Murray's comments in his report where he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report of the Coalition is analytically weak and is not persuasive. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the understatement of the decade. He also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we are dealing with is a perception manufactured by the Coalition, that their unfair dismissal laws inhibit job creation in small business. The reality is that those new laws do not.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition has deliberately and cynically tried to create a statistical no-go area. It has indulged in statistical subterfuge.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This subterfuge is all too evident to people who attended the hearings of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee given the fact that, as we discovered yesterday, the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business in its own survey gave small business the option of naming the unfair dismissal provisions as the reason for not increasing employment. When the department rang small business, it asked, `Are the unfair dismissal provisions a disincentive?' This was under the old legislation, not the government's legislation. But small business did not and they did not cite it as a reason. It was not even mentioned. So the department did not include it in its report because it rated so low. It was very conveniently omitted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Murray hit the nail on the head when he cites in his report the reason for the subterfuge. He quite frankly says&mdash;and I think he is absolutely correct:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It remains my belief that the Coalition introduced this single-issue Bill encapsulating gross unfairness, to provoke the Senate to absolute rejection. It remains my belief that this Bill was conceived to achieve a double-dissolution trigger.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Spot on, Senator Murray; that is absolutely correct. The small business community certainly do not want the exemption, they do not need it and they did not ask for it. That is the reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at why this is before us. I think Senator Murray has quite accurately described the double dissolution trigger aspect and the very weak response by the government in its is majority report as to the requirement for this legislation. Let us have a look at what is going on in the Liberal Party at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had the somewhat unedifying sight of the Treasurer, Mr Costello, in his address to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7731"> the MTIA last night basically trumpeting the fact that he had won in cabinet with regard to spiking a more strategic interventionist approach to the economy versus what the MTIA and the majority of industry want, which is a more interventionist approach&mdash;that is, assistance, encouragement and a reason for the government to play a bigger role with regard to economic development industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In term of the MTIA's seven statements as to why it believes that its case should have been taken up by the government, Mr Costello did not get past the first two. So he has clearly won! What we have within the Liberal Party is a call for further reform with regard to industrial relations. That was very adequately described by Senator Vanstone, who let the cat out of the bag when she said, `What we need, as it were, is less job security.' That is what certain sections of the Liberal Party are about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this is really about&mdash;and I think everybody knows it&mdash;is internal divisions within the Liberal Party and who is going to be the next leader of the Liberal Party. Will it be Mr Reith or will it be Mr Costello?</PARA>

Peter Costello is positioning himself for a move. That has been publicly speculated so it will come as no surprise to people in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the empirical evidence as to why this legislation is not necessary. I will quote here from the minority report prepared by the Labor Party members and Senator Murray from the Democrats. The Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business produced the following evidence to the Senate committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there has been a significant decrease in the number of applications made under the federal unfair dismissal legislation. In the first 37 weeks of 1996 there were 10,408 applications under the then 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Industrial Relations Act 1988; in the first 37 weeks of 1997 . . . there were 4,801 applications under the Workplace Relations Act&mdash;that is, a decrease by 54%&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and this relates to all unfair dismissal claims. So under the government's new legislation, which was much vaunted by the government, there was a 54 per cent decrease with regard to unfair dismissal claims. You would have thought that that would have been fairly adequate, but no. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . statistics from the 1995/96 Industrial Relations Court Annual Report show that . . . perhaps contrary to popular misconception, small business has fewer unfair dismissal claims than other employers: only a third of [unfair dismissal claims] is from the small business sector notwithstanding that 91.7% of employers have fewer than 20 employees.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Pretty persuasive stuff I would have thought. Our report concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . less than 1 in every 100 involuntary dismissals in small business are now affected by federal unfair dismissal claims.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Claims and applications since the government's unfair dismissal laws came into operation have been dramatically reduced&mdash;that is, claims against all business, not just against small business. I refer the chamber to page 21 of our report with regard to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is this happening? We have already cited the reason of internal divisions within the Liberal Party, but let us have a look at the economy. This bill is the political equivalent of kicking the cat. When you have got nothing else to do, when the economy is flatlining, when unemployment is going up and when economic growth is flatlining, what do you do? Let us imagine the discussion around the cabinet room, `I know. Let's bring in a bill to exempt small business from unfair dismissal. That is at least a bit of a symbol or a sign that we are attempting to do something because we can't get the economic fundamentals right.' That is the reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's central premise with regard to this legislation is that their own unfair dismissal laws provide a disincentive to employment. Despite the changed unfair dismissal laws, employment has not increased under this government. I know senators on the other side of the chamber do not like hearing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7732"> this but let us revisit the figures since the government came to office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment is currently running at 8.6 per cent. When the government came into power it was running at 8.4 per cent. You do not have to be Einstein to work out there is clearly a huge unemployment problem that this government, by its actions, has not addressed. The participation rate is again stagnant at 63 per cent. The number of long-term unemployed has grown by 70,000 in the past year to 411,000. Those statistics were from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on Friday. Our foreign debt&mdash;something that does not get much of a run these days&mdash;has risen above $220 billion, up 2.2 per cent on the previous quarter. Peter Costello said that Australia would grow by four per cent.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9L6">Senator MACKAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not on familiar terms anyway. Mr Costello has said that Australia would grow by four per cent. That is the government's objective and that is what Mr Howard said in his headland speech prior to the election. What have we got? At the end of the June quarter, we left the last financial year with a growth rate of 2.5 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The job creation figure of 75,000 jobs is effectively only one per cent seasonally adjusted. That is extremely weak employment growth for a whole year&mdash;pathetically weak, I would venture to suggest. The government has made much of the growth of 16 per cent in private sector investment outcomes. That is true, but most of that investment&mdash;if you disaggregate and examine those figures&mdash;was already in place when this government came in. In any event, even if the government were to claim some kind of a pyrrhic victory with regard to that private sector growth, it has not created any jobs&mdash;no jobs. The 1997-98 business expectation figures are as flat as a pancake. New capital expenditure is $39.46 billion for 1996-97. The whole economy is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stagnant and economic growth is flatline&mdash;no growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This government believes that their own unfair dismissal laws are a significant deterrent to small business employing more people. Let us have a look at what the government cited as empirical evidence  to sustain this claim. They quoted the employment survey by Morgan and Banks. However, they did not mention that this survey shows that 78.9 per cent of small businesses were not affected by the laws in their decisions to hire new staff. They also failed to note that only 2.7 per cent said the laws meant they had hired significantly fewer employees. This survey was carried out before the government's amendments to the then unfair dismissals laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also cited the Recruitment Solutions survey. This survey is severely in doubt because it is completely out of line with statistics provided by the ABS, the IRC and DIR. In the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, or TCCI, survey, unfair dismissals were ranked 11th out of 58 business issues. The government said: `This is a very severe problem that Tasmanian business believe unfair dismissal is 11th out of 58 variables with regard to being a disincentive to creating employment.' When you have a look at what the first 10 issues were, they included such things as parliamentary reform. But, most importantly, what it revealed was the fact that the demand was not there. The problem is that the demand is not there in the economy to employ people, and it is not going to magically appear by removing the unfair dismissal provisions. Life, unfortunately, is not like that. But that is the reality. The government cited that TCCI survey as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that ACCI were the only employer group to front the committee. Quite frankly, they provided quite spurious evidence, which I understand Senator Jacinta Collins will expand on later. ACCI's assertions were simply not backed up with any empirical evidence. In terms of the submission ACCI provided to the legislation committee, I guess you have to wonder whom they have been talking to and, more appositely, what group they think they represent. The  department itself referred selectively to survey 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7733"> evidence, but it actually failed to refer to its own far more credible survey even though its survey specifically addressed the question of unfair dismissals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then go to the Yellow Pages survey. We are trawling around here to try to find some reason as to why the government wants to introduce this legislation, some actual hard empirical data. The May Yellow Pages survey clearly showed that of those businesses surveyed 37 per cent believed barriers existed to investment expenditure. In the responses, 32 per cent indicated cash flow, 23 per cent indicated lack of work, 19 per cent indicated profitability and nine per cent indicated the economic climate as reasons. Only three per cent indicated cost of employing staff&mdash;we are assuming this may include the unfair dismissal laws&mdash;as a barrier to investment expenditure. It is obvious that small business simply do not regard the government's unfair dismissal laws as a disincentive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the August Yellow Pages survey, businesses were asked: `What are the barriers to taking on new employees?' Not surprisingly, lack of work was the overwhelming response with 42 per cent. Significantly, on an unprompted response, the unfair dismissal laws did not even rate a mention. As I said, it just makes you wonder who the government is talking to and who ACCI is talking to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conclude, we oppose this legislation. At a time when job security is probably the most important issue for Australian workers, we believe that it is completely unfair to deprive one&hyphen;third of Australian employees from having that recourse. The small business community do not want it, they do not need it and they did not ask for it. This has the potential to encourage worst practice&mdash;not best practice&mdash;from unscrupulous employers who will be given the right to hire and fire at will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This exemption will clearly add to job insecurity difficulties. The bottom line is that this exemption has the potential to lead to anarchy and turmoil in the workplace. It will not assist with employment; it will not assist with improving the growth of the economy. It just will not help. It is just a cheap political stunt and a few good headlines for Mr

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R245">Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  is the second attempt by this government to impose its ill&hyphen;considered and discriminatory proposal to exempt businesses employing no more than 15 workers from the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. In late June 1997, the Senate voted to disallow regulations under the act which have the same intent as the bill before us today. At that time, I voted for the disallowance and I see no need to change my position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in the debate on the Workplace Relations Bill in November 1996, the unfair dismissal provisions, as they existed at the time of that debate, had not been given a proper chance to be evaluated. It is interesting to note in the committee report on this bill that Senator Murray had used a similar argument in relation to the new unfair dismissal regime that took effect after the proclamation of the Workplace Relations Act 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I am pleased to see that he and the Australian Democrats will not be supporting this bill and its further diminution of workers' rights in relation to unfair dismissal, I wish that he&mdash;and to some extent the ALP&mdash;had listened to the likes of Justice Murray Wilcox, whom I quoted in the debate on the unfair dismissal provisions in the 1996 act. He argued that his contact with business groups indicated to him that the pre Workplace Relations Act provisions in relation to unfair dismissals were `working very smoothly'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that many people have been hoodwinked into believing that there is a massive problem with unfair dismissal and that business, especially small business, is being hamstrung by unworkable regulations with respect to the dismissal of their employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that what is not being taken into consideration is the major issues affecting small business, that is, getting people through their door. That relates to people's level of spendable income, their discretionary income&mdash;that is, that level of income above  what they need for their absolute necessities 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7734"> such as housing, rent and food, that amount that they can spend on goods and services. Many of these people are from small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very large factor in people's spending patterns is whether they think they are going to be employed this week, next week or next month. So people's certainty or uncertainty about their job security is a very large factor in whether they support small business, or whether they support large business, whether they are able to spend any discretionary income that they have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has a very reductionist way of thinking. They think that whatever seems to be good for an individual small business&mdash;trying to make your employees as vulnerable as possible, keeping down wages and conditions and so on&mdash;is necessarily going to be good for the whole small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like people to go back and at least read some of the issues that were brought up from the 1930s, in particular some of the work of John Maynard Keynes. He was not actually radical, but he did say&mdash;and it is a very important point&mdash;that what is good for one part of the economy is not necessarily good for the whole economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the whole `greed is good' phenomenon was about people spending more money so that big businesses made a lot of money. We have a society that is based on a greed principle. That is what the market is all about. People will spend&mdash;that is fine; that is what that principle is about. But we are extrapolating what appears to be what an individual small business might want&mdash;that is, to keep their costs down to a minimum, to be able to have the maximum flexibility with their particular employees&mdash;and we assume that putting that out to the whole economy is going to be good for the economy. Clearly, it is not. And that does not appear to be the major issue for small business and many other businesses in Australia. It is about the industrial structure; it is about the way communities are operating and the way the economy is performing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many instances, it can be about whether there is a range of industries within an area, so that they are not dependent on one major 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry which might have problems and then create pressure for all the rest. There are a whole lot of issues. I believe that trying to pretend to small business that you are doing something about their concerns is a very simplistic and erroneous way to deal with the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the need to sack an employee does arise, the employee is entitled to basic procedural fairness. I do not think that is unreasonable. The government's claims that this initiative will promote employment is laughable. The committee report on this bill by Senator Ferguson, on behalf of the government, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is widely regarded that regulation in the labour market is an obstacle for employment growth, particularly in relation to small business. The more labour regulation, the less incentives are given to business to employ higher volumes of staff.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This faith in deregulation is totally misplaced. As I have mentioned before, it will create substantially greater uncertainty in the community and, ironically, it will mostly be small businesses that will suffer as consumer confidence plummets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the Greens believe that the pre Workplace Relations Act provisions were reasonable and had not had a reasonable time to be evaluated. The 1996 act further eroded workers' rights, and this bill proposes to minimise the protections for specific categories of workers. Whilst I acknowledge that these changes relate to unfair as opposed to unlawful dismissal and that they apply only to workers employed in small businesses with no more than 15 permanent employees, who are covered under the federal act, I do not see the need for any category of worker to be treated in an unfair manner and be exempted from these basic protections. Therefore, we will not be supporting this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson. I presume you are going to be dispassionate and objective whilst you are in the chair, as the signatory to the majority report by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. As always, the secretariat did a good job, because the three reports present 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7735"> ed cover the range of views that were required to be covered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most importantly, the very way in which the secretariat wrote their report indicated their lack of real professional support, if you like, for an absolutely insupportable argument. They could not find the evidence. That secretariat&mdash;for whom I have the highest regard, as I know all senators do&mdash;damned you with the very faint ability they could bring to your particular report, simply because the evidence and the arguments were not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I get somewhat distressed when I encounter in this sort of situation a minister for whom I have the highest professional regard, and I refer to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith). He is a minister whose professional experience, seniority and understanding of the political process in both houses and whose ability to manage his portfolios are quite exceptional within the government and the range of talent they have within their front bench. Yet, this is a minister who has broken an agreement with me and my party in introducing this and who, I believe, has indulged in statistical subterfuge to arrive at a position which is not justified by the facts and which is not justified by anything other than cruel and heartless politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not really mind the minister playing hard ball with Labor or the Democrats on political issues and the business of muscling through policies, philosophies, ideologies and perspectives. I do mind when the issue that comes to mind is that of treating workers unfairly, of allowing 1.6 million workers&mdash;one&hyphen;quarter of the work force&mdash;to feel that their very job security and the very rights that are available to the rest of the work force will be denied them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you take such a position, if you are going to take such a position, you can only ever do so in the belief that the greater good&mdash;the greater public interest available to our community&mdash;will be served and that the evil that will be done will be less, much less, than the good that will be done. That is why I began this address by referring to the lack of evidence to support that proposition. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor Party report very ably rebutted that proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the Senate that, under the Brereton laws&mdash;the previous minister's labour laws&mdash;the growth rate in employment generation in small business was double that of large business. So, even in those days, the proposition that there was major job restriction consequences to those laws was on somewhat shaky empirical grounds. But now that the new laws actually have cut unfair dismissal applications by 52 per cent&mdash;let us repeat that, it is half: from 15,000&hyphen;odd to just over 6,000 out of over eight million employees&mdash;you have to worry and wonder why the government has introduced this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have made the point in my minority report that I believe that, whereas in the early days they put up the regulation which the Senate rejected&mdash;and it may have been provoked by the somewhat macho contest between the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the minister, who is the heir apparent&mdash;this particular bill has been introduced with the knowledge that the Senate, in its wisdom, would find it repugnant and would reject it. It is a single issue bill, and it would give them a double dissolution trigger. Whether they use it or not, every government likes to have such a thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Speaking for myself and my party, I do not mind giving you a double dissolution trigger if it means rejecting a bill which delivers gross unfairness and gross insecurity to the workers who are at the most vulnerable end of our community. Incidentally, according to the union representation in the committees, only a very minor percentage of workers are unionised in retail&mdash;I think they gave the figure of some two per cent. It is the job of the government to look after the weak and vulnerable. It is the job of the government, if it says it represents battlers, to be concerned about those battlers. They are not union hacks; they are people who are not represented by organised labour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say, and I believe many people say, that this exemption&mdash;this right to sack workers unfairly&mdash;for small businesses with fewer than 15 members will create job insecurity and not jobs. No evidence of any substance was presented to the committee, and nor has any 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7736"> been presented whilst this issue has been available over many years, to prove that doing this will result in job creation. That is the first thing we reject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second aspect we reject is that the new laws are inadequate. I am aware that many Labor Party senators and unionists think that the new laws go too far. The fact is that they deliver, in our view, the minimum level of equity and natural justice required to protect a worker from being harshly, unjustly or unfairly dismissed. The numbers are not enormous. Federally, the numbers will be around 6,000 cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If federal unfair dismissal applications are down 52 per cent, we should ask the government, `What were you trying to achieve when you put in your new laws? Surely, this would be a target that you would find acceptable to yourselves.' If I said to somebody that the result of my law was that I could grow something by 52 per cent or decrease something by 52 per cent, I would be immensely proud of the achievement. But my belief is that the federal unfair dismissal applications being down 52 per cent is a massive recognition of the success and the applicability of those laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we come to what is, for me, the real killer. To find out what lies underneath the assertion that unfair dismissals impede job growth and are, in fact, unfair to small business, we have attempted&mdash;and I have attempted&mdash;for over a year now to discover what the real statistical situation is. When I began my remarks I commented that the government has indulged in statistical subterfuge. I think that is so. It chose a number&mdash;15 employees&mdash;below which this exemption will apply; yet the ABS number is 20. The consequence is that it is virtually impossible for the committee or any interest group, either on the employer or the employee side, or for the Senate, to establish the real number of small businesses that will be affected and the real number of employees who will be affected. That is why we are forced to rely on assumptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is much more to it than that. The industrial registries within the Industrial Relations Commission and in the Federal Court do not record the size of the businesses 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that come before them. So it is very natural to say to the government, `If the intention is just to exempt small businesses below the number of 15 employees, could you please let us know how many of those small businesses there actually are?' They say, `Oh no, we can't afford to do that; we don't have the time and the resources to do that.' Why? Because you do not want the truth to come out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very plain to us that you have attempted to conceal the fact that the majority of unfair dismissal applications are against big business, not small business. This bill of yours is a stalking horse for big business. It is an attempt to do away with a minimum protection which is available for workers who might otherwise be sacked unfairly. Anyone in the Senate who, at some stage in their life, has been either the victim or the potential victim of someone with supreme power over you, because you need the job and you have to take what they give you, will know how utterly unfair it is if you do not have recourse to some means of complaint, if it is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How many people are going to complain under the federal unfair dismissal laws this year? The estimate is 6,700. Why do we want to punish 6,700 people in this giant country of ours? It does not affect small business primarily; it affects big business, so it is just a furphy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look deeper into the statistics we discover that the 52 per cent of reductions in unfair dismissals are drastically reduced when you lump federal, state and territory jurisdictions together. Where employees have a chance to come under either the federal law or the state law, they will use whichever jurisdiction is better for them. They go to the state jurisdiction in a number of states. The consequence is that the overall decrease&mdash;when you add together state, territory and federal decreases&mdash;is about 27 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to then ask: what would happen if you took the states out of the equation? In Victoria, the ACT and the Northern Territory, the decline in unfair dismissal applications where only one jurisdiction applies, which is the federal jurisdiction, is one&hyphen;third. I will say to you that a one&hyphen;third reduction is an  enormous achievement if that was the govern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7737"> ment's intention in introducing the unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the states you find that New South Wales is down only 18 per cent; South Australia has not moved but is the same; WA is down 24 per cent; and Tasmania has increased by 12 per cent. I say to the coalition, if there is an unfair dismissal applications problem which is being expressed in surveys&mdash;which, by the way, do not express the difference between federal and state laws&mdash;it is in the states. Yet you want to introduce a federal law change which discriminates unfairly against workers because there is a states problem. So this is exposed once again as a cruel, heartless and immensely political exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next point we need to make is that our laws require that we do not discriminate against people unfairly. It has been a basic principle of justice from the time of Moses that people are equal before the law. How can you have a law which applies to three&hyphen;quarters of employees and not to one&hyphen;quarter? How can you allow the most weak and vulnerable sector in our employment spectrum not to have the protection of law against harsh, unjust or unfair dismissal?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am dismayed that this government would even conceive of a breach of such a fundamental principle. Let me repeat that you can only breach fundamental principles like that if the public good far exceeds the public evil that you have done by it. It does not in this case. You will not deliver more jobs as a result of your bill. You will not improve the lot of employers as a result of this bill. You will not improve the lot of employees as a result of this bill. You certainly will not do anything about the state laws, which is where the real problem resides. That is the coalition perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the Labor perspective, they say that there is no problem in that regard. By and large, I think Labor's view is that the state jurisdictions look pretty fair to them. I would expect that that would be Labor's view in South Australia and New South Wales. I do not know how they feel about Western Australia, Queensland and the other states, but I am sure they will speak for themselves and let 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> me know how they feel about those. I would expect that that would be the argument from an opposition perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am deeply concerned that the coalition should see fit to put employees at risk and should see fit to be prepared to sack workers unfairly. Some 1.6 million workers could potentially be sacked unfairly because you want a double&hyphen; dissolution trigger. I expect the Senate to reject this bill. I expect in the House of Representatives that you will come bustling back and say, `We want our way.' The Senate must, in my view, reject this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will continue to argue and expose your perfidy in terms of the facts and the statistics. You are not going to get away with it. We will find out what is in those industrial registers. We will find out the facts. We will let the nation know that you have lied, that you have said that this is about small business when it is about large business and that you said that you had an agreement with the Australian Democrats when you broke that agreement with me. I did not agree at any time, my former leader did not agree at any time, the Australian Democrats did not agree at any time to allow workers to be sacked unfairly. We will never agree to that whichever party is in power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is just not right. It is not appropriate. It does not deliver jobs. It is not good justice. It is not factually supported. It has no basis in economics, in social and judicial policy and in any other area. It is founded entirely on the hard and nasty rocks of political expediency. I dislike it intensely for that reason. I am deeply distressed that a minister of the seniority, experience, background and understanding of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business should be the proponent and supporter of such a bill. I therefore advise that I will be moving to reject the bill on the second reading. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me start by highlighting the ultimate impact of this legislation. That is that one&hyphen;third of all workers will have no right to protection against unfair, unjust or unreasonable dismissal. This is not just an exemption. An exemption usually implies a reasonably 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7738"> small number of people with usually good grounds to apply for differential treatment. The ultimate impact of this legislation would be that one&hyphen;third of all Australian workers would have no right to protection. Let us not delude ourselves on that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far, we have heard about the suspect motivation and about the fact that there is no case. I think Senator Murray could have said that there was no this, that or the other about 15 times if we went through all of the various issues. For a brief moment, before I go to the issue of how there is no case for this legislation, I will pause on the opportunities it provides us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Being the optimist that I am, I can usually find one or two positives in any situation. I think this legislation provides us with the opportunity to point out the real agenda of this government in workplace relations. This legislation highlights that their real agenda does go too far. It is not about a fair go all round because there is no fair go in this legislation for workers in small businesses&mdash;that one&hyphen;third of the Australian work force. It is not about a fair go all round because it focuses on the most vulnerable of workers as its victims, those who are least likely to have any form of representation in their workplaces to advance their interests. It is, as Senator Murray has pointed out, motivated on political grounds but it gives us the opportunity to highlight, as I have said, the government's real agenda in workplace relations and how it really sees Australian workers as politically expedient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also gives us the opportunity to highlight the role of Australian trade unions. Despite the fact that this legislation will concentrate on the higher proportion of workers who are not represented by trade unions, the union movement has been solid in its opposition. In doing so it has highlighted the role it has played, through Australian history, in representing Australian workers&mdash;not just union  members. The evidence before the committee was from unions involved in unfair dismissal cases&mdash;most often not representing  union members&mdash;and protecting the interests of workers who have taken a case to the Austral 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ian Industrial Relations Commission. That opportunity will be lost by this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other positive aspect from the point of view of the Australian Labor Party and perhaps from the Australian Democrats is that this legislation highlights the inconsistencies in the government's approach on this matter. The government is not really about harmonisation in industrial relations. There is no harmonisation in this action. This legislation will further complicate the field in relation to unfair dismissals. It will completely remove the rights of workers in some states such as Victoria, whereas in some other states workers in small businesses will have entitlements because they will have access to state jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, to follow on from Senator Murray's comments, let me move on to explain how the government has made no case at all. Whilst the government has moved fairly quickly in the Senate to bring on this legislation, particularly given that the committee report was only tabled yesterday evening, we have been pursuing this issue for quite some time through the estimates process and the committee process. We have been asking time and time again: where is some evidence to support this case? In some ways it has been a moving feast because some of the evidence given to us in the estimates committees has then disappeared a bit later when we have discredited it. The evidence has then been completely avoided when witnesses have provided arguments in the other direction once the logic of certain themes has been pointed out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look more closely at this lack of evidence. The material put before us from the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business is perhaps a good starting point. There are essentially two major themes to the argument put forward by the department's submission and, to give the department credit, over the last 12 months they have sought to substantiate the government's case. They have attempted to do that but, as I mentioned, the logic behind their arguments has been sorely lacking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The logic has been sorely lacking to the extent that in looking at the first theme, which is the actual need for this legislation and the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7739"> argument that it will remove some of the constraints to employment, the first stop is the Bell report, which unfortunately was misrepresented as an indicator that further change was needed. The Bell report was based on what I will continue to call the old legislation or the legislation before it was amended by the Workplace Relations Act. What the Bell report actually said was that there should be a review of the government's changes after 12 months. This legislation is certainly no review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had the Morgan and Banks report. Again, the data relied on in that report was the old legislation. Then we had a survey called Recruitment Solutions. That, too, was based on the old legislation. Ironically, when we asked why the Australian workplace industrial relations survey 1995 was not included&mdash;a survey conducted by the department itself&mdash;the argument presented to us in the committee was that it was related to the old legislation. More to the point, the results of the department's own survey were not convenient in terms of the case it was struggling to put together for the government. The most comprehensive survey of such issues in Australia, including a whole chapter dealing with issues relevant to small businesses and actually mentioning in its survey unfair dismissals, was ignored. It was not included. The rationale was that it related to the old legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet, if you look at the data we have before us which does not relate to the old legislation, you will see that we are left with a survey by the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. That survey does not even provide us details of the nature of its population, so it is a bit difficult to assess its reliability. As Senator Mackay has already pointed out, once you have a look at what that survey is really saying, the rating at No. 11, after so many other factors, does not really say so much. I think it even rates the need for reform of unfair dismissal after the need for reform of a parliamentary nature. These are the concerns for Tasmanian small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other evidence referred to was just a bland statement coming out of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry review 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in 1997. That was not actually based on any data at all; it was a bland statement by the ACCI. At least in a statistical sense&mdash;I think Senator Murray talked about statistical subterfuge&mdash;I think there is a statistical absence more than subterfuge because when you look behind these bald claims you see that there is really nothing there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we move on to the claim that there was business support. This issue has been very amusing to follow because I can recall when small business was concerned about fair trading. A couple of small businesses said, `We are actually far more concerned about what is going to happen with fair trading than with unfair dismissal.' They obviously got whacked around the ears because one month later they then said, `No, we really are concerned about unfair dismissal; it is our biggest issue.' A few other small business organisations then got whacked around the ears because a stream of `We really are concerned about these issues' finally started coming in, but the motivation for them was a bit questionable, again, because there was very little data demonstrating that this was such a significant concern for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact I should correct myself: there is data. There is data from the 1995 Australian workplace survey, data that the department was familiar with but did not present in its report. After this glaring absence was pointed out, it would have been useful to have had from the department a more objective assessment of the overall data, but that did not come in any of the following material. In some ways I am starting to feel sorry for some of the departmental officials because the role of an official in the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business seems to be changing with the change of government and it seems to be getting worse as time goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should go to the other surveys which I think have highlighted a contrary position to that that has been presented by the department&mdash;however willingly or unwillingly&mdash;and those are the Yellow Pages surveys,  independent surveys of small businesses and their concerns. Nowhere in those surveys is it highlighted that unfair dismissal is the signifi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7740"> cant concern that the government should be acting on to this extent at this time. Rather, their real concerns were the lack of business, the lack of business confidence and their lack of confidence, I would claim, in this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that was put forward by the department of industrial relations was that unfair dismissal laws had a differential impact on small businesses and, therefore, should get differential treatment. In the Australian sense, we came up with three examples of how that principle was applied. The first was in relation to TCR provisions; the provision of severance pay; and, in the New South Wales act, provisions in relation to notification of redundancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not pointed out there, as Senator Murray pointed out very well in the summary he put in his report, that the changes that have already been made to the act in part deal with some of these issues. The commission is now empowered to take into account an employer's viability in an assessment of damages. That being the case, then the nature of the business and its economic circumstances can be taken into account if that is the factor that is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other examples were the affirmative action legislation and payroll tax. Payroll tax actually gives small business an advantage by being exempted. The comparison to unfair dismissal is extraordinarily tenuous. But let us look at affirmative action. I think that is quite a good example because, when we introduced the affirmative action legislation, the threshold was 1,000 employees, and that was reduced over time. That is usually the principle you apply with such exemptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you are introducing a new entitlement or a new provision, in some circumstances you might say, `Well all right, we'll start with those that will find it easiest to implement these sorts of provisions, so we will start with the larger businesses.' Then, over time, you reduce the threshold. That was what was in fact done in relation to severance pay provisions in many different jurisdictions too. The commissions have decided over time that that sort of threshold is no longer justifiable. I do not know of an area where a thres 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hold has been introduced rather than reduced, and that is what this government is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The department also gave us some examples of international exemptions. I think that they are very interesting. They are very interesting because, as Senator Murray pointed out, why 15? He thought that it might have been statistical subterfuge to use the figure 15 but, on looking at the international examples, I think I have now worked out why the government is using 15. Maybe it is not so much because it is a threshold of TCR, but 15 is the worst international example. It is the worst, and it applies in Sri Lanka.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other examples, just to highlight this point, are Austria, where it is five; France, where it is 11; and Germany, where it is 10. In relation to Great Britain, it seems to be established on legal precedence not necessarily related to the exact number but does allow some exemptions. Italy tended to give more protection to these employees over time, which again, as I say, is usually the principle on exemptions&mdash;over time you tend to give more protection, not remove protection, which is what this bill is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from Italy, we had the Republic of Korea which is four or less. Can someone please tell me why in Korea they can introduce a standard of four or less whereas in Australia we have to bring in one for 15? Then we have, as I said, Sri Lanka at 15, and that is it. That is the extent of the examples. No wonder we are facing attacks on our international reputation. No wonder, when this is the environment we are operating in in the international climate. There is no way our officials representing Australia diplomatically can justify this sort of conduct, no way at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to move on to the only other area where the committee received evidence, attempting to demonstrate a case, and I think that this example really highlights the lack of any case. I refer to the submission by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. If this was not such an important issue, their submission would have been comical. I did not laugh at the time, and I will not laugh now, but the ACCI submission to the Senate inquiry on this matter was&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7741">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GB6">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, if it had not been so serious, it was quite laughable. The ACCI had the audacity to say we need this legislation because of the legacy of the old legislation. It had the audacity to make that claim. On the same day it gave its evidence to the Senate, prior to giving evidence it released a report talking about costs of up to $36,500 associated with an unfair dismissal claim for small business based on a comparison with an unfair dismissal claim and that of a claim which would go all the way up to an arbitrated hearing in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission with respect to sexual harassment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comparison between an unfair dismissal case and sexual harassment is beyond me, but the actual example also was that of a case dealt with by a large business, not a small business. It involved all of the different stages within a large business. You had the human resource manager, the line manager, the legal advice and the legal fees; and you had interviews with both the claimant and the respondent. I would love to know who the respondent actually is in this process when it is an unfair dismissal case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You had counselling. Certainly, counselling is quite appropriate in relation to a sexual harassment case and the ongoing employment relations within an enterprise, but how it pertains to a worker who has been sacked is well and truly beyond me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another beautiful example in this report is how the publication of leaflets, brochures, et cetera for distribution within the work environment relate to an unfair dismissal case when the worker has already been sacked; they are not even in the work force. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry was the only representative of Australian business at that point to put evidence before this committee. They essentially based their submission upon that argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That argument was a fairly strong attempt at scaremongering; it attempted to draw out the line that this government ran during the last election that unfair dismissal was killing small business. That argument lacked credibility then and it lacks credibility now. This 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legislation highlights that lack of credibility. It is also highlighted in the step that Mr Reith has taken beyond his original attempt with the regulations to wipe the slate. That is how Peter Reith treats employees in small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to highlight some problems with the majority report. Senator Murray made the point quite clearly when he said that the report actually damns the government's case. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make some comments in this debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R245">Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . The appropriate place to commence is by referring to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996. That amending act that was proclaimed to apply from 1 January this year is relatively straightforward in its application. It outlines certain grounds in which an employer must not terminate an employee's employment. Essentially, it says that employers must not dismiss an employee for reasons not connected with either the performance of the employee or the organisational requirements of the enterprise, and that reason must not be harsh, unjust or unreasonable. As it currently applies, the act applies equally to all employees regardless of their award status.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of observations should be made about the current act before we discuss the amending bill. Firstly, it applies to all employees regardless of their award status. Hence, it does not discriminate between workers, genders or the size of the business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, and quite importantly, it has a conceptual underpinning quite consistent with traditional Australian ethos. Essentially it says that if you perform the work required by your employer, the law will not permit that employer to behave in an arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory fashion by terminating your employment. It means that work is important and that continued employment is valued. It means that so important is the nature of work that the statute law overrules the common law, firstly, by restricting the right of employers to dismiss employees and, secondly, by saying that any dismissal shall not be discriminatory or unfair.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7742">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the act provides all employees with the opportunity for an independent tribunal to review what that employee might believe to be an unfair dismissal. Again, it is with the provision that the current act reinforces the notion of equality before the law, and adds a significant degree of egalitarianism in practice by saying that all employees can avail themselves of taxpayer funded, state supported conciliation and, if necessary, arbitration of potentially unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, by any stretch of the imagination, it can be said that from the government's point of view the provisions of the current act have been greatly successful. The current act has been in place for only nine months. Table 1 of the majority report discloses that the number of applications lodged with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on an annualised basis have fallen from 14,028 in 1996 to 6,700 in 1997. In 1996 there were 14,028 applications and this year the number of applications to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission seeking reinstatement has decreased to 6,700. That is a huge drop in the number of persons seeking to test a dismissal by an employer in the Industrial Relations Commission. In excess of 7,300 fewer cases are the subject of application to the Industrial Relations Commission during the same period in the years 1996 and 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, we know that fewer employees are using the current act. Consequently, we can accurately conclude that very few small businesses are in any way affected by the current provisions of the act. It follows logically that a maximum of 6,700 of the 353,000 small businesses in Australia that actually employ labour will derive any benefit from the proposed amending bill. In stark terms, .018 per cent of all small businesses in Australia that employ people stand to enjoy any impact, let alone gain any advantage, if this bill is passed. That is, 99.98 per cent of all small businesses in Australia that employ persons are not affected by the current act, and will not be affected by the amending bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, in my own state of Western Australia, fewer than 600 small businesses employing people have been affected by the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> act. One large shopping centre the size of Booragoon or Morley has more than 600 firms employing labour. That is how small, minor and insignificant the impact of the bill will be if it is passed by the Senate. With that background and understanding of the current act, I will now turn to the amending bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill, as stated in the majority report, will have this effect. Any employee who is first engaged by the relevant employer after the commencement of the bill will not be able to make an application on the ground that the termination of his or her employment was harsh, unjust or unreasonable where he or she was employed by an employer who employs fewer than 15 employees. Put simply, new employees of an employer employing fewer than 15 workers cannot use the unfair dismissal provisions. So the amending bill discriminates, firstly, between existing and future employees, secondly, between firms employing more than 15 employees and fewer than 15 employees in the future and, thirdly, different sizes of employers who regard themselves as coming within that category of small business, however defined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the report of the government senators, the arguments in favour of this discriminatory approach to employees essentially boil down to two: small business needs protection from oppressive industrial relations legislation and the bill, if passed, will aid employment growth. Let us look now at each of these arguments in turn and put on the public record some of the evidence presented to the committee. We know the following from submissions provided by the departments and latterly from responses to supplementary questions put in writing to relevant officers of the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, there are 780,000 small businesses in Australia. Secondly, there are 353,000 small businesses in Australia which employ labour. Thirdly, in the period 31 December 1996 to 12 September 1997 there were 4,800 applications made to the Industrial Relations Commission. Those 4,800 applications included all businesses, large, medium and small. Fourthly, of those 4,800 applications, 2,807 in total were settled prior to arbitration. Almost 60 per cent&mdash;the exact figure being 58.46 per 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7743"> cent&mdash;of all applications to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission were settled prior to arbitration. The figure of 2,807 comprises the following: 121 were finalised for a preliminary reason; 679 were withdrawn or discontinued; 1,663 were settled by conciliation; and 344 were settled after conciliation but prior to arbitration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, of the 4,800 applications, 2,807, or almost 60 per cent, were settled in a one&hyphen; or two&hyphen;hour conference engaged in before a conciliation commissioner. A further 1,675 are still awaiting conciliation. Of the 4,800 applications, the lousy figure of 56 matters were resolved by arbitration and another 239 are awaiting arbitration some time in the future. The question arises: what statistical conclusion can be drawn from this evidence provided in table 4 in response to supplementary questions asked by me in writing to the department?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the 350,000&hyphen;odd small businesses employing labour in Australia, a maximum of 295 businesses of all types have been affected by an arbitral case or pending arbitral case. So, by lifting this terrible burden that is currently imposed on small business, a maximum of 300 firms of all sizes around Australia will avoid a day or days in court appearing in an arbitral matter before an industrial commissioner. So it is fair then to draw the following conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current act has an absolutely minimal impact on business generally and on small business in particular in this country. The amending bill will have zero impact on small business because so few small businesses have been the subject of a claim for unfair dismissal. The current numbers of applications to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will continue at the same rate or, at best, will decline marginally. There will be limited future impact in the marketplace because the amending bill applies only to future employers and in firms employing fewer than 15 employees. So when this lengthy process, which has evolved over the last 18 months, is presented in the parliament by agreement between some of the parties in this chamber, disallowance motions and Senate inquiries into the current legislation are all about the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> impact on 300 firms across the entirety of Australia. If that helps small business generally in any way, then I will be amazed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we should not rely purely on what the statistics reveal or on the evidence disclosed by witnesses or the material supplied by the department. Let us turn to the minority report tabled by opposition senators. Let us examine the evidence that goes to the central issue in this debate; that is, the assertion that unfair dismissal laws deter small businesses from taking on new staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know there were some interesting responses to the Australian workplace industrial relations survey of 1995. That survey asked a range of business enterprises, `Why haven't you recruited any employees?' The answer was predictable: 68 per cent of businesses do not need them. For 33 per cent, it was a lack of work, lack of demand for product and a lack of profitability in their own enterprise. Six per cent said that high employment costs were a factor in not hiring labour. But no persons&mdash;not one business enterprise which answered that survey&mdash;said that unfair dismissal laws were a reason for not employing labour. More importantly, in answer to the specific question, `Why haven't you recruited more employees?' as opposed to, `Why don't you hire any employees?', only six per cent again said high employment costs. None mentioned unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further surveys tabled before the committee, or provided to the committee in response to questions after the committee concluded its public hearings, gave a similar result. I refer to the May 1997 Yellow Pages small business survey, the August 1997 Yellow Pages small business survey, the Morgan and Banks job index and the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry survey referred to by other senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Yellow Pages small business survey specifically asked small business employers what they believed the barriers were to investment expenditure. The leading responses were: lack of cash flow, 32 per cent; lack of work, 23 per cent; profitability, 19 per cent; the economic climate, 19 per cent; and lack of confidence in the future, four per cent. Clearly, as the report says, all of these re 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7744"> sponses are associated with demand factors operating upon individual firms&mdash;that is, insufficient demand for the products that they offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only employment factor mentioned was the general response: cost of employing, three per cent. Even assuming that this response includes alleged disincentives provided by the unfair dismissal laws, this can be only a fraction of the three per cent. We can safely conclude that the survey effectively shows that, as of four months ago&mdash;May 1997&mdash;small business did not regard the unfair dismissal laws as a barrier to investment or as a disincentive to employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the survey specifically asked small business people what problems, if any, they were facing at the moment. Not one small business enterprise replied, `Unfair dismissal laws impact on our business, are of concern to our business, prevent us from hiring any labour or additional labour.' Not one respondent advised that survey, which was commissioned by the relevant department, that unfair dismissal laws impacted upon them in any way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the August 1997 small business survey, now only two months old, exposes the reality that small business does not believe that unfair dismissal laws are a disincentive to employment. They were again asked what the barriers were to taking on new employees. Lack of work was the overwhelming response, with 42 per cent. Other factors were: the cost of employing, 18 per cent; superannuation costs, 11 per cent; employment conditions, 11 per cent;  economic climate, nine per cent; and lack of cash flow, eight per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The results from the August and the May surveys are the same. Lack of demand factors prevent firms from selling their product in the marketplace to consumers, and that lack of exchange is the reason why they do not hire any or additional labour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second specific question asked, unprompted, in the survey was: what should the government be addressing most urgently? What should the government be doing to aid our enterprises to grow and to expand? What did they say? Unfair dismissal laws was the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> response of just three per cent of small business. Other issues were: tax reform, 10 per cent; unemployment, six per cent; red tape, five per cent; lower taxes and a whole range of other matters. Unfair dismissal laws was at the bottom of the answers and it affected only three per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Morgan and Banks job index result was similar. In evidence, the department failed to refer to the fact that this survey shows that almost 80 per cent of small businesses were not affected by the unfair dismissal laws in their decisions to hire new staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry surveyed firms to determine where businesses ranked unfair dismissal laws. The answer&mdash;not surprisingly&mdash;was that it rated No. 11 in a field of 58 business issues in terms of their priorities. The other 10 issues were: lack of tax reform, lack of population growth, lack of demand, workers compensation, legislation, federal taxation charges, complexity of regulations, employee oncosts, current state parliamentary systems and government regulation. At No. 11, towards the bottom of the list, was unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The surveys relied upon have generally not supported the government's position in bringing this bill before the Senate. What conclusions can be drawn in summary form from those surveys? That question can only be answered in the context of previous statistical information which showed absolutely no impact on 99.8 per cent of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conclusions are threefold. Firstly, almost all small business puts a range of other factors&mdash;cash flow, profitability, market access, demand factors, unfair competition, red tape&mdash;as the principal reasons for declining to hire any or additional labour. Secondly, if prompted&mdash;and only if prompted&mdash;about six per cent of small business mentioned higher labour costs, which may or may not mean the impact of unfair dismissal laws. Thirdly, it is fair to conclude that the government is not helping small business by attacking a non&hyphen;existent problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the problem does not exist, if it does not impact on business generally, if it does not impact upon small business in particular 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7745"> across the breadth of our land, one must ask the question: what is the benefit to be gained to those enterprises when the government puts this bill before the parliament? The answer is simple: no benefit; no help for the future; no assistance in the present; and no change in the business environment in which those firms operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the opposition advances four reasons why it opposes this bill. Firstly, the exemption is unfair to employees. It is inherently unfair to have no right of relief from harsh action by employers. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate to speak against the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R245">Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . I believe this bill is nothing more than a mere put-up job by the government to create an impression that it is doing something for small business. Of course, it is basically another broken promise of this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to focus on a number of issues this afternoon but, in particular, I want to look at the issue of why the government has selected 15 as the cut-off point&mdash;below which the people will not have recourse to the unfair dismissal law. It is interesting that, when one looks at the Australian Bureau of Statistics' definition of small business, the limit is set at 20. Yet I understand that in other parts of the world where similar legislation applies the figure is infinitely lower than 15.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why has this government chosen 15? There is no rhyme or reason to it. There is no good sense to what they have done, apart from the fact that the legislation itself denies people fundamental and basic rights. There are many small businesses which can be rather substantial with 15 employees. So, whilst we are talking about the term `small business', one need not necessarily be of the view that it is something that is not inconsequential in terms of turnover, profitability and return to those who run the small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So setting it at the level of 15 is of itself quite unrealistic. All this legislation sets out to do is to persecute those employees who choose to work in those small businesses and to favour the employers quite unfairly. What we see is that the size of a business or its turnover should not be the determining factor 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for any matter such as this. Quite frankly, I believe that what the government is doing is quite draconian. So there should be no determining factor whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one looks at the issue of the number 15, one sees that the government, by setting a limit such as that, has in effect set a deterrent to that small business expanding their employment. Obviously, if an employer has 15 employees, the last thing that they are going to do is employ any more employees and thereby take themselves outside the range of this particular piece of legislation and their access to an almost unfettered right to sack their employees without any recourse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the number 15 really has no rhyme, reason or sense to it. It really acts as nothing more than a deterrent. Of course, there is nothing to say that, having settled at 15 on this occasion, at some stage in the future the government could not change the number to 20, 25, 50 or whatever number they may choose, so long as it satisfies their constituency out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt in my mind that this particular piece of legislation will do nothing more than encourage worst practice because it will destroy the legal rights of the worker for reinstatement on the ground of unfair dismissal. Employers able to access this provision will, in effect, have a field day out there in the workplace, because it will put in place a timid, subservient work force who will have to cop whatever is dished out to them by their employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is not going to encourage best practice; it is going to encourage worst practice. Of course, the employee, having been placed in a subservient role with no real recourse, will take whatever comes their way. Shoddy work practices are the last thing that we need in this nation. The employees will be told, `Don't complain. You've got a job. Be grateful. Be thankful.' The employee, regardless of the circumstances, will have to take that fairly and squarely on the chin. This government is about taking standards down rather than raising them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if this legislation is passed and if an employer has 16 employees, you could imagine what the employer will do. An employer 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7746"> may well now have 18 or 20 employees today and maybe with natural attrition the number will fall to 16. What will the employer do at some stage in the future? The magical number 15 is not too far off. That additional person does not even have to be sacked. That person can leave by their own accord and thereby change the status of the employer from being one not covered by the legislation to being one covered by the legislation that the government proposes. Therefore, they will be able to take advantage of this law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the limit in itself is really quite an inane proposition. It is something that really makes a joke of the proposed legislation and shows what a sop this is by the government to the small business constituency out there&mdash;many of whom have lost faith in this government because it has abandoned them anyway. So what we have before us defies logic. Why 15? It defies and ignores the fundamental rights of people out there in the workplace who currently have access to unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unfair dismissal laws, as I have said, have not in the last 12 months worked adversely against the interests of small business. I think it was conceded that there needed to be certain revisions made in that area and those have been made. Ever since, small businesses have not been concerned about the unfair dismissal laws. So what we find, basically, as I have said already, is that we are now in the middle of a political stunt. Of course, this stunt fundamentally takes away the rights of the average worker when one considers the vast array of small businesses that operate in the workplace in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing the legislation does is destroys any concept of balance in the employment relationship. It tilts the balance in favour of the employer decidedly. That is an unhealthy situation. The people who are going to be invariably most affected by this imbalance are women and young employees, the people who invariably find themselves in the employer-employee relationship very much disadvantaged without having another hurdle, another obstacle, put in their path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to spend a few moments looking at the report brought down by the Senate Eco 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nomics Legislation Committee on this matter because about three or four pages of this report tell the story of what this is about. If one looks at page 21 of the report, one sees that the justification as to why the government claims this legislation is necessary is fully exposed. At page 21 it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . statistics from the 1995/96 Industrial Relations Court Annual Report show that&mdash;as stated by the then Chief Justice Murray Wilcox&mdash;perhaps contrary to popular misconception, small business has fewer unfair dismissal claims than other employers: only a third of [unfair dismissal claims] is from the small business sector notwithstanding that 91.7% of employers have fewer than 20 employees.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is really getting to the nub of what this debate is about. The statistics just do not support the government's contention. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . those same statistics show that in any event the actual rate of unfair dismissal claims is very low. Again contrary to popular opinion which would suggest that everyone dismissed rushes off and files an unfair dismissal claim, the statistics show: the unfair dismissal filing rate was slightly under 2% of all monthly involuntary terminations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If this were not in the minority report, it would not be out there in the public domain and the public would be unaware of what this debate really is about. It is not about a giant rush by people who work in small business going off and filing an unfair dismissal claim. There are very limited numbers of claims. The minority report at page 21 goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . even under the old unfair dismissal laws prior to amendment, for every 100 workers dismissed in Australia less than 2 even lodged an unfair dismissal claim.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So where is the problem? It is a problem that has been manufactured. The report goes on to a third conclusion and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as a result of the amendments the Government made to the unfair dismissal laws, we can be sure that this figure is now even lower. With a decrease in the number of federal unfair dismissal applications of over 50%, we know that only 1 in 100 dismissals is now challenged by a federal unfair dismissal claim.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So again it just shows that the government have beat this up as much as they can. The authors of the minority report&mdash;my colleagues 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7747"> Senator Jacinta Collins and Senator Bishop&mdash;then go on to a conclusion which is important. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we can conclude on the basis of these statistics that less than 1 in every 100 involuntary dismissals in small business are now affected by federal unfair dismissal claims.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They also make the comment&mdash;it is not highlighted but it really sums it up:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This extraordinary statistic really does lead us to raise the obvious question&mdash;where is the overwhelming problem that needs such a drastic solution?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That really is what the government have got to show, and I do not believe they can. Further on at page 22 of the minority report is another interesting conclusion drawn by my colleagues. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . on the basis of these statistics we can conclude that in the 9 months since the Government's unfair dismissal laws came into operation:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">- 0.005% (or 1 in every 20,000) employing small businesses have been affected by a federal unfair dismissal claim that concluded with an arbitration hearing;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">- 0.4% (or 1 in every 250) employing small businesses have even been affected by a federal unfair dismissal claim.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One could hardly say that that is a torrent of unfair claims against small business or something that small business should not be able to cope with, given that  we are dealing with the fundamental basic rights of workers to protect themselves against harsh and unconscionable treatment that employers can hand out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The other thing that I just wanted to look at very briefly is the claim made on page 7 of the majority report&mdash;it is the report of the chairman, Senator Ferguson, but it reflects the government's contention. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employees will continue to have a remedy in relation to unfair dismissal within the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Workplace Relations Act 1996</EMPHASIS>  . . . This section&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">referring to the current legislation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">removes the employees ability to apply to the Commission on grounds of unfair dismissal.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the government acknowledges that it does that. Then the report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislation is still in place providing the employee with rights in relation to fair employment and if required fair dismissal. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a brazen statement which is challenged quite fairly by Senator Bishop and Senator Collins at page 34 of the report. I think that issue is addressed very succinctly by the statement:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We note in passing that the Government has on a number of occasions sought to argue that small business employees will still have a right to relief based on the unlawful termination provisions, especially the prohibition against discrimination. This is true, but those laws do not provide relief where the termination is not discriminatory, but is harsh unjust or unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">An example of this significant distinction is the following: while the anti-discrimination provisions protect a woman from being dismissed because she is a woman, they do NOT protect a woman from being dismissed because she refused the employer's direction to break the law.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Whilst the government may express some better motive at page 7 of this report, it is quite clear that, for all their words, that does not offer the employee the protection that they now have against harsh, unjust and unconscionable acts on the part of the employer. The whole thrust of what the government is doing will be simply to take away rights of the employee and to make those employees subservient and subjugated to the desire and the wish of the employer. My concern in this is that many of these employees will be women and young people, and they are the people that we should be doing our utmost to protect at the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In conclusion, the legislation is undoubtedly a sop to the small business community. It does remove a current legal response available to workers. In my view, it strengthens inordinately the power of the employer&mdash;not that the employer-employee relationship is ever equal, but this makes the relationship so one-sided that it does not count. The legislation will adversely affect women and young people. I do not believe that this legislation, if passed, will create one job out there in the small business community. It is not a job creation measure. That should be clearly remembered when this bill is being considered. What is at issue here is the dignity of the worker, and the bill should be rejected.</PARA></SPEECH>

This is true, but those laws do not provide relief where the termination is not discriminatory but is harsh, unjust or unreasonable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Heffernan said, it is like the rain&mdash;you are always wondering whether you are going to ruin or going on to become a wealthy farmer. But there is no doubt that there are lots of problems faced by small business. For example, you cannot afford to get sick; you have to worry about where your rent comes from, where your wages come from, whether you can make a reasonable living and so on. There are all sorts of pressures on small business. As a parliament we should do all we can to see that small business gets as good a go as is possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my belief&mdash;and I think people in this chamber would endorse it&mdash;that small business is also ethical. It goes about its delivery of services and supply of goods in a way that is moral and proper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explanatory memorandum published by the government explains the  Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997  and it is important to highlight:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ABS unpublished data for February 1995 indicates that there were 1,921,000 non&hyphen;farm private sector wage and salary earners employed by a firm of less than 15 employees (37% of all non&hyphen;farm private sector wage and salary earners). ABS data for February 1996 indicates that 23.5% of all persons working then had a duration in their current job of less than one year.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So small business is essential not only for the supply of goods and services but also for the state of employment in Australia&mdash;the more small business employs people, the better things are for the country. All that should be put on the record as we debate this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does it follow from the fact that small business is essential and that, to succeed, people who run small business have to show imagination, judgment, skill, energy, commitment and courage&mdash;and they need to show them in great measure&mdash;that this bill should become law? In other words, small business should be exempt from the law that applies to all other employers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7750">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that this law does apply to all other employers indicates that it is a law that is fair and reasonable. In other words, the fact that it is proposed that small business be exempt indicates that the law, generally, protecting people's jobs and protecting people from unfair dismissal, is a fair and reasonable proposition. If it were not, this legislation should be aimed at not simply exempting small business from complying with it but exempting all business from complying with it. If it is an unreasonable proposition that there ought to be unfair dismissal laws available to employees, it should be generally taken away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposition is: should there be special exemption for small business? Since the general proposition is that there ought to be laws relating to unfair dismissals for people, businesses and employers generally, that proposition means that the onus is on those proposing to exempt small business to show that small business should be exempt. That has not been made out. I say that because, if it were to be made out, it would have been made out in the second reading speech, which was written to support this proposition, and it does not do that. If I go through the second reading speech, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is intended to ensure that small businesses are exempted from the federal unfair dismissal provisions, in respect of new employees. This exemption is necessary and appropriate, given the special features of small business&mdash;and it is necessary, to ensure continuing growth in employment in small business.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a categorical statement, but there is no evidence put forward in the second reading speech to support that proposition. Indeed, if you look at the paragraph I just read out, it is interesting that this bill is not to be retrospective. It is not to be retrospective because it would be unfair to make it retrospective; it would disadvantage people who have already been employed. It is an onerous thing to take away a person's ability to bring an action for wrongful dismissal. If that is so, it means that new employees&mdash;when I talk about new employees, I mean those people employed from now on&mdash;are subject to an onerous law. If it were not onerous, there would be no need to ensure that retrospectivity did not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> operate. Later on the second reading speech says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has, of course, already made substantial progress in labour market reform, which is and will be of particular benefit to small business.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, that is a statement that, as it were, floats in the air and has no argument to back it up. It simply goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996 has changed the federal industrial relations system, and the relationship between federal and state industrial relations systems, providing small business with greater opportunities to develop industrial relations arrangements best suited to their individual circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, that is a statement that is not backed up. Indeed, this idea of an equal bargaining position is a concept that has for long been known to be false. If I can resort to the words of the present Pope in his encyclical centesimus annus letter, he had this to say&mdash;and he is talking about Leo the 13th:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Pope immediately adds <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">another right</EMPHASIS>  which the worker has as a person. This is the right to a `just wage', which cannot be left to the `free consent of the parties, so that the employer, having paid what was agreed upon, has done his part and seemingly is not called upon to do anything beyond'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What is being said there is that the free bargaining position is falsely named because it is not a free bargaining position; it is a position where the balance of power is all a particular way. That is a matter that was commented upon 90 years ago by Mr Justice Higgins of the High Court. On that occasion he was sitting as president of a tribunal which fixed fair wages and conditions. He had this to say when talking about remuneration:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remuneration could safely have been left to the usual, but unequal, contest, the "higgling of the market" for labour, with the pressure for bread on one side, and the pressure for profits on the other. The standard of "fair and reasonable" must, therefore, be something else; and I cannot think of any other standard appropriate than the normal needs of the average employee, regarded as a human being living in a civilised community.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What is in the interests of the average employee who is regarded as a human being living in a civilised community? Should not a person who is unfairly dismissed have a claim against his or her employer, no matter 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7751"> the size of that employer? If I employed two or three people, can't I be as unjust and as unfair as a corporation that employs a thousand?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Calvert, thank you very much; nor would you. But if somebody unlike us with a small labour force did do something along those lines, should not that employee have the same right as any other employee in the community, particularly when, according to the explanatory memorandum to the bill, over 1,900,000 people were employed by small business in February 1995? No doubt that figure has gone up since then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a bill that is misconceived. Small business must be encouraged for all the reasons that I have put forward. But where is the evidence&mdash;and Senator Bishop, Senator Jacinta Collins, Senator Hogg and Senator Mackay have already gone into this&mdash;that supports the proposition that the exclusion of small business from the law that generally applies to others will give small business the fillip that is needed? The people running small business need to be able to let their initiative, their imagination and their ability to judge the market have full flow. They need to have the ability to meet the many costs that impinge upon them. They also need to have the ability to meet the various regulations that are imposed upon them. They need to be given the ability to sell quality products or deliver services in the best of ways to the community. That is the sort of thing that should be encouraged and should be looked at rather than saying, `Look, the solution to all the difficulties that small business has is an ability to hire and fire at will.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know, and this is the interesting thing, that a lot of other regulations and laws under the Workplace Relations Act will apply to small business. People have made the distinction that they are subject to the Workplace Agreements Act. All those provisions apply except, if this legislation is passed, the unfair dismissal provisions. It seems extraordinary that so much faith can be put on a proposition for which there is very little evidence. I will read the minister's second reading speech again, In 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> support of the proposition that I have just put, the minister's second reading speech says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exemption is from the federal unfair dismissal provisions only. Employees will still be protected by the Workplace Relations Act. Section 170CK protects employees against dismissal because of any discriminatory reason.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then it goes on. It is not that this legislation, as I have said, exempts small business from most of the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act, but this, as it were, is a sop thrown to small business by the government as a focus for what is seen as their discontent. The passage of this act will not make small business successful. This second reading speech does not pretend to give any justification for what is intended. I read again from it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And Madam President, this is the crucial point&mdash;this exemption is not just about removing a burden from small business, it is about the positive employment benefits of the expanded job opportunities that will surely result from the removal of that burden.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is no argument put. There are no figures quoted. There is no proposition from some learned professor put into this second reading speech. There is just the bald statement that is left to hang out as a justification for a very dramatic move&mdash;and this is a dramatic move&mdash;to remove this very crucial right of people who work for employers who employ 15 or fewer employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business must be encouraged. People who run small business have all sorts of pressures on them. But the proposition in this legislation that seeks to take away rights from certain employees&mdash;rights that all other employees have&mdash;is not the way forward. If this legislation is passed this parliament will not be facing up to the real issues that confront small business.</PARA></SPEECH>

He put a number of the arguments very succinctly, as have all of my colleagues. I think the absence of serious debate from the other side does not on this occasion reflect any pressure on the government to finish the legislative program but 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7752"> rather the government's lack of arguments in debating this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is clearly not a bill which they are able to support with any intellectual argument. It is very much about politics rather than industrial relations or making good law. I will come to that issue a little later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to start my contribution in this debate by declaring for those who like to make a big issue about this that I am a former union official and I have had some practical experience in unfair dismissal cases. While some people like to argue that that disqualifies you from such debates, I actually think it gives you some relevantexperience. I have had the experience of conducting unfair dismissal cases mainly in the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission but once or twice in the federal commission. It is very useful experience to bring to this debate. I must say that I won some and I lost some, but, hopefully, I learnt from that experience what law should be applied in such cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I bring to this debate is some experience in managing small offices&mdash;not a traditional small business. I, like Senator Cooney, have a great deal of sympathy for small business people who are struggling to hold their operations together and are confronted with employment issues, taxation issues and business confidence issues on a daily basis. It is a very difficult job and there are complex and difficult issues that confront them in the employment area. I am not at all unsympathetic to that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both as secretary of a union which employed three or four staff and as secretary of the Western Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party, which was a smaller small business when I finished than when I started as I had the responsibility for downsizing that organisation, I did learn something about the difficulties of running a small business. It was well after the heyday, Senator Alston, when money was aplenty in that organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do have some appreciation of the difficulties in managing the aspirations of staff, meeting the financial constraints of the organisation and trying to make sure that fairness is applied to employees in those situations. The reason I enter this debate is not so 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> much because of my experience, because I think my colleagues, particularly those on the committee and Senator Mackay and Senator Cooney, have really taken us through what is a compelling case against the bill, but rather because I am outraged at the underlying principle at the heart of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are being asked as a parliament not to offer protection to those employees who have been unfairly dismissed by an employer in a harsh, unjust or unreasonable way if they happen to be working for an employer who employs less than 15 people. We are being asked to put aside the principle we recently endorsed and that this parliament has endorsed throughout its history of providing protection to employees in such circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this occasion we are being asked to put aside the principle of providing protection for those who have been treated harshly, unjustly or unreasonably because they are employed by an employer who employs less than 15 people. That is the core principle at the heart of this bill. The government wants to make the case that, because an employer employs less than 15 people, the principle that we have accepted on the government's initiative as being a fair rule to apply to unfair dismissal in this country should be now set aside.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all of my experience, I have never come across the question of the number of employees who are employed by an employer being a central issue in an unfair dismissal case. I was involved in a whole range of different unfair dismissal cases, from nurses who were dismissed from hospitals to bar workers who were dismissed from small clubs and hotels. Never once when arguing the merits of the case or the principles involved did the issue of the number of other employees employed by the employer seem to be at the heart of the dispute. I do not remember it ever being raised by an employer as a justification of their position, as a defence for dismissing someone. We generally worked on the basis that, if you went to the Industrial Relations Commission, you had to come in with clean hands and we sought industrial fairness. In most cases that was meted out, even though 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7753"> on occasions I was on the wrong side of the argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been asked, in this parliament, to endorse discrimination against people on the basis of the number of fellow employees employed by their employer. It is a ludicrous proposition to put. It is straight discrimination against those persons who happen to work for an employer who employs less than 15 people. The principle that the government wishes to apply to unfair dismissal will not apply to an employment context where there are 16 people employed. It will not apply where there are 30 people. It will not apply where there are 100 people. It will apply where there are less than 15 people. There is no rationale, no justification, no argument advanced for this proposition that holds any water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worse than that. It is a principle the government says should not apply to existing employees. It will only apply to future employees. We will have a situation where two workers might be dismissed for the same offence, say, some activity on the job which the employer finds unreasonable. If you are employed before this act comes into operation you would have the right to pursue an unfair dismissal case. You could take your case to the Industrial Relations Commission. You could have it argued on its merits and if the employer had been harsh, unjust or unreasonable you could get your job back. If you were employed the day after this bill, if carried, was enacted&mdash;tough luck.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Different rules apply purely because of the date on which you were employed. There could be two employees sacked for the same offence and one would have the right to recourse and one would not. What is the principle in this? What on earth drives this sort of arrangement? There is no principle. There is no rationale. It is another case of discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, there could be two employees sacked from the same industry at around the same time for the same offence. One would have a right to challenge unfair dismissal if they were working for an employer with more than 15 employees; the other one, who could be working next door in a similar factory, shop, solicitor's office or whatever the busi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ness enterprise, would not have a right to challenge unfair dismissal if they were working for an employer with less than 15 employees. They could be sacked for exactly the same offence, but the determining factor for whether they could go to the Industrial Relations Commission and seek justice and a fair hearing is the number of fellow employees employed in the enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is absolutely ridiculous. There is no justice, no fairness, in that proposition. As I say, you are discriminating against different classes of employees for no particular reason. There is no defence for this. The government has not been prepared to try to argue the merits of those sorts of propositions. It has not been prepared to try to defend that sort of discrimination because there is no defence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What makes this even more ridiculous is that the government is seeking to amend its own legislation, the Workplace Relations Act, for which it only recently gained support in the Senate, might I say despite the opposition of opposition senators. It was heralded as a triumph for the coalition government&mdash;a new age of industrial relations. But, almost immediately following its passage, the government is seeking to amend it. Again, there is no rationale for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) beaming, holding hands and cavorting with my new party colleague Senator Kernot, celebrating this new legislation and how it represented a fair and just solution. But now it is apparently not good enough. There must be some reason for this change. It seems to me the onus is on the government to prove why we must amend the act that they triumphantly got through this parliament only recently. They must prove the case. They must establish the need, the rationale, and set out the principles that they think should apply. They have not done that. They cannot do that. There is no acceptable rationale, there is no principle at the basis of this, and there is no demonstrated need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleagues have already outlined the experience of business. They have put paid to the assertions that somehow this change is required by small business. This is a non 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7754"> sense. This is about politics, but I will come back to that in a second. I think it is really incumbent upon the government to prove their case as to why they want to amend their legislation, which they said was going to transform industrial relations in this country, so soon after its passage. In my view the parliament should reject the bill because the government has not made out a case for that change to happen. There is no rationale and there is no principle underlying this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do want to make one point which I think is important. The government claims that this bill is necessary to improve employment prospects for people in small business and that the furore regarding the previous Labor government's unfair dismissal laws has left an environment in which small business is unwilling to employ people because of the fear of possible unfair dismissal cases that may be taken against them. I think the government has failed to prove its case in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But an important element of this debate is that we had new industrial relations legislation put through by the coalition government which radically altered those unfair dismissal laws to make them far less onerous on small business. I do not want to argue the toss about the so-called Brereton laws, but the point is that those laws have gone. The government has had its way in terms of unfair dismissal and we are now operating under their new laws. So there is no impediment in that regard to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key argument, it seems to me, is the issue of job security. All the surveys, all the data put out by business and all the public opinion surveys illustrate the greatest problem facing the economy at the moment. It is not inflation, it is not interest rates; it is the issue of job security and resultant lack of confidence. Lack of confidence is stopping growth in the Australian economy. Retail spending is not growing as well as would be expected given the economic conditions. People are not prepared to spend money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason&mdash;widely understood, I think, in the Australian community&mdash;is the concern about job security. People are concerned 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about their jobs, concerned about their potential to hold their jobs or to find new jobs, and they are therefore reluctant to spend&mdash;reluctant to invest in homes, new cars and other retail purchases. What is the government going to do? The government is going to introduce a law that says, `If you work for an employer who has less than 15 employees you can be sacked tomorrow and it does not matter. You have no come back. You cannot go to the industrial umpire and argue your case. Even if it is harsh, unjust and unreasonable, you are out the door&mdash;stiff bickies, you're gone.' This is the government's initiative that they have introduced  into the equation that I described about job insecurity in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If anything, this bill will prevent the creation of employment in this community because it will do nothing to encourage those in jobs to spend. Insecurity and the unwillingness of people to expend money is holding back the economy. If people spent more, more jobs would be created as the economy and activity grew.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will do the exact opposite of what is claimed by the government. It will breed further job insecurity. People will not be willing to take on new jobs with small employers. They will be concerned about their prospects with small employers because they will have read the press that basically says, `If you work for an employer with 15 or less people you don't have any right to seek protection against unfair dismissal.' That will feed into the already existing job insecurity scenario that is so prevalent in Australia today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reject the claims that this bill will assist employment growth. In fact I assert that, if this bill is passed, it will lead to greater job insecurity, work against growth in the economy and therefore prevent the creation of the jobs needed to solve what is a growing unemployment problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to put one final argument. If people are listening to this debate they will be wondering: what is this all about? There is no principle involved. We have demonstrated that there is no demand from industry. The practical effect of this is relatively small in terms 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7755"> of the treatment of unfair dismissal cases in the Industrial Relations Commission. Why would the government be doing this? Quite frankly, at first I was a bit perplexed but the only answer I can come to is that the government is seriously looking for a double dissolution trigger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the history of this dispute, you will see that the government started off, passing its Workplace Relations Act. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) then announced in March this year that we would have new regulations which went to exclude employees from the protection of federal unfair dismissal laws who work for a small business with no more than 15 employees who had less than a year's continuous service. He said we were going to have a regulation that had those two aspects to it. Those regulations were disallowed by the Senate, as senators would be aware. In mid-July this year, the Prime Minister said he would be prepared to seek a double dissolution if the Senate failed to pass this bill which he introduced following the disallowance of those regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this bill goes further than those regulations proposed. The only criterion now included in terms of the exclusion from protection from unfair dismissal is this sole question of the 15 employees or less. The reference to their first year's continuous service went out the door. What we have seen is an upping of the ante. I think Mr Reith was asked by the Prime Minister to provide a double dissolution trigger so that the government could leave its options open in terms of a double dissolution election next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not one of those senators&mdash;and there are some in this place&mdash;who concentrates on these things and who speculates about when double dissolutions are going to be held and when there is going to be an election. I usually try to avoid that debate because I find it is a very circular argument. But I think it is the case that, on this occasion, Mr Reith, as Leader of the House, was asked to find a trigger. I think he thought, `If you want a job done, do it yourself. I'll make sure it's in my area. I'll go out and deliver for the government in terms of the trigger.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen is that the government progressively toughened their stance in terms of their proposals for unfair dismissal for small business. There is only one thing that can have driven that&mdash;they want to introduce a proposition that the Senate cannot accept, a proposition that the Democrats, the Greens, Labor and Senator Brian Harradine will not be able to accept. So they progressively made their proposition about small business unfair dismissal laws tougher as the year went on, despite their success in having their Workplace Relations Act carried.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It can be the only explanation for the government pursuing this bill. There is no basis in principle. There is no demonstrated need. There is no coherent rationale for this bill. All it can be is the politics. I think Mr Reith made that pretty clear in answer to a budget estimates question when he said that the decision to exempt small business from the federal unfair dismissal provisions was made by the government on a basis of `political judgment'. This bill is all about political judgment. It is not about industrial relations; it is not about providing proper, just unfair dismissal laws for the workers of Australia. I urge the Senate to reject the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all senators for their contributions. I have to confess that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7756"> I have not heard a great deal of the debate, but for Senator Evans's benefit, who thought that somehow this was unprecedented, could I remind him, if this has not already been pointed out, that in the Employment Protection Act 1982 in New South Wales which was introduced by the Wran government there was an exclusion for employers with fewer than 15 employees. These employers did not have to provide official notice of intention to terminate an employee's employment and  were not subject to severance pay orders under the act, and that is still the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986 introduced by the Hawke government there is an exclusion from its operation for employers with less than 100 employees. In the second reading speech, Mr Hawke acknowledged that small business did not have the capacity to undertake the full import of that legislation, so the act recognised the different circumstances of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I imagine that most of the arguments have been gone over quite thoroughly and exhaustively. I reiterate that small business does want and need an exemption from these provisions, not so they can dismiss unfairly but to relieve them from the threat of unfair dismissal proceedings. The defence of an unfair dismissal claim, however groundless, is especially burdensome for small businesses and the possibility of an unfair dismissal claim clearly does discourage many small businesses from taking on new employees. That is why an exception is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes have been welcomed by the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The exclusion will not lead to automatic and arbitrary sackings. Finding, rehiring and training staff costs money. Small businesses will not incur unnecessary costs by turning over employees without any reason. Employees will still be protected by the Workplace Relations Act. They will be protected against dismissal for discriminatory reasons. They will be protected against dismissal because of protected industrial action. They will be protected against dismissal involving victimisation or otherwise acting contrary to the principles of freedom of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> association. They will be protected against dismissal without notice or pay in lieu except in cases of serious misconduct. Also, apprentices who have a particular need for continuity of employment because of their training commitments will not be affected by this bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How often we are told that innovation and research and development are the key drivers of economic growth and how often it is repeated throughout the Industry Research and Development Board's annual report. Also, the government frequently reminds us of this fact. Boosting investment in industrial R&amp;D is crucial to ensuring sustainable growth, to lifting our export performance, to tackling unemployment and reversing the brain drain of our best and brightest academic and scientific talent. But what has the government done?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only last year the government effectively halved the value of the R&amp;D tax concession by reducing the maximum rate of deduction from 150 to 125 per cent in a move which was achieved in the Senate with the support of the coalition and the two Independent senators at that time. Yet this was and remains the IR&amp;D board's principal, largest and most wide reaching support program. This is a program which even the Industry Commission, after a major study, acknowledged was of net benefit to Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the early 1980s, business expenditure on R&amp;D has grown at an average real rate of around 13 per cent a year, largely due to that concession. In  effect, the government tore out millions of dollars from R&amp;D assistance schemes, complemented by an all&hyphen;out assault on our intellectual capital, in other words, on our higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the government is now seeking comfort in the fact that in 1995-96 there was a 22 per cent growth in business R&amp;D expenditure, but I remind the Senate that that 1995&hyphen;96 figure was prior to what is known as `the slash and burn first Costello budget'. The government cannot and should not seek to take comfort in that figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, it relates to investment prior to the first budget of the Treasurer (Mr Costello). In future years, R&amp;D growth is likely to be much less than it would otherwise have been. There is already evidence that the 125 per cent concession is of much reduced value once administration and compliance costs are taken into account. A survey of members of the Plastics and Chemicals Industry Association has shown that 20 per cent of companies which previously claimed the R&amp;D tax concession are no longer bothering. Secondly, a large part of the 22 per cent growth is accounted for by firms seeking to meet cut-off dates for getting their claims in due to government changes, rather than due to any real increases in R&amp;D expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, less than two per cent of firms invest in R&amp;D. In other words, it is only a small number of relatively elite companies which are committed to competing at the leading edge. The government must take a leading role in broadening such activities. Fourthly, strong growth increases in R&amp;D expenditure are needed if our firms are to remain internationally competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our regional neighbours are achieving substantially higher annual average growth rates in business R&amp;D expenditure than Australia. South Korea's investment levels are growing at over 30 per cent, Singapore's at almost 25 per cent and Taiwan around 17 per cent. Moreover, Australian business investment in R&amp;D has peaked at only 0.74 per 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7758"> cent of GDP. This is very low compared to other developed countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Japan, the USA and Switzerland each invest around two per cent of GDP per year in business R&amp;D, nearly three times that of Australia. Something must be done. A plethora of recent reports have called on the government to reverse its first year, short-sighted decisions before they cause further damage to our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian industry must be adequately encouraged and supported in its efforts to undertake R&amp;D. This is crucial if our firms are to be leading edge competitors. To achieve this, the government must boost incentives for business research and development, restoring them at least to their full value before they were slashed by the government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I speak briefly in relation to the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation annual report of 1996&hyphen;97, I indicate that a ridiculous situation is developing in the Senate at the moment. Every time we deal with these reports&mdash;and we have a very long list, as normally happens at this time of year&mdash;the reports, which people quite rightly wish to speak to and they reserve for Thursday, will never be spoken to at this rate because our standing orders currently mean that we never get to reports on Thursdays.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the list now. Is there any likelihood that we will ever get to speak to those re 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ports? The answer is no; the current change in standing orders on Thursday means that we will not speak to those reports. The list will get longer and longer. There is an urgent need for us to address that situation. These reports are very important. They are often the only chance the public has to hear about what these organisations have been doing during the year and to respond at a parliamentary level. I do not want to use up the rest of my time on that, but the matter should be looked to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Fisheries Research and Development Corporation is largely meant to be looking at sustainability in Australia's fisheries. What is sad is that in a report like this we do not really get much of an idea of how we are going. At various times during the year we see reports from other bodies on shark sustainability, shark numbers, and other commercial fishing, but it is very difficult to know how we are going from this kind of report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be a pity if we did not get an idea about one of the major areas&mdash;the sustainability of Australia's fishery stocks. It is very important as an ecosystem. It is very important as a support system for other ecosystems&mdash;for instance, seabirds. It is also very important for the vastly intricate network of knowledge of climate change that we have an idea of how things are going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a pity that there is no immediately obvious area in such a report that says how the research and development corporation thinks Australia is going in relation to ecological sustainability, especially fishing sustainability of different species. This may well be available in other areas, but there might be some way in subsequent years that those kinds of issues could be reported in a summarised form in this kind of report. As the report has already been reserved, I will speak no further. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Some very important issues are canvassed in the annual report of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. These issues involve some of the changes that are occurring in Australia's food standards. For instance, the section on page 15 of the annual report deals with the World Trade Organisation. It says that the authority fulfils Australia's obligations to the WTO in relation to food standards by taking into account the requirements of the Codex Alimentarius when assessing proposed changes to the Australian food standards code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not necessarily a good thing. It means the lowest common denominator. It means that, if we want to have a higher standard than the Codex Alimentarius, we have to justify it. It is not that somebody else has to justify their standards. If we think there is anything higher than the code that we should adhere to, we have to justify that to the World Trade Organisation. A huge level of sovereignty has been acceded, and it is obviously creating difficulties in a number of areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also mentions the two World Trade Organisation treaty agreements that are particularly important for trade in food: the agreements on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures, or SPS. We have had a number of debates here about Customs and the level of quarantine scrutiny, and those 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> phrases in this kind of report deal with those issues. In WTO&hyphen;speak, these are called TBTs&mdash;technical barriers to trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They seem to assume that sanitary and phytosanitary measures or quarantine measures are primarily health related, but they refer to any measure applied to protect animal or plant life or human health from risks. The technical barriers to trade are primarily not health related and relate to requirements covering product characteristics or their related processes and production methods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trouble is that, once again, you have to prove that your measures are not technical barriers to trade. As we have debated so many times in this chamber, often it is close to impossible to prove that the many different areas of contention in relation to products such as cooked chicken meat or salmon or other fish products are going to destroy your industry. The only way you can prove it is when your industry is destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also see within this report, under the heading `Standards amended in 1996-97', such things as increased cadmium levels in rice crackers, amendments to the standard A14 residues in food and edible coatings for fresh and processed fruit and vegetables. There have been changes brought about as well by the push from the very large Monsanto company to make sure that they do not have any problems in getting Roundup accepted in various forms and the products associated with Roundup. There are genetically engineered products like Roundup ready soya beans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in a fairly innocuous jacket, the annual report of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, once again, is something which has many issues that we should be looking at very carefully. I have had limited time to look at the report, but there are a number of areas which are very worrying and may have major impacts on the standards of Australia and New Zealand. I think it is the kind of issue that should be dealt with more. What I intend to do is look into this report and perhaps speak about it in an adjournment debate at a later time, because Thursdays are not really available at the moment, and talk about the issues involved with this report and the

<PARA STYLE="Para">There are some issues that I would like to highlight in this annual report. I would have to say that I have given a big tick to the fact that one of their programs involves the use of agroforestry to sustain natural resources. The report states the goal of the program, which is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To develop practical methods and systems for agroforestry on farms and elsewhere, for the combined purposes of commercial timber and tree products, increased agricultural productivity and sustainable management of natural resources.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think their activities at this stage really involve collecting information. The report states that a major publication on design principles for agroforestry, aimed to meet particular objectives and combinations, was released. I will be looking forward to seeing more development in relation to that because it is one of the very positive measures in relation to value adding and improved water quality, soil quality and productivity, as well as ecological sustainability on farms&mdash;where it is appropriate&mdash;in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Page 38 of the report, which is headed `Commonwealth government initiatives', mainly deals with the Natural Heritage Trust. Many of us realise that that  is a front for pulling out funds from other areas and that, when it finishes, it will mean a dramatic drop in funding for the environment. On page 38, the report states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has recognised the importance of climate variability R&amp;D and the need to establish a policy environment where landholders are more self-reliant and better prepared for periodic drought with sound land management practices and greater attention to planning and risk management.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Gosh! No mention of El Nino and no mention of the very likely connection in relation to greenhouse gas increases throughout the world. Obviously one hand realises that the rural community is calling out for assistance to deal with climatic variability associated with El Nino weather patterns; that is, more frequent, longer lasting El Nino weather patterns which result in droughts, floods and damaging storms in some areas. We realise it is costing a lot of money but, hey, we are still out there trying to tell the rest of the world that it is going to be a problem for us to pull our weight and be involved in greenhouse gas reductions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the heading `Identifying and taking advantage of markets and investment opportunities', there is an indication that there is increasing evidence that the ecological soundness of agricultural production systems and the products themselves will be an important influence on world markets. In many ways, ecological sustainability will be a prime focus of marketability on the world market in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, we should be doing everything we can to make sure that Australia is at the leading edge of ecological sustainability. Whether it is the energy use within our farming systems, whether it is our use of water and so on or whether it is the use of pesticides and genetically engineered products, we should be taking steps at this stage so that we can be at the leading edge. So when people are calling for cleaner, greener production, Australia will be able to say, `We have been working on this, and we are far advanced along that line.'

<PARA STYLE="Para">These are two reports given to the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) by Mr Michael Dodson, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. They are both very lucid reports. They demonstrate the intellectual power of Mr Dodson, who was a member of the Victorian Bar and a very great contributor in that role. He has gone on to become a commissioner and to do a lot for human rights. That should be acknowledged, and I do so now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Bill of Rights in America was adopted about two centuries ago as, I think, the first lot of amendments to the constitution. We have not got a bill of rights in Australia, but there is a good development within this country which more and more makes people conscious of human rights and conscious of the rights we have as citizens. There is a variety of organisations that do develop that sense we have of citizenship and that sense of human rights. Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan, your committee, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, has contributed to that. But there are others that have contributed, including the Law Reform Commission and arguments in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Well up with everybody else who contributes to the development of citizenship and to the development of human rights in Australia is Mr Michael Dodson. These two reports are an illustration of that very issue. He has the legal capacity, the intellectual ability and the passion for rights that is needed to extend the boundaries of citizenship and to extend the boundaries that limit the rights and obligations we have as members of this society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look, for example, at the fifth report of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, you will see he 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> deals with matters such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. He talks about racism. He talks about people who play Australian rules football, who have again been people who have extended the concept we have of what it means to be a citizen of this community and of what it means to be a person who enjoys human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has quotes here from Michael Long, a great footballer from Essendon; Jeff Farmer; Maurice Rioli, who used to play for Richmond; Nicky Winmar, who played in the grand final; and Che Cockatoo-Collins, again an Essendon player.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak largely to the native title report of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. Commissioner Dodson has included in this report a long chapter on the Wik debate. Obviously, it deserves to be taken seriously into consideration. I would like to point out that this kind of information is becoming more and more frequent in the public arena.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Herron says, `What are they going to do about Northern Ireland?' I think that is a fairly odd way to respond to an unprecedented event for the British parliament. Northern Ireland is an area where the British parliament is attempting to make some changes, but it does not take anything away from the need for Australia to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7762"> take its own human rights responsibilities seriously. Since it is so unusual for the British parliament to take such an unprecedented step, we should be taking notice of that. I am sure there will be other countries joining in as time goes on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to point out that in this native title report there is a section on constitutional reform. Commissioner Dodson said in his introduction to the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing is more important to the shaping of our national character than the way in which our elected representatives respond to the High Court's decision in Wik Peoples and Thayorre Peoples v State of Queensland (`Wik').</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is very true. I mentioned the British parliamentarians. There is endorsement of the move to potentially boycott the Sydney 2000 Olympics. I think there is a lot that ought to be taken notice of in relation to the current situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) the British parliamentarian human rights group suggested that the government's approach to the Wik legislation was placing Australia's reputation at risk. Jeremy Corbyn MP said that he hoped to convey these concerns to Mr Howard at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Edinburgh later this week. I know a number of journalists from Australia will be going to the CHOGM conference and I do hope there is a response from Mr Howard that is appropriate. Mr Corbyn said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aborigines in Australia suffered high levels of unemployment and infant mortality, lower life expectancy and much poorer living standards than the rest of the population.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like briefly to mention the section on constitutional reform. There is an area where it is indicated that it would be a very good idea in the commissioner's viewpoint to start looking at things such as a bill of rights. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I would have to say that I am very much in agreement that we should be looking at such things&mdash;looking at how our constitution can be moulded to deal with the views and needs of Australia into the next century.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to discuss the issue of Medicare office closures and the impact this is having on local communities. Of particular 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7763"> concern to me is the closure of the East Victoria Park Medicare office in Western Australia within the federal division of Swan. It is important to note that this closure in East Victoria park is like so many others that are going on around the nation. Of equal concern is that these closures do not stand alone. They are apparently part of a broad health policy that has seen a fundamental re-evaluation of the priorities of health care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Predominantly, this re-evaluation has seen a shift from health care provided on the basis of need to health care provided on the basis of those who can afford it. Some of those broad based health policies that are in tune with this government's approach are cuts to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, cuts to the dental care scheme, cuts to the funding of public hospitals and failure of the government to adequately compensate doctors through Medicare, thus shifting future cost burdens to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now the government has decided to reduce the accessibility of the major Australian health&hyphen;care provider, Medicare. This decision is made against a background of community support for Medicare and a belief in the provision of services by Medicare offices. This has been validated by consistently high client satisfaction reports from around the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The government has underestimated the role that Medicare offices play in local communities and has added to the perception in the community that the government seeks to implement policy that disadvantages those most in need. The Medicare office in East Victoria Park is a classic case in point. This office is situated in an area of metropolitan Western Australia that is seeing an increase in the density of its dwellings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, much of this population density is the result of young families moving into the region and elderly people moving into smaller accommodation units within the area. These two groups in particular rely heavily on the Medicare office in East Victoria Park and benefit from its close regional proximity. The importance of this Medicare office is highlighted by the fact that it deals with approximately 40,000 claims per year.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of the government's&mdash;and the local federal member's&mdash;argument in regard to closure of the Medicare office is based on the fact that there are three other such offices within 15 kilometres of East Victoria Park. The government argues that the clients of the East Victoria Park office have other offices within a close proximity. Of course, these other offices deal with a large number of claims per year already.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the government has missed the point. The fact that there are other offices within a relatively close distance but that the East Victoria Park office processes 163 claims per day highlights the important role it plays in the local community and the reliance of families living in the area on local infrastructure. For many, use of another office would drag people out of the local region and congest already busy offices in other areas. For those young families without access to a vehicle during working hours, travelling into the CBD to lodge a Medicare claim is extremely inconvenient. For elderly people, public transport into the CBD or large shopping areas can be a trying experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's response to this argument is that Medicare clients can mail in their Medicare claims and have reimbursement processed through an automatic deposit into a bank account. However, this process ensures that those sections of the community with low cash reserves are without cash for a number of days and an expense is incurred through postage and bank debit fees by way of automatic bank deposit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, a family with three children who all catch the flu in the one week could be faced with bills of around $90 in GP fees alone and on top of this is the added cost of medication. A process through which claims are mailed into the CBD and then processed would ensure that families could be without a significant amount of their weekly income for a number of days. For most families, $90 in one week is, of course, a considerable amount of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> For elderly Australians who may visit a doctor once a fortnight, the cost of mailing Medicare claims forms would be an overall increase in health&hyphen;care costs to that patient. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7764"> For pensioners in today's economic climate, this is another intrusion on their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue goes to the heart of a number of matters. Firstly, members of the community have had another service taken away from their local community. The rationale behind local offices is that they are placed in the area to serve the public. They provide an opportunity to discuss problems, are a contact point, and are invaluable to those in need. For those with an affluent lifestyle or self&hyphen;transport, this may not be an imperative; for some it is. Young families and those who really need care and support run the risk of being marginalised. It is not enough to see that their local branches are all being centralised, or that banks are closing offices and installing electronic devices to dispense cash; they have to tolerate another erosion in the service level to their local community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a community that has suffered much in the last year. Demand for local business has been down, with many closures and falling employment. Now this will be compounded by the withdrawal of one more important government or semi-government service. It seems logical to me that a public service that brings 40,000 people a year into the local area would produce some run&hyphen;off for affected local business. This is a point that has been entirely overlooked by the local member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, many of our local communities are fragile entities. They depend partly on business and partly on government for survival. When either of these elements is missing, they are subject to damage. When government makes the decision to remove services, the price is sometimes not always evident by simply an accounting bottom line. The cost is hidden; it is the deterioration of the local community. When this Medicare office closes, the department next door is rationalised. There is precious little for the local small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, what of the staff and families that are currently employed in these offices? They have been forced to transfer to other locations, many having served the pre-existing locality for many years.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another vexing point is the government's decisions to close these offices at this point in time. The Health Insurance Commission claims that, within the next 12 months, electronic lodgments will be available for Medicare within the office of the local GP. If this is the case, why does the government seek to place a financial burden and cost on the local community of East Victoria Park at this time? If the government were concerned with the interests of the local community, they would have closed the Medicare office at a time concurrent with the introduction of electronic lodgment in the GP's office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I will comment about the impact of Medicare office closure in other states around the country. In a review conducted by AGB McNair, a number of problems were identified. The lack of personal contact in claim processing meant that the process of correction was a costly and time consuming delay. The review identified that more than 33 per cent of claims lodged were incorrect or required more information. Had these claims been lodged in person  at the local office, problems could have been rectified on the spot. Instead, it took a number of days for problems to be dealt with, and added to an already considerable delay in cost reimbursement for patients. In addition to this, a whole range of other problems were identified in the new process. Unfortunately, I do not have time to deal with them tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is evident that the Medicare office closure in East Victoria Park is part of a broad government policy to cut back health care services. The government has illustrated its first priority to be immediate financial savings as opposed to public service that contributes to the local community in a number of ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an issue at the core of community concerns regarding this government and their commitment to service, and it highlights yet again the failure of this government to understand the importance of universal health care and accessibility.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7764"><TITLE>Aboriginal Education</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak about my experiences as part of our current inquiry into the status 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7765"> of teachers and, in particular, to talk about the day of the hearing on Wednesday last week, which was held in Maningrida and Djamada, two communities at the northern extremes of the Northern Territory. Because the hearings were not recorded on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> , I want to place those experiences on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The day was very memorable for a number of reasons, but primarily for the insights it provided into remote Aboriginal schooling in the territory. This was my first experience in an isolated Aboriginal community, and it was indeed an enlightening one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was unaware&mdash;like most Australians, I suspect&mdash;that although Aboriginal people, particularly in remote parts of Australia, still speak in their indigenous tongue, many Aboriginal people speak two, three and sometimes many more languages. But many speak little English and, for them, the need to do so has little relevance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory has worked very hard to train Aboriginal teachers through its Batchelor College, and it is educating Aboriginal teachers within their own communities as well. At Maningrida the school is trilingual, and there are two main indigenous languages used in its primary level classrooms. But, in that region, Aboriginal people sometimes live a nomadic lifestyle, and hunting and fishing are often a way of life for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because white culture's schooling is just one aspect of their lives, the indigenous community does not always see the relevance of education, particularly in English. For the first time in my life, I was acutely aware of the way in which we are still imposing a very foreign culture on these people. We expect them to value school and learning, and to receive that learning from people whose culture is so very different from their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some families it is even culturally inappropriate for children to have more knowledge than their parents. There are cultural differences in the status that we accord teachers and those of the traditional Aboriginal communities, and there are enormous complexities associated with those relationships. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We appoint times for schooling, which makes absolutely no sense to many Aboriginal people or even, I might say, to the white teachers who teach there&mdash;especially in the hot season. When temperatures are close to 40 degrees in the mid-afternoon, it is impossible for either the teachers or the students to concentrate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard up there that attendance in school is spasmodic and depends on other cultural events, such as the needs of the families, primarily for food collection, and for ceremonial occasions which are numerous and very rarely predictable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard too that the Northern Territory government staffed schools like Maningrida on an average attendance. This means that, early in the school term or when the weather is not too hot, there may be a maximum attendance, and classes which are designed for 30 or so students may swell to 50 or 60. Eventually, those students who do not fit in, are less enthusiastic or do not get the attention of the teacher, drift away. It is not infrequent for a teacher to face a class of different children altogether from one day to the next. A large majority of Aboriginal children have hearing problems associated with infections and the services&mdash;or rather lack of them&mdash;in the area. The obstacles to teaching and to learning are enormous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the wet season, many communities and families are cut off, and this is yet another reason why children do not attend school. I was told that the difference between Aboriginal languages and English is enormous. They are so different that very few white teachers&mdash;or balanda, as they are called&mdash;or even those who have lived in the area for some time, learn an Aboriginal language. The reason for this is, as I understand it, the very great difference in the structures of those languages and English. That was a lesson for me in how difficult it is for Aboriginal people too whose first language is not English to learn to communicate in English&mdash;and not just to communicate in English but to learn in English.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the points that I wanted to make most strongly today was that we need to realise that Aboriginal children do not have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7766"> English as a second language status in terms of the additional support that many immigrant children have, for instance. This, in itself, it seems to me, is a denial of the fact, which became so obvious to us in the Northern Territory, that learning English and learning in English is a very difficult task for so many of these children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In persuading children that they should come to school, it is also very difficult to put the argument that children need education to improve their career prospects. By and large, the only opportunity for children to get jobs in communities as remote as these is by moving away, and to do so is not always culturally or socially appropriate. Here in Canberra we rely upon statistics on attendance in schools and retention rates to measure achievement in education, and I myself have drawn attention to the very low levels of both achievement and retention in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee went from Darwin, where it had a day's hearing, to Maningrida and then on by single engine aircraft to Djamada, which is a very small outpost community of about 12 or so houses. After we arrived at the airstrip, we picked our way across a rubbish strewn area between the houses, many of which were uninhabited, to a women's shelter. This was an open structure which did at least provide us with shade and a semblance of a cool breeze. We sat on the floor in this shelter with visiting balanda teachers and local Aboriginal teachers and we discussed the issues for teachers in this very hot, dry and, to our urban eyes, I would have to say, inhospitable environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The visiting teachers who come to Djamada for usually three days a month have to bring along a tent because there is no other accommodation in this area. There is a tank of bore water but very few other services. I left there thinking that it was quite remarkable, really, that education of the balanda variety takes place at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For me, this experience was a great education and a reminder of the enormous value that our committee system brings to the Senate&mdash;one which takes us out to speak very directly with people so, no matter how remote 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they are from Canberra, they are actually able to speak directly with the decision makers. I was also reminded of how often the decisions that we make in this place affect people in the way that they do, regardless of the distance they might be away from this place.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7766"><TITLE>Regional Centres: Employment Opportunities</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening, I rise to recount an experience I had Saturday week ago on 11 October when I met with some of the councillors and the CEO from the Roma Council to the west of Brisbane. I draw this to the attention of the Senate this evening because I thought they said some very pertinent things about the frustration that is felt by regional centres in the bush.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their first concern, their major concern, was the fact that people are moving away for two reasons&mdash;that is, to study and to seek work. But, of course, their prime concern in that was the fact that these people never return. The reason for that is there are no employment opportunities to be found in the community. In talking with the CEO and the councillors from the Roma Council, I found that I felt a sense of frustration on their part. I think they felt that the government, whether it be state or federal, does not have the answer to the biggest problem facing their community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst they were able to tell me that tourism had assisted to some extent in stabilising some employment in the area, it was not going to be a major contributor to employment growth in the area. So, whilst there was some good coming out of tourism, tourism would never provide the answers to the employment needs of Roma and its surrounding districts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They said that there was a dilemma in the rural and regional areas of Australia in providing real jobs for people, and they complained to me that there was no strategy in place to help regional centres either survive or grow. I would imagine that, if one took the opportunity to move throughout Queensland and, albeit, other regional areas throughout Australia, one would find a similar concern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7767"> being raised. They did raise with me, though, the fact that there were key regional centres in Queensland around which governments could plan growth, if governments had the mind to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They raised an interesting issue: that all local governments in Queensland apparently have to produce a five&hyphen;and 10&hyphen;year plan. But they said no such plan was forced upon the likes of the federal government. They thought that this, in part, led to some of the difficulties that confronted them. Whilst they had a plan, neither the state government nor the federal government necessarily had a plan to address the issues and the solutions that they perceived.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They believe that a reasonable strategic plan may well ameliorate the difficulties currently being faced in the bush. In their plans they have had to address issues like population, infrastructure needs and developments, which will create employment within their regions. However, they say that no such demand, of course, has been placed on either the state or federal governments. Whilst there is much rhetoric out there, they say there is no real commitment to assist major regional hubs such as Roma. They say that there needs to be a plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They went on to give a very interesting example of how planning&mdash;or no planning&mdash;fails them. They gave me an example of a problem that they were having with the state government in Queensland and the bureaucrats. They were most anxious to be competitive in a bid to secure a gaol in their region. They estimate that the gaol would create some 285 jobs. They concede that about 120 of those jobs would be imported from outside, by specialists needed to run and operate the gaol, but there would be at least another 165 local jobs created. It would also put money into the community to generate other jobs, so they saw a flow&hyphen;on effect there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, they ran into two obstacles. The two obstacles were: firstly, bureaucrats; and, secondly, the state government, because both ignored any sites west of the Great Dividing Range. I fear that this is part of the problem that we have in our nation. We forget that substantial numbers of people do live west of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Great Dividing Range and do want government support and government initiatives to help them keep their communities alive and thriving. Of course, they were fairly dogged in their approach to this issue. Whilst they had been excluded in the first instance, they ended up convincing the bureaucrats, and to some extent I believe the state government, to at least consider that that the region should be eligible to compete for the siting of a gaol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They showed resolve and one must admire their resolve in sticking to their guns. If only the Queensland government could have the faith in these places inasmuch as they have the faith in themselves. I think that is an important thing; these rural communities do have faith in themselves and do believe in themselves, but they are looking for real government support, whether it be at the state government level or at the  federal government level. Roma is far from finished as a viable and vibrant competitor with other sites throughout south&hyphen;east Queensland for this goal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing that the councillors drew to my attention was the fact that they have being trying to establish a fertiliser plant in Roma. That does not sound overly exciting but they point out that given their location, a fertiliser plant makes great sense. The unfortunate story about the fertiliser plant is that its establishment has been launched on at least three or four occasions and on each occasion it has failed for a number of reasons. Of course, this time looks like being the most positive opportunity for this project to get off the ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have natural gas flowing past the front door, so to speak, and they have ample supplies of water to support the manufacture of urea in the area. However, they need venture capital. Whilst they have a long way to go, they have hope. I believe the federal government should be intervening in these areas to support councils, such as the Roma council, which do have faith, hope and a vision. Whilst they have a forward looking approach to life, they rely on government to step in and to assist them. One would hope that the federal government will take initiatives to help places such as Roma and com 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7768"> munities that are fighting for their survival. One would hope that those who reside west of the divide are not deserted, as they seem to have been by this government. One would hope that governments, both state and federal, which have the opportunity to create a climate and an environment to give more major regional centres the boost that they need, will do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What they really need are jobs&mdash;real, lasting jobs&mdash;and, of course, they want government intervention to assist them in achieving that. I think that was the real story that came out of my visit to Roma and I think it is worthwhile putting on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record this evening. I believe that the federal government should act now to show it cares about rural Australia, to show that it is desirous of helping those people who have a vision for the future&mdash;a vision which will maintain a vibrant and viable rural and regional Australia.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="7.44 p.m." PAGE="7768"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 7.44 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) Any case referred to the AFP must meet referral criteria as outlined in the `Guidelines for Referral and Acceptance of Social Security Matters for Investigation by the Australian Federal Police'.
