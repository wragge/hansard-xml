<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Monday I received written advice from my department that a pilot review of rent assistance recipients in public housing had found that 100 per cent claimed more than the rent which would be paid to the State Housing Authority by a couple on a social security payment with a dependent child or would be paid by a sole parent with a dependent child. I repeated that advice in the information I gave to the Senate. Today I have been informed that the figure of 100 per cent is not accurate and that it is not possible at this stage to provide an accurate figure. For that, I apologise to the Senate. I very much regret that that information was given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am able to inform the Senate of the basis for the estimates and provide the department's advice to me about the number of households in this situation. I turn to the basis for the estimates. The calculation of savings from the measure are necessarily estimates. For privacy reasons, it is not possible to collect all the necessary data until the legislation has been passed. The definitive figures will not be known until matching has been completed with data supplied by state housing authorities. The data on which the estimates are based, therefore, is not conclusive but it is indicative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The estimates of savings assume that 44,000 people will be affected by the measure. These estimates are based on review activity and computer matching to identify rent assistance recipients in public housing covering four areas in regional and metropolitan New South Wales covering 4,942 dwellings. This was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> complemented by pilot reviews of 60 people in one location to survey rent assistance recipients in more detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proportion of dwellings containing rent assistance recipients ranges from 10 per cent to 24 per cent but over the four areas totalled 21 per cent of these dwellings. In developing the costings, allowances were then made to cater for houses attracting market rents and factors such as movement in and out of public housing. It was assumed that those affected were being paid at the average level of rent assistance&mdash;that is, less than the maximum rate&mdash;being paid at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the number of households where the principal tenant is charging subtenants more than the rent that has to be paid to the State Housing Authority. The available information suggests that most principal tenants with subtenants receiving rent assistance are charging the subtenants more than the additional rent that they have to pass on to the State Housing Authority in respect of that subtenant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anecdotal evidence supported by some limited individual reviews suggest that there are cases where subtenants of public housing are charged a level of rent which exceeds the total household rent that the principal tenant has to pay to the SHA. However, until more detailed information is available from matching with data supplied by SHAs, it is not possible to define the extent to which this occurs. None of this changes the fundamentals. The government set out to prevent persons who were receiving the advantages of living in public housing getting further advantage from rent assistance. The measure achieves that purpose.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am somewhat concerned that this disclosure did not come forward until the government was requested to provide that information. It leads to the conclusion that, except for the fact that the opposition and Senator Harradine requested the information of the survey, it may never have been dis 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7272"> closed to this chamber that there had been an error. I suppose I cannot say that that is absolutely the case, but I think that many people who followed the debate might question that in their minds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems unlikely to me, bearing in mind that there is a sample of only 60 people, that it is really impossible over the period that this bill has been debated to take out the personal aspects contained in the review and give us some numbers as to those people who are supposedly receiving more from their sublettors than they are paying in additional rent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the Senate, in relying on any of the information that we have been advised by the minister is contained in this survey or review, should treat this information with a great deal of caution. I would even go so far as to suggest that senators should put this matter out of their minds in determining whether or not they should support the amendment that we are shortly going to be dealing with.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have gone through this debate quite extensively, but because of the elapse of time since we last dealt with it, I would like to briefly recap. The effect of this amendment is to ensure that the benchmarking against average weekly male total earnings is set in legislation for allowances as well as for pensions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who will not have the benefit of this benchmarking, even through an automatic flow&hyphen;on, are about 800,000 unemployed

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless this request is carried, all those people I have just mentioned will not be benchmarked and, in real terms against general wages in the community, their allowances will be moving backwards.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Neal was claiming yesterday that Labor in government had always benchmarked the pension to 25 per cent. I would ask her if she would like to reconsider that statement.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME><STATE> (Queensland)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(9.39 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to make a couple of comments in this debate that have not been canvassed before. I have got to say that I do understand the minister's concern about Labor at this point because they really should have fixed this when they were in government. If they have not, I can understand the minister being a little put out. However, the other point that I want to make is: whether or not Labor did it when they were in government, it is debatable whether that should be the basis for what this government should do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is right to make the benchmark the male total weekly average earnings for pensioners, I believe it is also right to make that the benchmark for allowees. The reason I say that is because one of the problems we have with benchmarking and linking that to the CPI is that the CPI is based on a basket of goods which, for pensioners and allowees, is fairly irrelevant. In fact, one of the complaints I constantly get from pensioners is that when they go into their local shop to buy food, their perception is that prices are always going up. The reason why their perception that it is costing them more to live does not line up with the small increase in the CPI which we are experiencing at the moment is that those baskets of goods contain things such as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7273"> interest rates which, as we know, are at almost an all time low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basic consumables which are important to pensioners do not play as large a part in the CPI as would indicate to pensioners that the CPI is an accurate measure of the costs they are experiencing. That is why the Democrats are inclined to support these amendments. We do believe that the male total average weekly earnings is a much more accurate measure at the present time for pensions and allowances. In terms of those on low incomes, I know there is some work being done on the CPI which would perhaps make it a better reflection of the costs they experience but, until that is done, the Democrats certainly believe that male total average weekly earnings is a more accurate benchmark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My understanding is that in most of the European countries social security payments are tied to minimum wages, so obviously that is a recognition that that is, at the present time, a more accurate measurement. I simply share that information as part of this debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am. I just wanted to allow Senator Woodley the opportunity to have his say. I want to clarify any misunderstanding that the minister may have about the statements I made yesterday. I want to say absolutely that I concede, and have always conceded in this debate, that there was no legislation in place for the benchmarking of pensions but the government, since about 1991, always ensured that pensions were at least 25 per cent of average male weekly earnings, except for one occasion when it slipped behind by some 15c. I believe that was in about 1993 but I am not absolutely certain about that. Maybe the department can confirm that.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="7273" TIME="9.43 a.m." SPEAKER="Newman, Sen Jocelyn" NAMEID="BE4" ELECTORATE="TAS" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Social Security" GOV="1">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Neal for her attempt to clarify what she was claiming 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> yesterday. My recollection is that she claimed that the ALP had always benchmarked pensions at 25 per cent. I therefore would table a table demonstrating the single rate of pension as a percentage of male total average weekly earnings, from February 1983 to May 1997, by quarter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing is that, as I said yesterday, despite Gough Whitlam's claiming that they were going to benchmark pensions to 25 per cent of MTAWE, and despite the fact that that remained Labor party policy&mdash;we had the Hawke and Keating governments going from February 1983 through to 18 months ago&mdash;as the table will show, it was only after 1991 that they started to take action about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is not a very convincing argument that you have just used, Senator Neal. I am glad that your government saw the light late in its day but it did have a long time to, first of all, actually benchmark the pensions to the 25 per cent and also to do something about putting it into legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I think Senator Woodley said that the CPI was irrelevant in terms of benchmarks for pensions. I do not know whether he is aware that in 1993&mdash;I think it was 1993; I am not positive of that from memory&mdash;the Australian Bureau of Statistics did a pensioner index, if you like, and found that that would be disadvantageous to pensioners largely because it did not include housing costs. Even though older people have frequently paid off their home&mdash;not all of them are home owners, anyway&mdash;the cost of their home flows back to them in maintenance costs, rates, land tax and things like that. So in a very real sense housing costs are still an issue for older people. It was not a very good index.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you said, work is continuing by the Bureau of Statistics. Often pensioners are not aware of the fact that it is not the Department of Social Security that sets the index. We take an independent umpire's assessment of the index. I think Senator Woodley also said that the MTAWE would be a more accurate benchmark for pensions to be tied to. I would question that. I do not think it is a question of more accuracy. It is a question of yet another benchmark. So pensioners will now have the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7274"> benefits of two benchmarks. One relates to the cost of living as ABS determines it and the other relates to the standard of living of those in the workplace. It is good for the dignity of older Australians to have their entitlements tied to those two indices. That surely means that we are guaranteeing to the best we can as a government that pensioners will not miss out if the cost of living rises or if wages rise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley mentioned Europe. I think there is a misconception there. The majority of European countries have pension schemes which are directly related to the workplace. They are insurance schemes and, therefore, are tied to people's contribution rates. So it is like trying to compare apples with oranges to use that analogy in this debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister for that explanation. I certainly would not want to move to the European system and tie the pension to the wage people are receiving when they retire because that would put in a whole unjust differential. The information I had was that the minimum wage is also a significant factor, certainly in the Netherlands. But I accept that we are talking about the same thing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The effect of these requests is to ensure that pensions are, in fact, benchmarked at 25 per cent of MTAWE at all times rather than just at the particular point of time the benchmarking is done. The present proposal contained within the government's legislation means that, though at the point of benchmarking it will be at least 25 per cent, for the subsequent six months the pension will fall behind. In fact, it is potentially possible that, in a situation where wages are increasing at a reasonably rapid rate, the balance of the six months pensions could be less than 25 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These requests actually base the variation on a prediction of what total average weekly earnings will be in six months time. So it ensures that at all times the pension is above that 25 per cent benchmark, not just at the commencement of the six-month period.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do have some quite serious points to make about requests 5, 6, 7 and 9. I hope that Senator Neal and Senator Woodley will take particular account of these matters, because I believe they are not simply debating points but very important issues to consider before voting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ALP requests 5, 6, 7 and 9 provide that, instead of using the existing published figures, as proposed by the government, the figures to be used will be anticipated figures. These anticipated figures will be produced by taking an annualised figure, which will be obtained from the last quarter for which figures are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7276"> available, and multiplying it by the square root of the percentage increase which has been forecast for the next four quarters in the most recent budget papers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, the ALP requests do not provide that the budget papers have to be papers that are available to the public, so there is some question about whether confidential Treasury figures&mdash;not yet released&mdash;would have to be used. For any government, that would be totally inappropriate. That is the first point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, there is a contradiction in the ALP requests. I do not know if they are aware of this, but ALP requests 6 and 7 refer to anticipating the next June or December quarter, whereas ALP request 9 provides that the figure to be used is the percentage increase forecast for the next four quarters. That is confusing and strange, to say the least. Perhaps we will get an explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly&mdash;and perhaps this is the most serious of all for any government to face&mdash;when the ALP made an ad hoc increase in 1993, they used anticipated figures rather than the actual figures. That led to a pension overpayment&mdash;which I am sure the ALP would not have chosen&mdash;in the order of $156.34 million over the six months to July 1993. That, you can see, is an unsatisfactory way of determining what the pension should be at any given time. The government is concerned to ensure that such excess payments are minimised. That is why the actual MTAWE figures are used, rather than anticipated figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our proposal is that the benchmark be assessed at the existing CPI indexation points of 20 March and 20 September each year. Those are chosen to try to minimise confusion to older people, so that things do not change too frequently in the year. They worry when they get a letter from us telling them that there has been a change, even if it is beneficial. They worry at the sight of the letter, often.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would be using the most recent figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They provide an accurate benchmark instead of relying on potentially inaccurate forecasts about the potential movements of average weekly earnings and inflation figures 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> between the two indexation points. Both of those would be forecast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not proposing to use Treasury projections of CPI or MTAWE growth, because of the confidential nature of those projections. As we all know from past history, the volatility of Treasury projections, which we have seen over the years, may lead to unnecessary increases or to no increase where an increase is warranted. I do not think any of us would want that to happen. In seeing that people got what they were entitled to and nothing more than they were entitled to, we would be totally reliant on the accuracy of Treasury's projections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">MTAWE is used as the measure because it measures the level of wages across the work force, including full&hyphen;time, part&hyphen;time, casual and junior employees. That, we believe, is a broad spread, reflective of community differences. It is very relevant to social security customers. For the reasons I have given, we in the government cannot accept the requests the opposition has introduced. They introduce cost and complexity and they would significantly increase outlays. For many reasons, as was demonstrated during Labor's 1993 increase, estimates made at budget time&mdash;up to 13 months in advance&mdash;may not be accurate. The ALP formula apparently aims to build in some allowance for rises in MTAWE between indexation points and the lag between the survey dates and the indexation points. I think I have made clear exactly why we find this unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude by saying that the ALP's formula could result in significant additional outlays where the actual figure is lower than the forecast figure. This would then build in to all future indexations. The formula proposed, as I have said, is complex. It lacks transparency to customers and, as the ALP would know from their 1993 expenditure&mdash;based on projections which cost so dearly because the actual increase in the MTAWE was less than the forecast relied on to pay those pension increases&mdash;that would not be fair to the taxpayer. I do not believe you could call it good government. If the forecasts were the other way around, it would also not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7277"> be fair to the pensioners if they were to get less than they should have been entitled to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will leave it at that, for senators to contemplate. I think these are very serious points which should be taken into account before a vote is taken.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to deal with the four matters that have been raised by the minister. I have to say that they really do not have any substance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an allegation made by the minister that the calculations would be based on projections contained in the budget papers which she says are not publicly available. The budget papers are publicly available. If there is some proposal by this government to no longer make the budget papers available, the minister should say so. At the present time, they are part of a public document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second matter the minister raised is that she seemed to think there was some sort of contradiction between the basis of anticipation as between requests 5&hyphen;7 and request no. 9. Requests 5 and 7 relate to a period of six months. You will see that, contained in request No. 9, the calculation is based on a square root of the twelve&hyphen;month period. Minister, you probably do not know this but I am sure your department can tell you: the square root of 12 months is six months. It is just a mathematical issue, but you should be advised that they are in fact equivalent. It is like saying that there is a discrepancy because on the one hand you have four and on the other two plus two. They are the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter that you have raised is the question of an overpayment; that there is a possibility that the anticipated MTAWE would in fact be higher than it actually is once it is reached. The accuracy of those figures entirely relies on the budget papers put together by the government, so it interests me that you are making an assertion that your government will not be able to provide accurate predictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bearing in mind your experience in employment growth and economic growth, I suppose I can understand why government ministers would be somewhat concerned about the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accuracy of their budget paper predictions. But in the general course of things these projections are reasonably accurate, though obviously occasionally they are wrong. The thing is that even if there is a slight inaccuracy, and occasionally this does occur, normally it involves a very small amount and the variation is then taken into account and rectified the next time the benchmarking occurs, six months later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one other matter that I should deal with. The minister seems to feel that, based on our proposal, there would be benchmarking more than twice a year. I wish to make it very clear, Minister, that our proposal is exactly the same as yours in terms of the number of times the benchmarking occurs; it would occur twice a year, the same as it would in your proposal. So the idea that, if our proposition were adopted by the Senate, there would be constant changes occurring and that pensioners would be threatened and concerned and frightened really holds no water at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamental point is: should pensioners have their pensions benchmarked so that they are always at least 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings or should they only be 25 per cent for one brief moment and then for the following six months slip behind, because that is the proposal that this government is putting forward? Their proposal is that, on one day in March and September, pensions would be 25 per cent of MTAWE but for virtually the rest of the year they would be slipping behind. In a period of very high wages growth, as appears to be developing under this government, that slipping behind could be quite substantial. We believe that, if this government has promised that pensions be benchmarked at that level, they should be benchmarked for the whole year, not just for the two days in the year and then slip behind the rest of the time. We believe that they are not really keeping their promise unless they accept our request. I would ask the minister to support this request on the basis that it ensures compliance with their promise to benchmark pensions at 25 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Speaking firstly about the budget papers issue, Senator Neal has been long enough in this place to understand that the term `budget papers' covers a range of papers. Some have always been publicly available and some have always not been publicly available, and Treasury forecasts fall into the latter category. The last Labor government did not make those papers available. It has not been the practice. So when I said that there was not an acceptable transparency, that was an accurate comment and one that I stand by. If you are proposing that it will change under the next government, that is yet another promise that I think you will find difficult to keep in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the overpayment issue, I think I have already made that very clear. You did not get your forecasts right and there was a $153 million extra bill that should not have been paid by the Australian taxpayer because the forecasts were wrong. I am not blaming you but there were Treasury forecasts on which your government acted. Are you saying that we should just knowingly introduce a system where such enormous inaccuracies and overpayments can be made? You said something about a slight inaccuracy. I would hardly call that a slight inaccuracy. You said it does not usually occur. You only benchmarked twice so you can hardly say `usually' anything. You said something about being rectified six months later. What if the flaw is the other way and the pensioners have not kept up to the standards of the men and women who are in the workplace in Australia over that six months? What if there has been a great growth.</PARA>

Really, it is the only feasible, responsible, practical legislative approach. Let us hope that the Senate can learn from the 1993 experience. It is not a route that you would responsibly go down.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I wish to state 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that Labor is supporting this legislation. That said, we do have some significant concerns about some of the provisions. Firstly, the bill is not strong enough in some areas and is clearly inappropriate in others, and I will be addressing these issues in the committee stage with a series of amendments to attempt to improve the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition believes it is hypocritical in the extreme for the government to be bringing forward this legislation concerned with budget honesty. This is the government that has conducted one of the most dishonest budget policies in the history of this country. This is the government that has invented the notion of core and non&hyphen;core promises&mdash;core and non&hyphen;core honesty. This is the government that has significantly reduced the amount of information in the budget papers. For example, in the first Costello budget the complete details of all the specific purpose payments to the states and territories were completely excluded from budget paper No. 3 so there was less information provided to the public and interested shareholders, not more. Thankfully, scrutiny by the opposition ensured that the proper information was included in the 1997 budget papers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can the government credibly begin to talk about budget honesty when, in last year's budget, they broke, at a minimum, $15 billion worth of promises? Let me run through some of these. The ABC: the coalition made a commitment that `we will maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC'&mdash;that promise was broken before the 1996 budget and it now represents a $209 million cut over four years. Child care: the coalition `has no plans whatever to change the operational subsidy to the community based long day care sector'&mdash;the 1996 budget abolished operational subsidies for community based long day care, which will increase fees by at least $14 per child per week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Health: `none of the coalition's health policy initiatives will entail cuts in funding for public hospitals'&mdash;the 1996 budget contained extensive reductions in funding to public hospitals through a combination of cuts to financial assistance grants to the states and cuts to hospital funding grants totalling 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7280"> around $800 million over four years. Labour market programs: the coalition `will maintain expenditure on labour market programs in real terms'&mdash;the 1996 budget cut these programs by $1.8 billion over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Older Australians: the coalition `will maintain all current Commonwealth concessions for older Australians'. What has happened to the Commonwealth dental health program? It ceased on 31 December 1996. This program provided basic and emergency dental care benefits to health card and Commonwealth seniors card holders. Research and development: the coalition `will maintain support for R&amp;D through the 150 per cent tax concession'&mdash;the coalition praised R&amp;D syndication before the election but R&amp;D syndication was abolished before the 1996 budget; the tax concession rate was reduced in the 1996 budget to 125 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regional development: the coalition `will maintain regional development funding of over $150 million over four years'&mdash;the whole program was abolished before the 1996 budget. States and territories: the coalition `will provide a fixed share of Commonwealth revenue to the states and territories in a way which is revenue neutral and which would guarantee current services'&mdash;a promise broken at the June Premiers Conference when financial assistance grants were cut by $1.5 billion over three years and specific purpose payments were cut by three per cent annually; the 1997 Premiers Conference confirmed this broken promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Taxation: `there will be no new taxes and no increases in existing taxes under a coalition government'&mdash;this promise has been broken on many occasions. For example, the 1996 budget contained the Medicare levy surcharge of one per cent for some taxpayers without private health insurance, and the infamous superannuation contributions surcharge tax of up to 15 per cent.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Calm down, Senator Kemp, you will hear a lot more about the super tax in the next year; that will become evident. On universities, the promise to maintain the level of Commonwealth funding 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to universities has also been broken in terms of operating grants which were cut before the budget by $623 million over four years.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">  Additionally, universities will suffer reductions in other funding that will mean that the total amount to be cut from universities will come to over $2 billion over four years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation should have been referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in accordance with a previous recommendation, recommendation 19 in report No. 341, that any fiscal reporting bill such as this bill should be referred to the JCPA subsequent to its tabling. The government ignored this recommendation when the legislation was introduced. The shadow Treasurer attempted to refer the bill to the JCPA, but was defeated by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, to ensure some level of close scrutiny, the Senate has referred the bill to the JCPA. Unfortunately, the reporting time imposed on the reference to the JCPA was too short&mdash;a point made by the chair, Mr Somlyay, in his forward to report No. 341. So only a cursory examination of the bill by the JCPA was possible. Nevertheless, the JCPA did point out some salient points about this bill, one of which is that this so&hyphen;called charter is non&hyphen;enforceable. Subclause 3(ii) of the bill specifically states that the bill is not judicially enforceable. So this trend of non&hyphen;binding regulation by the government continues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other prominent non&hyphen;binding regulatory initiative of this government is the code of conduct of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). We know that it is not enforced unless the opposition actually enforces it. We know that the Prime Minister only lives up to his code when we find out that someone has breached it and we bring it to public attention.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes; I agree. Any pretence that this legislation is creating new enforceable standards of disclosure and hence better conduct of fiscal policy is completely false as the bill ensures that no enforcement is possible. So this legislation is more appearances than substance. Nevertheless, the measure is worth support as long as its shortcomings are acknowledged and addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7281">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before discussing some of the flaws in the legislation, I will turn to the actual proposals in the bill. Basically, the bill seeks to build upon the general fiscal disclosure regime developed under Labor, with some further reporting requirements partly based on the model operating in New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is crucial to understand that this legislation is basically codifying the practice of full disclosure established by the previous Labor government. Labor supports this bill in principle, however we have very serious reservations about a number of proposals in it. I will return to discuss these aspects later in my remarks and in the committee stage. The major components of the fiscal and economic disclosure regime are, firstly, comprehensive budget documentation and information which outline the government's fiscal and economic strategy and, secondly, updating this information with a mid&hyphen;year review process and a final budget outcome statement subsequent to the end of the financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the bill proposes, firstly, a five&hyphen;year inter&hyphen;generational report which will assess the long&hyphen;term sustainability of current policies, especially in the context of expected demographic changes. Secondly, it proposes a pre&hyphen;election fiscal and economic report to be prepared by senior economic bureaucrats and, thirdly, a prescriptive regime on the costing of policy commitments by government agencies during an election campaign. The fiscal strategy followed by the government is to be based on principles of so&hyphen;called sound fiscal management, which are contained in clause 5 of the bill. As you would expect, these are broad motherhood statements which are meaningless in the context of actually formulating a budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now turn to some of Labor's more broad concerns about this legislation. With respect to economic forecasts, the bill provides, in some respects, for even less accountability than that recommended by the government's own Commission of Audit on the question of the charter. For example, the commission recommended making the economic forecasts in the budget, the mid&hyphen;year review and the pre&hyphen;election report the responsibility of economic bureaucrats instead of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> being at the discretion of the Treasurer. The government has agreed to this only in respect of the pre&hyphen;election statement, not the budget or the mid&hyphen;year review. By contrast, New Zealand requires certification of the economic forecasts by relevant bureaucrats for all parts of the budget cycle. Why is the Treasurer (Mr Costello) not prepared to submit himself to the same levels of honesty as required in New Zealand?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposal is in stark contrast to Mr Costello's practice whilst in opposition. He asked the then Treasurer that the 1995&hyphen;96 economic forecasts in the 1995&hyphen;96 budget be certified by the Secretary to the Treasury as being prepared without political interference. This was duly done in writing. As usual for the coalition, there is one standard in opposition and a completely different one in government. There is no equivalent provision in this bill to bind the Treasurer to undertake the practice that he required the Labor Treasurer to undertake. Why is there this inconsistency? Why won't the Treasurer subject himself to the standards that the former Labor Treasurer did?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area of the bill that I wish to mention is that of fiscal principles. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the JCPA, has considered the issue of fiscal principles and in report No. 341, paragraph 3.224, it stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Committee does not see a need to formulate binding statutory principles of fiscal responsibility. In any case, such fiscal principles would be so imprecise and so wide open to interpretation that there seemed little point prescribing them in legislation. The Committee is also wary of the idea that there are enduring fiscal principles.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is, this parliament's expert financial committee has said that these principles are meaningless. Whilst we do not oppose these provisions, we note that the insertion of these principles into the legislation is simply window dressing; it will have no practical effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from their generality, the principles of sound fiscal management are seriously deficient in terms of micro&hyphen;economic management, with their singular focus being on financial outcomes. They make no allowance for employment goals, income growth, productivity targets, the income distribution 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7282"> policies of the government or a myriad of other important goals of economic policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the worst example of meaninglessness is principle D, which binds the government to maintain the integrity of the tax system. We know this government has no intention of doing that. For example, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced, by way of press release, in the 1996 budget that the government will not be proceeding with significant anti-avoidance legislation foreshadowed by Labor concerning alienation of personal services income and the avoidance of the PAYE provisions. Those provisions were to be aimed squarely at arrangements undermining the integrity of the personal income tax base, which the tax office confirmed in estimates last year to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, by definition, the Treasurer has already breached his own principles. But, of course, it does not matter if the principles are breached because, as I have already observed, there are no penalties for non-compliance with the bill. So these are the tough new rules, which the government has already broken, for which there is no penalty for contravention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One possible way to strengthen these provisions would be for the tax office and Treasury to make independent annual statements concerning threats to the integrity of the tax system and for the Treasurer to be judged against action to deal with these threats. I will be addressing this issue in more detail during the committee stage. The key issues here, obviously, are resourcing for the tax office and the adequacy of existing legislation to protect the tax base, both of which are squarely within the responsibility of the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now make a few points about the government's record. The first point to make on this bill is the utter farce of the government's stance on the question of budget disclosure and transparency. The long list of government budget broken promises last year make nonsense of any claim to budgetary honesty. The government has literally broken billions of dollars worth of budgetary undertakings which were made prior to the last election.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The no new taxes pledge has been broken repeatedly with tariffs being imposed on hundreds of items previously free of tax. The superannuation tax is clearly a new tax. Families face increased pharmaceutical costs, increased child-care costs and increased state taxation due to the cuts in grants to the states. Students face crippling HECS debts and repayment schedules. The aged will face daily fees for nursing homes and may have to sell their house to pay an up-front fee. Labour market programs have been savagely cut. Industry policy has been ignored as export assistance and other incentives have been cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer to Labor's record. The proposed reporting regime builds on Labor's introduction of much more open and transparent budget processes. For example, we introduced the publication of three-year forward estimates of outlays and revenue, the publication of an annual tax expenditure statement, the massive improvement in the information provided in the budget papers and the publication of financial impact statements within all explanatory material for new legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the rhetoric of the coalition, Labor has the best record of reform of budgetary processes and fiscal disclosure of any Commonwealth government. The excellent record of the previous government in this regard was alluded to in evidence before the JCPA hearing. For example, Professor Mark Robinson stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No legislation can compel fiscal responsibility . . . The most positive view of the Bill is that it is merely the latest in a long series of incremental improvements in fiscal reporting requirements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a fair view of this legislation. It sounds impressive to those not fully acquainted with the minutia of budget policy, but it really delivers very little in concrete terms beyond what has already become established practice under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, I note again that the government is not as interested in budget honesty as it professes. Last year, it omitted significant information previously provided by Labor, including the comprehensive report of the proposed specific purpose payments to the states, which is normally contained in Budget Paper No. 3. This caused difficulties for states 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7283"> in the preparation of their own budgets and severely disadvantaged members of the public and other stakeholders interested in Commonwealth-state financial issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition also raises the canard of asset sales in their own justified assault on Labor's integrity by claiming that we fiddled the books with regard to accounting for asset sales. Nothing could be further from the truth. Labor always followed the appropriate rules and disclosed underlying as well as headline results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite its rhetoric, the government has included significant assets, including property sales of around $1 billion and the recently deferred sale of the telecommunications spectrum, in the so-called underlying budget bottom line even though it vigorously criticised Labor on its similar practice with regard to the issue of asset sales. I think we can also recall the one-third sale of Telstra&mdash;the process of which is continuing at the moment&mdash;and the diversion of a significant proportion of the sale of that asset, effectively, into recurrent expenditure, vis-a-vis the environment fund and the reduction of expenditure in the environment by a figure of $&half; billion in other areas of the budget. If you can redefine, through the sale of an asset, expenditure into the environment as a capital, you can redefine any part of an asset sale proceeds as any part of recurrent expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect to other information, this supposedly honest government continues to refuse to provide, among other things, forecasts of national saving&mdash;notwithstanding the state of centrality of savings to its entire macro-economic strategy. Why won't you provide this key information to the Australian people? Why won't you provide your forecasts of the rate of unemployment in future years to the Australian people? Why won't you publish the economic forecasts of the Reserve Bank, as was promised before the election? The answer to these is obviously that the government is embarrassed by the future forecasts of things like the levels of employment and unemployment, the level of national savings and so forth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pre-election costings regime is seriously deficient in a number of respects. Costings 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of opposition policy can only be undertaken at the discretion of the Prime Minister. This is unbalanced and clearly advantages the incumbent government. Only costings of previously announced policies is allowed&mdash;that is, policy decisions would have to be made on the basis of incomplete information and be announced. The pre-election report requirement also appears to be in need of refinement, for example, by requiring the report to be released earlier than the specified 10 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So whilst the opposition does not oppose this legislation in principle, we are wary of its effectiveness and are also concerned about the fairness of some of its provisions. It should have been more carefully considered by the JCPA. However, this was stymied by the government. I conclude my remarks by foreshadowing now that the opposition will be moving a number of amendments to improve the workings of the bill and to improve the transparency of the budget process.</PARA></SPEECH>

The post-election revelation of the budget deterioration allowed the new Labor government to junk virtually all their election promises. Since then that practice has become pretty much a recurring picture. Governments have deliberately painted a rosier than truth picture of their finances, which only seems to be corrected after elections. Thus, in 1992, Paul Keating produced his now infamous One Nation forecasts, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7284"> which claimed that the deficit would repair itself. On the back of this, he and Dr Hewson went into the 1993 election campaign with the most outlandish and unfunded tax cut promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats said at the time that the tax cuts were not funded and were not fiscally responsible. Democrats leader Senator Kernot moved in the Senate to cancel the cuts on the grounds of fiscal responsibility. But the coalition joined with Labor to vote in the $4 billion of tax cuts which they both knew were not funded. Three years later the coalition had the gall to gloat over the `Beazley black hole'. If they had voted with the Democrats to stop an unfunded $4 billion in tax cuts, there would not have been a black hole; it would have been more like a black divot, to use golfing terminology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last four years, fiscal reporting continued to be a very political process. The 1995 budget included a claimed `headline' surplus of $718 million. The real picture was an underlying deficit of $7.2 billion, a point which Senator Kernot tried to make as clear as possible through trying to set up a Senate inquiry into the matter. Again, the coalition joined with Labor to defeat the Democrats' proposal. Why? Because they wanted to rely on Labor's ridiculously rosy economic forecasts to build up their unfunded and unaffordable election promises&mdash;$7 billion of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the change of government, we had the now familiar display of the new government junking most of their election promises after a shock-horror revelation about the black hole they had helped create. Ignoring the fact that the black hole was always an exaggeration and was mostly accounted for in the 1996 budget papers anyway and that the actual budget deterioration was about $2 billion to $3 billion, the government used this deliberately misleading fiscal crisis to put in place another round of vicious, socially and economically destructive budget cuts, many of which, particularly in business, labour market and social justice areas, were frankly unnecessary. They were so unnecessary that last year's budget ended up $1.6 billion ahead of forecasts. The private sector assessment 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> agency, Access Economics, says that next year's budget will be over $4 billion ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fiscal reporting, while it might seem boring, is absolutely essential to an open and accountable budget process. Once again, I record the Democrats' belief that the government is to be congratulated on recognising that and bringing the bill forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All this manipulation of figures over the past 15 years has resulted in a massive disruption of government service delivery, billions of dollars of broken promises, unfunded promises being made and deceit on a massive scale, undermining public confidence in the electoral process, in politicians' probity and major mistakes in fiscal policy which have affected national economic performance. To combat this, in 1996, Senator Kernot, in her charter for reform, called for far more openness and accountability in fiscal reporting. This bill does go some of the way towards achieving that. In the committee stage we will be pushing amendments to make it go further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill makes the government and the Treasury responsible for reporting to parliament specified information about fiscal strategy, the current economic and fiscal situation and the outlook over the medium and long terms. It specifies principles of fiscal policy that the government is to consider but not necessarily to implement when developing its budgets. The principal effects of the legislation will be: to introduce greater accountability and transparency in matters; to tilt the balance of fiscal decision making away from the short-term economic and political considerations that have dominated the past and instead focus towards strategic and long-term fiscal objectives; and to provide the electorate with an accurate account of the government's financial position and the pricing of its, as well as the opposition's, policies&mdash;all laudable effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The charter of budget honesty seeks to achieve these objectives by requiring the government's fiscal strategy to be based on sound fiscal management and for the publication of regular reports setting out such fiscal strategy. The bill also provides for the publication of an intergenerational report at least once every five years, which it is hoped will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7285"> encourage the development of long-term sustainable and forward government policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation puts in place a number of important accountability mechanisms which will help to ensure that members of the public are better informed about the government's fiscal strategies when they go to the polls and vote in federal elections. It will mean that the electorate will be able to determine more accurately the effectiveness of government in its management of financial affairs and the costs and benefits of government policies. It will mean that the media, who are the prime commentators in the area of election reporting, will be able to do some important and independent analysis. Importantly, it will also be possible for voters to weigh the costs and benefits of government policies against those of the opposition and, if our proposed Democrat amendments get up, other minor parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Charter of Budget Honesty Bill  is largely modelled upon the New Zealand Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994. Most of the reports and analyses proposed in the charter of budget honesty appear to have been taken from the New Zealand act. The exceptions in the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill  are the intergenerational report, the costing of election campaign promises and proposals and the fact that the Australian bill is not binding on the Crown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first two of these provisions have no counterpart in the New Zealand legislation, thus it could be argued that the charter of budget honesty will provide a more comprehensive array of fiscal and economic information than does the New Zealand act. For this the Democrats commend the government. Nevertheless, the Democrats believe that one very important distinction between the New Zealand Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994 and the charter of budget honesty is the fact that, contrary to New Zealand, no rights or obligations arise under the government legislation. This may mean that the so-called advances of the Australian legislation will be cancelled out by this retrograde feature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 3(2) of the bill states that the charter of budget honesty is not judicially enforceable. The charter is therefore much like a code of conduct, which does not have any 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enforcement procedures or penalties&mdash;a situation which clearly is unsatisfactory. Voluntary codes, as we all know, are often ineffective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the current legislation there is no penalty should a party fail to provide pre-election reports and costings, and there is no penalty should a party breach its pre-election reports, costings or commitments. Yet, if you read anything concerning the electorate's view of politicians, you will see that there is an utter need and desire for politicians to speak the truth and to keep their word.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only sanction currently available for when a government ignores the need to comply with the provisions of the charter of budget honesty rests with the parliament. That is an unsatisfactory situation given that the government of the day will have a majority in the parliament. By contrast, the New Zealand Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994 is binding on the Crown. This means that, if the New Zealand government does not comply with the requirements in the act, any citizen has standing to initiate an action in the courts. In our view, this demonstrates a serious commitment to the provision of information and accountability of the government to the electorate&mdash;a commitment which the Democrats and I were disappointed to see was not present in the legislation before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The remedy of enforcement where there is a failure to act is denied Australian citizens in the charter bill, which effectively provides a shield of immunity to any claim on public interest grounds, preventing the disclosure of information. I believe that this limits the effectiveness of the charter as a mechanism to improve scrutiny, transparency and fiscal accountability. Therefore, our most important amendment will be to make this act binding on the Crown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats propose to amend the bill to provide that it be enforceable against the Crown, as in the New Zealand jurisdiction. In the absence of such an amendment, I believe this legislation would be inconsistent with its own purpose: on the one hand, this bill is proclaimed to be an important contribution to the government's accountability efforts; on the other hand, the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7286"> government cannot be held accountable to the provisions in this legislation. I urge the government, the non-government parties and the independents to consider this inconsistency and to support the Democrats' amendment in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill puts in place better public sector accounting methodologies. The current methods provide inadequate information. The fact that these methods have continued to be used points to the politically convenient nature of these provisions in that they provide very little information and consequently could be politically expedient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These poor public sector accounting methodologies are no longer satisfactory. The electorate of today demands that they be provided with sufficient information which will enable them to make an informed vote. This is the right of the elector, and indeed it is the responsibility of the government, the parliament and the Senate to provide the electorate with that information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's accounts must be taken to the next level of international best practice. Setting in place the requirement for pre&hyphen;budget opening of the books and a post&hyphen;budget review of fiscal strategy will make government more open, more transparent, more accountable and more respected by the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats will also be moving amendments to bring about the consideration of social and environmental implications and the effects of policy decisions. These are issues which are vitally important to many members of the community and many future members of the community, and therefore form an essential basis to their voting behaviour and to their lives in Australia. The provision of this kind of information will better assist the electorate in their assessment of the government and opposition parties' policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will also be seeking the support of other senators for the inclusion of a requirement that any costing that is reported includes an indication of the assumptions, limitations and qualifications of any modelling process used in the reports. This should ensure that any biases or distortions which certain models 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> may create will be subject to public criticism, analysis and debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The charter of budget honesty should make a useful contribution to improving policy making, economic sustainability and public accountability in the Australian jurisdiction. The pre-election and post&hyphen;election reports, along with the intergenerational reporting requirements which will assess the long-term sustainability of current government policies, as well as the accompanying reports by the secretaries of the departments of Treasury and Finance, will all contribute to fulfilling the aims of this legislation&mdash;to produce better financial outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bills information requirement should considerably improve the chances of framing fiscal policy debate over a longer term horizon and with a concern for integrating sustainable fiscal policy within wider development strategies. In reviewing these strategies, our Democrats amendments will specifically require social and environmental impacts to be taken into account. I reaffirm the Democrats' approval and gratitude to the government for bringing this bill forward, and I hope that our amendments will result in its considerable strengthening.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R425">Charter of Budget Honesty Bill</XREF>  focuses on introducing accountability along very narrow lines. It should be seen as part of the government's push for the dominance of narrow definitions of `public interest' and `accountability'. My definition of `economics' is related to the origins of the word, but I did not bring that information with me. My understanding is that it is based on the domestic economy&mdash;that is, the way people make decisions about how they live, work and make ends meet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, what we have now is the economy and in fact certain markets telling people what to do rather than people simply using the economy to meet their own needs. If you like, this bill is the epitome of people being told what to do by somebody else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The use of fiscal accountability implies that fiscal benchmarks are the most important or perhaps the only relevant criterion for judging policy. This implies certain values. It pre&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7287"> empts discussions and forces conclusions in certain directions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also reductionist in the extreme. That is, it pulls down the total of social decision making into discrete bundles. It basically looks at short-term outlooks and indicates that it somehow links with other elements within the community. In fact, it does not. Pulling those things apart often gives you a very distorted view of the world. It blocks out the links that are made between taxation decisions and spending decisions with most other elements in society which many other people think are more important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ignores entirely the whole momentum established internationally against such narrow economic accountability. Overseas there has been a great deal of discussion about widening the accounts basis. It talks about integrating environmental and economic accounting and social impacts&mdash;longer term as well as the short term. In reality, if we reduce our productive base, all the accounting in the world with a narrow economic base will not give us any form of truth in terms of outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the original models of the classical economists, production came from the factors of production: land, labour and capital&mdash;natural resources, human resources and invested capital in the modern terminology. The national account structures have tended to concentrate on fixed capital and labour, neglecting natural resources. In accounting terms, income is consumption which does not reduce future consumption possibilities. That is, it does not cut into the asset base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key aim in the national accounts is to measure national income, particularly change in national income. Adjusting the national accounts to take account of resource use is a natural thing to do. Income which undercuts the resource and asset base which produces it is clearly not economically sustainable. That is, if your production poisons and destroys the use of rivers, which are therefore part of the ecosystem and part of the rest of the production base, you are going backwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If part of the national accounts indicates that we have spent a whole lot of money trying to fix up the problems we have created 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with the environment, that should not necessarily be counted as a plus or a growth. If we are depleting the resources at a greater level than that at which we are getting any benefits from them, that should be included. We should have an idea of what the reality is. We should not get to the situation which is happening in the region now, where inappropriate development has suddenly meant huge economic social and health costs because that was not factored into the decision making process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The social effects or social implications could include the changes to distributional equity&mdash;rich and poor regions&mdash;changes likely to affect demographic factors, including rural urban populations, or whether urban neighbourhoods are becoming less diverse, with a population correlating to given incomes. They could include the impacts on demand for employment and availability of diversity of employment opportunities; the impacts on changes to employment in terms of the availability of jobs at various skill levels and the likely results of change to the real value of remuneration for a given amount of work of a certain type. They could include implications for women, youth, the ageing, migrants, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, families or other social groups or classes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you had that kind of information, you would realise why there are extra pressures and more scapegoating when things go wrong. Implications for the future sectors of industry or services include implications for the balance between small and large businesses or between Australian and foreign owned or controlled businesses. There are implications for rural or urban people in relation to employment opportunities, cost of living and access to social, educational service or cultural resources. It is not much good if we have good dollar figures but all of these things are going backwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are implications for the education or knowledge base of Australia's society, including but not limited to implications in respect of access to information or training or teaching or the general state of intellectual culture. There are implications for culture, including the impact on the arts&mdash;visual, literary and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7288"> performance&mdash;affordable access to training and venues, affordable access to events or showings or the implications for development and fostering of Australian culture and the diversity of cultural or artistic productions in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are implications for policies in respect of likely changes to factors which affect the level of crime, poverty, homelessness, disease, suicidal or psychological problems. Once again, when we have dealt with these issues, we tend to look at them in a reductionist sense, not in terms of how they have been affected by other changes, including budget changes. There are implications for the ability of communities to effectively make decisions concerning their lives. This is important. It includes the regulating of activities or the setting of civil goals and acting collectively to pursue them through establishing civil projects under their control, including the implications for the powers, structures, responsibilities and ability to attain revenue for various tiers of government. This all sounds familiar, doesn't it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environmental considerations should include such things as impacts of policy measures on the diversity and integrity of ecological systems, the impacts on natural abundance, the change in the stock of natural wealth, the implications in relation to the conservation of wildlife, species and areas protected as wilderness or unspoiled habitat and sufficient buffer zones to maintain their status as natural biomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environmental considerations should include the implication for the long-term survival of species and assurances that there is enough habitat remaining to allow homes for breeding populations of size sufficient for long-term genetic sustainability. They should include the implication in relation to the provision of parks and areas where people have access to nature for recreational and emotional reasons and for the nurture of the spirit now and in the foreseeable future. They should also include the implications for conservation and sustainable use of natural economic resources, such as soil, forest, rangeland, fisheries and tourist venues in areas of human activity.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environmental considerations should include the implications for the retention of water quality and the abundance of groundwater resources, river and estuarine environments and the quality of near shore waters, including their ability to maintain existing ecological communities. They should include implications in terms of exposure to damaging substances&mdash;that is, pollution in both natural and predominantly human environments&mdash;and the implications of policies which may result in changes of species distribution on a broad and/or long-term scale. This will be important in relation to climate change, and it includes things which may result in the introduction of non-native species or the creation of effectively new species through genetic modification or the creation of selective pressures favouring mutation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environmental considerations should include implications for widespread or long&hyphen;term changes of ecological systems&mdash;that is, the pollutants causing acid rain&mdash;global climate change and oceanic driftnetting. They should also include implications of policies likely to cause changes in non&hyphen;Australian ecosystems, such as the support for the Nam Theun 2 dam and other Mekong&hyphen;Sekong dam projects or measures, including unsustainable logging, that affect trade base in unsustainable exploitation of ecological systems in other nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just recently, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was commissioned to write a report effectively saying that the world as we know it will end if Australia supports greenhouse gas. But it was very narrow. We would like to say that the world is watching Australia in its pathetic attempts to try to use reductionist methods not to link in environmental, the social and the economic considerations. Instead, what they are doing is simply going to certain industries and asking, `What is going to be the effect on you?' without looking at the fact that there is clear evidence that taking positive steps will create more employment rather than less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am saying here is that Australia is going in the wrong direction. I find this  Charter of Budget Honesty Bill  a problem inasmuch as it is suggesting that what the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7289"> government is presenting as far as budget is honest; that what they are presenting&mdash;which is a very narrow view of life&mdash;is actually being honest to the Australian public about what is important, not just now but for the future. That is my problem. There should be honesty about what governments are doing and its effect on our ability to meet our needs in the future, not just in the narrow view of the present. I think there is a problem with the way the whole thing has been constructed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In very brief terms, I will indicate that, in general, I support the intent of the Democrat amendments, although I have some problems with the amendment to bind the Crown. I do not think we should be potentially asking the Senate to add on elements of environmental and social accounting but, first of all, saying that we will bind the Crown no matter what it is they say budget honesty is all about. But we will look at that further during the committee stage. I will also be looking at whether or not the wording is appropriate in all of those amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Australia has to realise that we are in fact part of the planet. Australians are being asked to decide on just about every issue&mdash;social, environmental, educational, aged care and so on&mdash;based on a narrow set of figures which do not necessarily relate to the real picture. They are basically being told that markets far away from them&mdash;speculative money markets in Europe and the United States&mdash;have more power than anyone else in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we have to start realising we are part of the planet, not just part of a speculative money community. There are more and more people in the world saying that there are other values. It is about diversity and it is about people being able to meet their actual needs, not just the needs of a narrow market focus. It is time that we started looking at the actual accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even a true economic rationalist would say you have to take those costs into consideration before you are able to make a market based decision. This is not even included in what the government is proposing and I do not think I want to sign my name to something which, in my view, is dishonest and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> then say we have to make governments stick to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My view is that the role of parliament and the role of the Senate is to present the views of the community as honestly as possible, but to present the views of the community. I do not believe in the recent trend that some view of fiscal restraint should be used to beat people over the head and to rip and tear at the basic fundamentals of life of many people who have no other means of survival&mdash;and then use it as an excuse to further reduce revenue from those people who can afford to provide it. I think there is a real problem with the reductionist nature of this proposal. I have a problem with jumping on the bandwagon of something which, in my view, is patently dishonest.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you to all senators who have contributed to the debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R425">Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996</XREF> . I thank Senator Brown for giving the government a pat on the back for bringing this bill forward. It is an important part of the government's election commitments. The commitment to a charter of budget honesty was a cornerstone of our economic and fiscal policies. When the truth about the state of the books became known shortly after the election of the Howard government we resolved to ensure that the sort of deceit that took place in the 1996 election could never occur again. Our resolve was rebuilt to ensure that this legislation was put in place. We appreciate the contributions of those who have indicated their support for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The core of this legislation is to ensure that the pre-election fiscal and economic outlook is made available to the public, that the public are fully aware of the state of the budget at that time, and of forecasts for the fiscal and economic outlook. The more that the people who vote in elections know about the state of the economy and the state of the books, the more informed judgment they are going to make about the credentials of the parties they are going to vote for. It is wrong for someone to go to a ballot box and cast a vote based on information which is patently incorrect. That occurred at the last election. We were told right through the election, right up to polling day, that the books were balanced and that, in the event that the Howard government was elected, we would inherit a set of balanced accounts. I think there was even some talk about a small surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now history that we inherited an annual average budget deficit of in excess of $10 billion. That has made the government's job in the first 18 months extremely difficult. We have had to deliver budgets which were a lot more difficult to prepare, a lot more difficult 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to deliver and a lot more difficult to get through the Senate than we would have hoped had the Australian Labor Party government under Mr Keating, Mr Willis and Mr Beazley, as the finance minister, been telling the truth to the Australian people prior to the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We inherited deficits run up by the previous Labor government of $70 billion in five years. Most Australians are beginning to realise more and more, because there is more transparency, particularly under this government, of the budget processes, that this money does not grow on trees. You do not just write a bottom line deficit of $10 billion and that suddenly appears out of the clouds or from a tree with money growing on it. It does not magically get delivered from overseas and they do not want it paid back. When you spend $10 billion more than you receive in revenue you have to get it from somewhere. It is borrowed. Next year's budget has to pay back some of the interest on that. Ultimately, when you run up $70 billion worth of cumulative deficits in a period of five years you run up a massive interest bill. So before you spend any money on schools, universities, health care or anything else you pay interest on these loans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legacy that Labor left to Australia in its last five years alone was a $70 billion Bankcard bill. It was called `the Beazley bankcard'. It was a nice way to of trying to get the households of Australia to understand what we did inherit. It is accurate to compare it to a household using their Bankcard or their Visa card or borrowing money in other ways to pay for the household grocery bill. It is no different to any of us going down to Coles week after week, or Woolworths or wherever we shop and saying, `Here is the Bankcard,' and never actually getting around to paying it off. At the end of a couple of years those of us who have run up Bankcard bills or Visa card accounts know that sooner or later you have to pay it back and in the meantime you have to pay interest, and of course that hurts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition is determined to turn that around. We are determined to have a balanced budget through the business cycle. We have brought down budgets which seek to deliver 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7291"> a small surplus by next year. The latest information is that we are on track to achieve that, and we hope we do. I noticed in Senator Sherry's contribution to the debate, which I watched over the TV monitor, that he was talking about this government's dishonesty in breaking election promises. This government has delivered virtually all of its promises. Until Senator Sherry or Mr Beazley or Mr Crean or former Senator Evans come into the parliament and say to the people that they are sorry for what they did to this country, I do not think they will be taken seriously. They certainly will not be taken seriously by this government. We have on the front bench of the opposition people who said: `We are going to deliver l-a-w tax cuts. It was not George Bush saying, `Read my lips'. It was the Prime Minister, a Labor Prime Minister, saying: `These tax cuts are law&mdash;l-a-w, law.' And they never got delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had the Prime Minister prior to Mr Keating, another Labor Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, saying: `There will be no capital gains tax,' and within months we had a capital gains tax. He said, `There will be no increase in the Medicare levy.' There was an increase in the Medicare levy. We had a whole campaign in 1993&mdash;a campaign I will never forget&mdash;where we had we every single minister, Labor minister, running around saying: `You cannot put up indirect taxes. Indirect taxes are terrible for low income earners. We cannot have indirect taxes. We do not want a goods and services tax. We do not want increased taxes on goods.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within days of getting re-elected, Mr Dawkins, the then Treasurer, another Labor Treasurer and a colleague of Senator Sherry's and Mr Beazley's, brings in the biggest increases in indirect taxes in Australian history&mdash;increases of 20 per cent in the prices of some groceries that low income earners across Australia have to pay. There were increases on soft drinks, biscuits, toothpaste, toothbrushes, toiletries, toilet paper and baby products&mdash;increases of up to 20 per cent across a whole range of goods which are used by low income earners across this country, after these people had run around the country scaring them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Act binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment really says: are you really serious as a government; are you really prepared to put yourselves on the line about this matter?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Chairman, I draw your attention to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> No. 85 from the parliamentary information and research services. I must say that, although probably others senators have, I have seldom had the opportunity to thank the Parliamentary Library for the consistent quality of the material they put before us to assist us. This document is yet another example of the very high standard observed by the people and institutions which serve the Senate. So I record my gratitude for that and other past documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my second reading address I spoke at length on this matter of enforceability. This Charter of Budget Honesty Bill provides that the charter of budget honesty does not create rights and duties which are enforceable in judicial or other proceedings. As a consequence, where there is a failure to publish the reports to fiscal strategy required by the charter, there would be no redress in the courts of law or in administrative appeals tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the opinion of the Australian Democrats&mdash;and, indeed, of the New Zealand government when they looked at their own equivalent act&mdash;this is not acceptable. It is contrary to the very intention of the legislation which, briefly, is to provide for much greater accountability of government and opposition in fiscal matters. A Treasury submission to the JCPA&mdash;the joint parliamentary committee&mdash;inquiry into the whole of government reporting and fiscal responsibility legislation in 1995 also raised this point: that there is no legislative requirement for the tabling of budget papers and that the content of the budget papers is the prerogative of the government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explanatory memorandum to the bill offers no explanation as to why no enforceable rights or duties are created by the bill despite the fact that the legislation which it is modelled on&mdash;New Zealand's Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994&mdash;contains just such a provi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sion. The legislation avoids the risk of unconstitutionally restricting the executive power of the Commonwealth through a legislative measure. By not setting targets which governments must meet, the bill makes provision for the executive to follow whatever fiscal strategy it deems necessary, without being fettered in any way by the legislature or the judiciary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must emphasise at this point that I am not interested through this amendment in tying the government in any way to a particular fiscal target. I think that would be unwise. What I do seek to do is to ensure that the government fulfils its obligations to report to the parliament under the charter and that, as is consistent with the principles of accountability in this bill, any person may seek to enforce those obligations, should the government fail to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary library's publication, which I referred to earlier, specifically said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hence the provisions in Sub&hyphen;clause 3(2) of the Bill may be considered to be overly protective of the Executive Government at the expense of Parliament and  the public, particularly as it extends to all aspects of the Charter of Budget Honesty including its fiscal reporting requirements and pre&hyphen;election costings which do not impact on the discretion of the Executive Government in caretaker mode to run the national economy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is from page 9 of that document. On page 10, it goes on to say that the bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . may be better served by building into the Bill the duty and right enforceable in judicial or other proceedings, for the publication of the reports, including  pre&hyphen;election reports and policy costings listed in the Charter of Budget Honesty.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is an independent view, and it is one with which I accord.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I stated in my speech on the second reading, the Democrats have a long history of calling treasurers and their  representatives in the Senate to account for the inaccuracies&mdash;which sometimes have been gross, as is admitted by both major parties in finger&hyphen;pointing at each other&mdash;of the budget forecasts of past governments. If this is any indication of what can occur despite parliamentary scrutiny and despite the ballot box in the past, it is certainly no recommendation for being satisfied with a charter which is less than enforceable. If no&hyphen;one has clean hands 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7294"> and if the previous situation was such that you could not enforce clean hands, the bill as expressed will not allow clean hands to be kept, because it is not enforceable. It was not enforceable in the past, and it will not be enforceable in the future. To a large extent, this fact&mdash;that the bill is not binding on the Crown, in contrast to New Zealand's bill&mdash;is its major weakness. It will, to some extent, gut the very good intentions of the government in bringing forward the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second reading speech, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) simply stated that the effect of the bill would be to enhance the accountability of the present Commonwealth government as well as of future Commonwealth governments. I submit to the Senate that, if this is the true intention of the government, this legislation can only be strengthened by agreeing to this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I expect some members of the Senate to respond to this amendment by saying that, despite the lack of enforceable rights and duties, there is a sanction which rests with the parliament and ultimately with the electorate. I do not disagree that the parliament and electorate do have sanctions. Their problem is that whoever they choose in government has behaved in the same way. That is why they no longer respect the institutions of either the government or the opposition. Neither do they respect the politicians who populate parliament and the Senate. If we can introduce the New Zealand system whereby rights or duties are enforceable, we will go some way to reassuring the electorate that this is not a Clayton's bill; that accountability will genuinely be delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The crucial premise for parliamentary scrutiny and accountability is information. If the government fails to provide pre&hyphen; and post&hyphen;budget statements and intergenerational reports, the parliament lacks the information it needs to call the government to account. It is for this reason that I believe this amendment is the most fundamental one we have put. It is fundamental to the effective workings of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment of ours goes to the very heart of the problem of honesty and accountability. It has been tried and tested in another 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> country with a similar tradition to ours&mdash;New Zealand&mdash;and it has been found to be appropriate, applicable and workable. I would suggest to you that, based on the independent analysis available to us through the parliamentary library and through precedent, this amendment should be accepted by the government parties, the non&hyphen;government parties and the Independents in the Senate. I commend the amendment to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought I would respond to Senator Murray's contribution early in the debate. The government does, as Senator Murray has anticipated correctly, have some concerns with this. We believe that under the Charter of Budget Honesty there will be enormous political pressure to comply with the act. The bureaucracy will have to comply with it, because it will be the law of the land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, compliance will be encouraged by political and community debate about these issues and political and community debate on these issues will, as a result of the charter itself, be significantly enhanced. Senator Murray would have seen the debate that took place during the Western Australian election, for example. These concepts of budget honesty and getting the books opened at an early stage were quite a positive thing in the WA campaign. From my brief readings, in South Australia similar things have occurred where both governments have come out very early, published the books and said, `We will give you accurate costings on all of the policies.' It has put an enormous discipline on oppositions as well. The taxpayer is the winner in the debate when you have the books open because you cannot have the old way of having an auction at the election, where politicians who are bidding at the auction are bidding with the taxpayers' money and they always end up paying. That is the great benefit of it. So the government does believe that debate will be enhanced by this legislative measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, there is a very strong reason for worrying about the fact that the potential for legal disputation could be counterproduc 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7295"> tive. Legal action could be taken in an election in a way that was purely motivated by political purposes. I noted you said `any person'. I presume, under your definition, that when you said any person would have standing in these matters you meant that anyone who wanted to stop the production of these documents or challenge the content of these accounts would have standing before a court. I do not know that this has occurred in New Zealand and I am not personally familiar with the New Zealand provisions; I am sure Senator Kemp and others will have an intimate knowledge of the workings of the New Zealand legislation. I know that those who were closely associated with the production of the policy in this matter, including Senator Brian Gibson during our days in opposition, and who did travel to New Zealand looked at these matters very closely at the time. The people who did put this policy together are aware of that experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can foresee the abuse. Your amendment is very well intentioned&mdash;I have absolutely no doubt about that&mdash;but less well&hyphen;intentioned people could abuse these provisions in a blatantly political way, in a counterproductive way and in a way that is against the intent of this legislation, which is to get information out there to the people of Australia, and to commentators and other economic analysts so that they can analyse these documents and help to inform the Australian people about the state of fiscal affairs. For those reasons, which I think are sound, we will be opposing the amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

Of course, you cannot get a better reason than a practice which has been shown to be working elsewhere, which in this case is New Zealand.

I do not feel that the courts are going to be so irresponsible as to take frivolous actions and turn them into election&hyphen;stopping legal manoeuvres. If there were any effort to do that the public would react badly against the people who were taking the action; after all,

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Charter of Budget Honesty is set out in Schedule 1.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Nothing in the Charter of Budget Honesty creates rights or duties that are enforceable in judicial or other proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The amendment before us is from Senator Murray of the Australian Democrats. It removes that last line about enforceability and submits in its place a new (2), which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Act binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The issue before the chamber is whether the provisions of the Charter of Budget Honesty are enforceable or binding or whether they are not. The government, which has made a great play about this Charter of Budget Honesty, has a bill in which the provisions are not enforceable; the issue for the Senate is whether we make them enforceable. Speaking for the opposition, we will vote for the Democrats amendment to make them enforceable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have a charter for budget honesty but you have a clause which makes it unenforceable, what have you got? Basically you have an illusion of budget honesty, not a charter of it. Or, if you wanted to put it another way and use the contemporary political lingo of this government, you have core honesty and non&hyphen;core honesty: issues that are important and issues that you promise people you will carry through but later deem not to be important and do not carry through. It seems to me to be fundamental that, if you are going to set yourself up in government and enact laws that require honest disclosure, there ought to be a provision to make them reliable and enforceable&mdash;not a hole that you could drive a coach and four through that lets someone off the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7296"> hook. Since this applies in an election context, it may well let them off the hook after the results are in, and the Abraham Lincoln observation that you can fool all of the people for some of the time will have occurred. So the opposition will be supporting this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the broad bill, the government have spoken quite a bit of breast&hyphen;thumping, self&hyphen;congratulatory rhetoric about how they are going to straighten out the process by bringing forward this bill on the Charter of Budget Honesty. What they have in fact done is just this: they have encoded in legislation the practice that we in government followed. They have really not brought anything new to it; what they have done that is different is to put it in a bill. That is not something that we oppose. We support that concept, and we support, and have practised when we were in government, a proper disclosure regime and a proper transparency of what the circumstances are in a Commonwealth budget. This is going to be continued, and it will be continued through a bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has some reservations about some of the provisions here, and we will deal with those when the opportunity for us to move amendments arises. But, in so far as this amendment is concerned, we think it is a well wrought amendment. It is an amendment that actually gives some honesty to the title of the bill by requiring that this act does bind the Crown, and it is therefore acceptable to and supportable by us. I commend it to the committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very difficult issue in some ways, because I do not believe you can legislate for honesty. You can usually guarantee that when you want to portray someone who is wanting to do something shifty, like a used&hyphen;car salesperson, you talk about&mdash;I was going to say `honest John', but I did not really mean to put a specific name to that&mdash;honest Joe's used cars. You will often find that those people who wear that across their sleeves are using it as a smokescreen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am worried about whether, firstly, you can in fact legislate for honesty. You can potentially legislate for accountability but I do not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> know that you can legislate for honesty. What we are in fact doing is leaving it largely to the judgment of Treasury as to what is an honest accounting system, and I do not think we have had much indication from Treasury that they understand the wider issues involved with the depletion of resources and the issues which are in fact important; not irrelevant but vital to whether or not we survive and vital to whether or not we are able to make a living in the future, not just in the present. If we bind the Crown to what I think is a further acceptance of a covert political agenda that economics rules okay and, more than that, that speculative markets&mdash;that is, greed&mdash;rules okay, rather than look at what the total outcomes are, not only are we not legislating for honesty but we are actually legislating for a dishonest approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One specific example that springs to mind is in relation to the sale of assets. We can always put down for this year, next year or even for the next few years what the book value will be for selling off a major public asset. But over time there are other implications&mdash;there is a loss of revenue; there is the loss of control that people have in their own community; and the loss of accountability and so on, which we are seeing the government assisting by saying that industry can have commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence protections, that it does not have to keep people's information private and that, basically, it is only the contracts that can be broken or renewed from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think in that sense we are moving away from honesty. We are actually moving to a position where people know very little about how taxpayers' money is spent, and I have a very strong feeling that, if we are binding the Crown in this particular, illusory bill, we are in fact binding us all to a pig in a poke. We will have the Telstra myth sanctified: whatever the Treasury is asked to come up with in terms of short&hyphen;term outcomes&mdash;for instance, with the sale of Telstra&mdash;is somehow considered to be sacrosanct in that we will form our policies on what is a very narrow view. In my view, that fails to be honest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, although I recognise that there is a desire to look as if this parliament is forcing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7297"> the government to be honest, I come down on the other side by thinking that, if I agree to amendment No. 1, I would be approving of its general intentions when I actually believe that we would be putting into legislation a fundamental dishonesty.

This concerned the implication that, if Labor had had their 14th year in government, all these things would have been done; that we had to wait 13 years for sudden action in the 14th.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I say, with the greatest of respect, that I expect to be treated with courtesy by the chair, because I always show the chair courtesy. Mr Chairman, I am referring to item No. 2 on running sheet No. 664 revised. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Schedule 1, clause 3, page 6 (after line 2), after the definition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Leader of the Opposition</EMPHASIS> , insert:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> minor party leader</EMPHASIS>  means the leader of any party with at least 5 representatives in the Parliament. If the party has representatives in both Houses of the Parliament, the leader is the person nominated by the party's representatives in the Parliament to be the leader for the purposes of this Act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment refers to our desire to include parties in excess of five persons in the parliamentary structure to be included in this process. The Democrats have not done that out of a desire to exclude parliamentary representatives from the process of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R425">Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996</XREF> . We have done so on the basis of a precedent whereby party status is determined in this place at a limit of five. We have assumed that five persons would be therefore acceptable here as a mechanism for the identification of minor parties. Our amendment, item No. 2 on schedule 664, revised, reads:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> . . . minor party leader</EMPHASIS>  means the leader of any party with at least 5 representatives in the Parliament. If the party has representatives in both Houses of the Parliament, the leader is the person nominated by the party's representatives in the Parliament to be the leader for the purposes of this Act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I note that Senator Brown has foreshadowed an amendment, on sheet No. 688, amending our own amendment. I should indicate to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator Brown that I would prefer if that were not moved cognately but subsequently, because if our amendment goes down then, obviously, there is little chance of it succeeding. If our amendment were to succeed, Senator Brown, I would foreshadow to you, to give you some time to perhaps consult with your office, that we would accept that amendment, but with the addition of the words `and also have federal parliamentary representation'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason we do that is that we have been given figures that, since 1911, nearly 500 minor parties have been created in this country. There are a great many minor parties available at any one time. The chances of surviving and, indeed, of getting federal representation are very limited. Because of that, we do not think this approach, whilst democratic and participative in the wider sense, should at this stage be opened completely. I foreshadow that for you, Senator Brown, so that you can consider your position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this clause is to include minor parties in the costing of election commitments. It is consistent with a principle of democracy that parties be able to fully participate in the process. In this way, minor parties may provide the electorate with the costings of alternative election commitments to those of the major parties. This provides the electorate with information and, once again, is an important step towards informing the electorate so that they can vote on the basis of accurate information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would be aware, Mr Chairman, in your capacity as a politician that the Democrats are a minor party; we achieve 11 per cent of the vote. However, we do not have 11 per cent of the resources, 11 per cent of the donations or 11 per cent of the funding that is available to political parties overall. Access to this kind of process would be of extreme assistance to parties such as ours. On the basis that it is our belief that political parties so recognised in the parliamentary process should be able to participate in the charter of budget honesty, and on the basis that it contributes to a better electoral process, I commend my amendment to the Senate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7299"></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="7299" TIME="12.05 p.m." SPEAKER="Cook, Sen Peter" NAMEID="RF4" ELECTORATE="WA" PARTY="ALP" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.05 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am mindful of the fact that the previous amendment before this chamber has just been lost. That was an amendment which required that the provisions of this bill in fact be enforceable. The name of this bill is the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R425">Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996</XREF> . Perhaps now that the provisions of this bill are not enforceable, we could rename it as the optional charter of budget honesty, or the almost charter of budget honesty, because no longer is it necessary to comply with the terms of it if you do not wish. With the removal of enforceability, I am not quite sure what we have got here or what significance the government thinks this bill will have, given the optional nature it now assumes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do note, for the record, that the government used its numbers in order to create the optional character that this bill now assumes. Here they are, on one side of the chamber, bruiting aloud about how they are going to clean up the act of government in Australia and make things more honest but, when you look at the fine print, what have they done? In the fine print, they have made it optional. So you can be optionally honest under this bill that the government has before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the amendment that has just been moved by the Democrats is an amendment that we in the opposition have given some attention to. This amendment is about what is a political party that can have its election promises costed by Treasury and disclosed to electors before an election. The Democrat amendment would have the effect of making the Democrats a party within the meaning of this bill&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MURRAY" NAMEID="3M6">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3M6">Senator Murray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the National Party.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the National Party. I take that worthwhile interjection. They are, in effect, a minor party in their own right. They only assume a larger presence in the political life of Australia because they are in coalition with the Liberal Party. But they are an independent party and they could have their promises independently costed by Treasury.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the cut&hyphen;off line in the Democrats' amendment is for a party of at least five members. I note that in this chamber there are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> two members of the Greens, although they are two separate parties under the heading Greens&mdash;Greens (WA) and Australian Greens, as I understand it. If this amendment were carried, the Greens could not have any of their election promises costed by Treasury within the meaning of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that the Greens have foreshadowed an amendment that would have a wider ranging impact. If the Greens' amendment, which is foreshadowed but not currently before us, were carried then the impact would be that any registered political party in Australia could have their costings made by Treasury. I must say, speaking for the opposition, that I would like to hear a little more argument and a little more justification from both the Democrats and the Greens about their amendments before I could rule on what our position response to them would be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, for guidance sake, let me say that I think it is unreasonable for any political party, whether or not it has members of parliament at all, to access the provisions of this bill and tie up the resources of Treasury in costing whatever promises they make. Let me give you an example. I think in the last ACT election, and it may have been in the last federal election, there was a party registered from which fielded candidates contested the election as the `Sun Dried Tomato Party'. This was obviously a joke party; it was not serious. They seized the election campaign as an opportunity to poke fun at the political system and enjoy themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One could imagine that they would wish to extend the joke and develop, shall I say, idiot policies, submit them to Treasury for costing and have a great guffaw at public expense when the figures came out. I do not think that is desirable. I do not mind them running in an election, but I think dignifying them with anything greater than what they are is not a responsible expenditure of public funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My feeling is that there ought to be some sort of cut-off line. If you have members in the parliament, then you are serious, you have a voting support in the community to put you here, and you have some sort of claim to say, `We are a serious organisation. We're making 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7300"> serious promises. We would like those promises costed.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there may well be a case to lower the threshold figure in the Democrats' amendment from five to one and thus pick up the Independents and the Greens who are in this chamber. But my feeling at this point is not to go any further than that. I note there is no amendment, before us or foreshadowed, that would enable that to occur. I would not mind hearing from the minor parties on this matter a little longer before I finally say where the opposition stands. That is the direction in which we tilt at this point in the debate.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="7300" TIME="12.11 p.m." SPEAKER="Murray, Sen Andrew" NAMEID="3M6" ELECTORATE="WA" PARTY="AD" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3M6">Senator MURRAY</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.11 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the mover of the motion, I will take brief precedence over Senator Brown. It is my assumption&mdash;and perhaps when the government responds to this amendment they can confirm it&mdash;Senator Cook, that if this bill becomes an act and if, for instance, the Labor Party moves back into government, the coalition has a parting of the ways and the Liberal Party becomes the official opposition and the National Party becomes a minor party, the minor party, the National Party, would be excluded from the process of election costing&mdash;that, in fact, they only have access to this costing for as long as they are either in coalition in government or in coalition in opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is a very important point. I do believe the National Party interests have to be considered in this matter. It cannot be automatically assumed that they will always be in coalition with the Liberal Party. If that were so, then they would become a merged party. The fact is that they have a distinct identity. That is the first important point to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second important point I make is that we have accepted in our amendment the precedent that five parliamentary members is the cut-off point to achieve party status. As you know, that party status results in the provision of additional staff and facilities, which assist parties in the exercise of their parliamentary duties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, what I have said is that, with regard to Senator Brown's foreshadowed amendment No. 1, if Senator Brown were willing to exclude parties and independents 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which did not have parliamentary representation&mdash;because there are so many of them and because some of them, frankly, might be regarded as somewhat light&hyphen;hearted about election prospects&mdash;we would certainly have no objection to extending this process and facility to all parliamentary members within both the House of Representatives and the Senate. But, because that is not yet before us, I would prefer that my amendment be dealt with first. I will foreshadow that if Senator Brown did amend his amendment as I have proposed, the Democrats would support it.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="7300" TIME="12.14 p.m." SPEAKER="Brown, Sen Bob" NAMEID="QD4" ELECTORATE="TAS" PARTY="AG" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME><STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.14 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I agree with Senator Murray's proposition that we take his amendment first and then my amendment to that amendment if it is successful. I will be voting for his amendment, which would enable the Democrats' election policies to be assessed for the benefit of the electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My amendment extends to other parties which have representation in this place. As Senator Cook said, that is the Greens (WA), the Australian Greens and the two independent senators, Senator Harradine and Senator Colston, who, if I am not wrong, represent registered parties themselves. It does apply to people in the House of Representatives, as Senator Murray says, who also represent registered political parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would prefer that it was open. I would prefer that anybody standing for election could have their policies scrutinised in this fashion. Let us face it, the cost of policies will lead to some interest and publicity at the time of the election campaigns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As somebody who entered parliament during the Franklin River campaign as an Independent and who has seen the growth of the Tasmanian Greens and then the Australian Greens into a fully&hyphen;fledged national entity, working in parallel with the Greens (WA), I am well aware of the disadvantage to people who want to get into parliament but who do not have parliamentary representation. It is enormous. Estimates at the last election were that if you had a seat in parliament, although election campaigns cannot be run out of offices, it was tantamount to a $50,000 advantage. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7301">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The media takes much more notice of people who are in parliament than people who are not in parliament, unless they are some great celebrity or for some other reason. It means that perfectly legitimate aspirants to the parliament who do not share the views of the bigger political parties are at an enormous disadvantage. That is why I believe that anybody who is bringing forward policies at election time should be able to put those to Treasury to have them scrutinised, to have them evaluated and to have them put before the public for what they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, like Treasury, I can count and I hear the weight of the numbers here, and I know that my amendment as it stands is not going to survive. Therefore, I indicate to Senator Cook and Senator Murray that if Senator Murray's amendment gets up to allow the Democrats and the National Party, along with Labor and Liberal, to have their policies vetted in this fashion, I will accept Senator Murray's amendment. I am looking at having specific words which would carry out the intent of his amendment incorporated into my amendment so that we can extend the potential for scrutiny of election promises beyond the bigger parties to the Greens and to the Independents in this house and in another place&mdash;in other words, to anybody who has shown electoral support in the past or who has had somebody represent them as a party in this parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

I refer to the issue of allowing minor parties to have costings done. These are often very extensive policies. In fact, from time to time, in yesteryear, I used to do a bit of costing of the Democrat policies myself. There was the very famous alternative budget of Sid Spindler, which the Democrats used to bring down in the old days. Both sides of the chamber used to wait very anxiously to see what the Democrat alternative budget would propose. When former Senator Spindler brought that budget down, we eager 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ly rushed forward with the press, grabbed our copies and debate then ensued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think that we have those alternative budgets now. That is a pity. In the light of this new accountability and new exposure, we hope that the Democrats will be bringing down their alternative budget in the coming years so that we can see very clearly what the Democrats are proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I am making is that the Democrat policies, at least from my experience of previous years, are very comprehensive and quite huge. I believe that the costings of those policies would tie up huge resources in the department. Again, it is a matter of judgment just how helpful and practical that would be. Given the tasks that the department already has as a result of the measures in this budget, if we extend that further to the minor parties and to the Greens, we will impose a very substantial burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that Senator Brown is very productive. I do not always agree with him; in fact, I do not often agree with him. If the truth be known, I rarely agree with them. I have no doubt that Senator Brown will be producing a very comprehensive set of policies&mdash;</PARA>

What we are doing in this charter of budget honesty is bringing in new improved accountability, ensuring that the public is properly informed about the policies of the parties which are likely to win government and ensuring that that can be done in a practical manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extension that the Democrats propose, followed by Senator Brown's amendment, simply is not practical. It will tie up huge resources in the department.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to counter the idea that a measure like this should be the prerogative of the old parties. Democracy in Australia is in a very robust and flexible situation. The two-party system is breaking down and new parties are appearing right across the spectrum. I think most Australians like that and

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note from the tone of the contribution of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, that these Treasury assessments can be seen as a positive thing for parties facing election, that they will be wanting to get them assessed. It is a selective thing: you make your choice, put your policy forward and have it assessed. I think the parties are going to want to have that done with policies they reckon can stand the scrutiny, so they come out looking pretty good to the electorate. If that is the case, why should that advantage not be given to the Australian Democrats, the Greens or other entities standing for election?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Senate is not going to accept my proposal that all parties facing the Australian electorate should be able to have their policies scrutinised in this fashion, I think that at least the notion of democracy, the evaluation that every vote is equal and the right of everybody to vote for other parties and to vote away from the government of the day ought to at least enable parties which have a presence in the parliament to have their policies scrutinised in this fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand the argument that Senator Kemp is putting forward, but on democratic terms it does not stand the rigour of analysis.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that we are moving into a degree of farce. We have not yet hit high farce, but we are in partial farce at this stage. I say that because we have just had the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7303"> government use its numbers to vote down a requirement in this <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R425">Charter of Budget Honesty Bill</XREF>  that there be enforceability. So now this bill is optional&mdash;we can have optional honesty. Also, we now have had a very well crafted question from the Australian Democrats to the government about the National Party. The answer is that the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition refer their party promises for costing by Treasury. But, as the bill is now set, the National Party in fact is excluded from doing so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know, particularly us in the Labor Party, that in an election the Liberal Party appeals to a certain part of the Australian electorate, and the National Party&mdash;the former Country Party&mdash;appeals to another set of the Australian electorate. But in government they govern as one party, as a coalition. If the Prime Minister chooses, he would refer only the policies of his party, as the majority coalition partner, for costing. Therefore, the extravagant promises that are often made by the National Party to rural Australia would escape costing and scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this bill proposes that the true cost of the promises made by political parties at an election be honestly disclosed, then all the political parties should be costed. It should not be just one party, the Liberal Party, and another party, the Labor Party, because then you could not judge what the true cost of a coalition&mdash;between the Liberal Party and the National Party&mdash;might be to the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is now farcical because you are saying, `It suits us to exclude our junior coalition partner.' I have to say to the government that you have embarked on this course, you have thumped your chest about a new order of government accountability to the people&mdash;all laudable things and good things to say&mdash;but, when one turns to the fine print of what you are proposing, it collapses like a house of cards.

I asked my constituent: `What on earth could you possibly mean?' But allow me to explain.

Senator Sherry, I submit, kept the guilty silence hoping the issues would pass. Why did Mr Crean give false information to defend Senator Sherry? Has Senator Sherry told Mr Crean that he was wrong? Why did Mr Crean say `Senator Sherry doesn't own a house'? The Register of Senators' Interests discloses that Senator Sherry does have a home office. A title search reveals that he owns 3 Hale St, Burnie. Given that this information is on the public record, why did Mr Crean say `Senator Sherry doesn't own a house'? Is it because Senator Sherry brags about the fact he doesn't have a house? Is it because everyone in the Labor Party knows that the home bit is a sham, and Mr Crean accidentally let the cat out of the bag? I am sure, if questioned, the honourable member for Hotham will use his rival for the top job's well-known excuse: `It seemed like a good idea at the time'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record, Senator Sherry, in fact, owns two houses, including one in Canberra. On 27 September in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advocate</EMPHASIS> newspaper, Senators Sherry and Denman advertised `Labor senators' office' at 3 Hale St, Burnie. I have a copy of that advertisement in case any honourable senator wishes to see it. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7307"> advertisement proudly displays the office telephone number, the same one in the phone book.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming back to my constituent, he was full of consternation that the two senators were sharing this two- storey terrace house office. `Well', the constituent gasped, `but they are airing a double mattress on the verandah of the first floor'. I quickly assured him that Senator Denman would adhere to a strictly downstairs only policy. The constituent kindly photographed the office home and sent the photographs to me. Given that the bottom floor is office space, the living area must be minuscule. I have photographs of the home office, which clearly show the double mattress being aired on the first floor verandah, and a side shot of the home office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A side shot of the house reveals not only the lack of depth to the house, confirming that it is very small, but that Senator Sherry likes the company of used caryards&mdash;which are proudly displayed next to the side of Senator Sherry's house. He undoubtedly feels at home with them. One can understand that there would be an affinity between them. But no, I am wrong. He doesn't feel at home. That is why he does not bother even putting the bed inside his home&mdash;because he does not stay there. That is why he has been giving the travel allowance such a touch along&mdash;because if he did stay at Burnie it might stand to reason that the bed would be indoors. The public display of a bed on the verandah did not convince the citizens of Burnie that you actually live in Burnie, Senator Sherry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not criticise Senator Sherry for owning two houses. In fact, I applaud him, and well done. But what I cannot applaud is his guilty silence when coalition MPs are attacked for staying overnight in family homes. For the record, Senator Sherry claimed 420 days travel allowance in Canberra between 22 March 1993 to 24 February 1997. That equals about $58,800. My colleague the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) has publicly stated how Senator Sherry claimed, while staying at his mother's, a total of $43,320 for the equivalent period. Let me say on the record: the rules allow this to occur. But it is a bit rich attacking a coalition member for engaging in a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> similar practice, egging the attacks on, when you yourself are engaged in the same activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lesson for the opposition is that people have a severe distaste for gross hypocrisy. If you hypocritically attack someone, your own details will be disclosed by feelings of justifiable righteous indignation. Senator Sherry, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, the people of Canberra and of Opossum Bay are reviled by Labor's two-faced approach on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst acknowledging that Senator Sherry is technically allowed to stay at his mum's place, I want to visit the extent of Senator Sherry's travel allowance claims. I must say that Senator Sherry's chairmanship of the superannuation committee was very uneventful, except for one thing. You have guessed it: his TA claims. In all, he claimed some 62 days. I have to say that his successor was somewhat more moderate in his claims. But Senator Sherry will say that he was busy. Fine, then let us see where he was busy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Guess what? Although there was only one day of official hearing of his committee in Hobart, Senator Sherry claimed for 10 nights in Hobart. Undoubtedly, he was furiously taking counsel from all the doyens of the superannuation industry who live in Hobart. However, his problem is that he was continually criticised for his lack of consultation. Ten days would allow you to talk with every agent and, for that matter, every policy holder in Hobart and still have time to spare to talk to your hairdresser about superannuation. Yet, the senator remains so blissfully ignorant about superannuation matters. I wonder if the honourable senator claimed travel allowance for his consultations in the barber's chair as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the ludicrous nature of the claims is that he spent more time allegedly on superannuation in Hobart than he did in Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane combined&mdash;combined. Are you really going to tell the people of Australia that there is a little hotbed of superannuation knowledge in Hobart which far exceeds the combined knowledge and wisdom on superannuation that resides in Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane? The ring of truth, credibility, is absent when the figures are analysed. No 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7308"> city in Australia other than Sydney got such an overwhelming dose of consultation on superannuation matters as did Hobart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this love affair with Hobart continued when Senator Sherry became the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. He enjoyed that position between 24 March 1993 and 11 March 1996. Senator Sherry, during that time, claimed for 652 days of travel allowance. Of those, 315 were in Canberra and 125 were in Hobart. Altogether for Tasmania he claimed 160 days; that is, 47.5 per cent, or nearly half, of his non-Canberra claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With that degree of consultation in Tasmania, Senator Sherry should have understood his portfolio responsibilities; unfortunately, he did not. With that amount of time, he would have had the time to not only speak with every stakeholder in the forestry and aquaculture industry; he also would have had the time to speak to every tree, fish, cow and sheep in Tasmania&mdash;and, of course, we know that he did not devote himself to his duties for which he claimed his parliamentary travel allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday Senator Sherry told this chamber, `I spend the majority of my time in Burnie, and I travel as required.' For the record, Senator Sherry was parliamentary secretary, as I said before, between 24 March 1993 and 11 March 1996&mdash;let us say about 1,080 days. Yet we know he claimed 652 days for travel allowance; that is, 60 per cent of his time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I submit that Senator Sherry has misled the Senate. At best, he could have only stayed in Burnie for 40 per cent of the time. But for Senator Sherry, shadow spokesman for finance and superannuation, 40 per cent is a majority. No wonder we had a $10.3 billion deficit under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, Senator Sherry told us, `Anything my minister, Bob Collins, asked me to do for him, I did, no matter what it required.' It is now obvious: Senator Collins told him, `Stay at your mums's or stay in Canberra; the vast majority of the time stay out of the rest of Australia, hide yourself in Tasmania or in your office in Canberra; we do not want to see you out in the electorate amongst the mainlander constituency because you will undoubtedly lose votes for us.' But if you are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> honestly trying to suggest to us that Senator Collins told you to spend such a vast amount of your time on primary industry matters only in Tasmania, I have to say to you that I doubt it, and I also doubt that Senator Collins would come into this chamber and say, `I told Senator Sherry to spend so much time in Tasmania on these issues.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we came to government, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you well know, the issues of the aquaculture industry were not fixed; the forest industry was not fixed. We fixed those within the first 18 months of our government. If there was a common theme going around amongst the stakeholders, it was that Senator Sherry had not consulted or listened to them. We did; we fixed up the problems. I submit that Senator Sherry has a lot of explaining to do, in connection with his claims for travel allowance, as to why he had this fascinating love for Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Deputy President Calvert, as you come from Tasmania, as do I, you would find it very rich that Senator Sherry has the audacity from time to time to make allegations that the north&hyphen;west coast of Tasmania is not adequately serviced. He has this pretence, this absolute pretence, of having a home in Burnie which has now been exploded away, absolutely shot away&mdash;not by us, but by Mr Crean, the member for Hotham. Mr Crean unwittingly let the cat out of the bag by stating what everybody in this place knows, what everybody in the ALP knows: that Senator Sherry does not count Burnie as his home. Why else would Mr Crean have said to the Australian people, `Senator Sherry does not own a home.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry, if everybody in your party knew that you were based in Burnie, that you lived in Burnie, why would it be that Mr Crean would say, `He doesn't own a home, and that explains his huge travel allowance'? The only defence offered by Mr Crean was that Senator Sherry does not own a home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry on his own admission says, `That assertion is wrong'&mdash;he is nodding his head in agreement. Therefore, the only defence proffered on your part, Senator Sherry, by Mr Crean has been knocked out, knocked away and dispelled as an untruth. As a result 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7309"> you have been left with no defence whatsoever for your high travel allowance claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that Senator Sherry is the next speaker in this debate. I look forward to his explanation, as, I am sure, the vast majority of Australians do as well.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7309"><TITLE>Travel Allowances</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there is one truism in politics it is that if you are dishing it out you have to be prepared to cop it. So, with three ministers gone, two highly placed prime ministerial staffers sacked and public servants being stood down or resigning, it is no surprise to me that I am the target of retaliation. What I find pathetic is the insubstantial and blatant lying that is going on at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first step in the coalition campaign was to circulate an anonymous scandal sheet to the press gallery last Friday. Just to prove that they cannot get their facts right, they alleged that I live in Devonport. Well, I have got news for my mate Simon Crean and my enemy Mr Peter Costello&mdash;I own a home and live in Burnie. The coalition got it wrong. This scandal sheet went on to ask why I was on the Gold Coast so frequently&mdash;note that they have dropped this line now&mdash;but I have been able to readily produce evidence that I was on official business on each occasion. I can hardly be held responsible for the fact that many of these primary industry bodies use the Gold Coast as a venue for their conferences. No wonder no journalist is interested in that line any more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Costello, in answer to a question on Monday which had nothing to do with travel allowance, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is one name that is talked about . . . when it comes to claiming travel allowances in this parliament: Senator Nick Sherry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to detail my 1995 claims. Leaving aside the fact that, in order to manipulate the figures he uses a calendar year reference rather than a financial year reference, as is usual, it is true that in that year I claimed TA on 66 per cent of nights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet what does Mr Costello say about his colleague the Minister for Veterans' Affairs 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (Mr Bruce Scott), who in the first nine months of government claimed 80 per cent of nights on TA? This from a minister who aspires to promotion in the cabinet. This is the minister who, in a statement to the House yesterday, said that all of his claims were made in good faith and within the spirit of the guidelines. This from a minister who then went on later in the day to water down even that tepid defence and to say that his travel claims were free of deliberate and systematic error. Yet this is the minister who will not answer specific allegations, the minister who waffles on in general terms. I, on the other hand, am willing to respond to any specific allegation of abuse. You specify the day and I will specify the nature of my claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the coalition campaign did not stop there. Senator Kemp, in answer to a question on charter travel, found himself unable to comprehend the question, as usual, let alone answer it. So he directed an attack on my TA claims. Like his coalition colleagues, Senator Kemp made no specific allegations. When challenged by way of a supplementary question to detail even one claim for TA which he believed to be incorrect, he too merely waffled for a minute as he usually does and then sat down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, when on the noting of answers he was given five minutes to raise even one specific allegation against me, he failed to do so. But you have to say that the reactionary member for Braddon, Mr Miles, unlike his coalition colleagues, has at least made one specific allegation. In a press release issued yesterday, he alleges that I have claimed TA at the wrong rate. I assert to the Senate that each one of my Hobart TA claims meets the requirements as specified in the Department of Administrative Services guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Miles went on to query whether I stayed at Opossum Bay. He claims that Opossum Bay is not part of Hobart. The DAS guidelines set rates for capital city claims. The guidelines state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Capital city is as defined (in relation to its boundaries) by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Australian Bureau of Statistics definition states that:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7310">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The greater Hobart division comprises the local government areas of Hobart, Glenorchy, Clarence and Brighton and the predominantly urban parts of Kingborough, New Norfolk and Sorell. The division is Tasmania's principal, regional and administrative focus.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In addition, in response to a query from my office, the Department of Administrative Services confirmed some 3&half; years ago that Opossum Bay, in the city of Clarence, was within the Hobart travel allowance claim area. To argue any differently is to argue that Parramatta is not part of Sydney, Dandenong is not part of Melbourne and Port Adelaide is not part of Adelaide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Miles challenges me to answer the allegations in his press release. I have done so here and I am pleased to acknowledge that Senator Abetz, in reference to this matter, acknowledges `that the rules allow this to occur'. Thank you, Senator Abetz.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that said there was no case to answer in the Colston matter. This is a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who said that the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) had his immense confidence and full support. This is a government in which the former Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Peter McGauran) thrice asserted that his claims were valid. On the basis of evidence to the contrary, they have all gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now return to Senator Abetz's photographic evidence of my home in Burnie, to set the record straight and make it very clear. I purchased the double story terrace in Burnie approximately 3&half; years ago. I know it well because I spent approximately a month redecorating it from top to bottom. In the bottom part, in the front two rooms, at personal expense I locate a private electoral office. I live in the living room, the bedroom and the kitchens at the back of that terrace property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Senator Eric Abetz, I say to all the members of the government, I say to the press gallery: when I return to Burnie on Friday to go to the Burnie show and spend the next week or two on the north&hyphen;west coast, you are all welcome to come and visit my home in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Burnie and see my office in Burnie. They are both in the same terraced house.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I established an additional Burnie office, at personal expense, was in order to improve the service requirements on the north&hyphen;west coast of Tasmania. My electoral office is in Devonport. Unfortunately, on the coast, people from Burnie will not travel to Devonport and vice versa. So I made a commitment to open, at personal expense, an electoral office in Burnie, at 3 Hale Street. It is a property I own and it is staffed by one of my three electoral officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not dissimilar to what Mr Miles and Senator Watson have done. Mr Miles and Senator Watson have rented a property in Devonport and share staff arrangements. I note Mr Miles's wife works for Senator Watson. But I am not going to get into that sort of dirt; I am not going to get into that sort of area. I am going to stick to the facts. Let us stick to the facts. What I have done in Burnie is fundamentally no different from what Senator Watson and Mr Miles have done on the north&hyphen;west coast of Tasmania to improve service to the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I enjoy the north&hyphen;west coast of Tasmania. I love it. Unfortunately, there is a used car yard next to my office and my home in Burnie and, unfortunately, there is a great big woodchip pile in front of it. When I go out onto the verandah of my living quarters, I do see that big woodchip pile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the phone number, I have here the north-west coast phone directory. It says: Senator Nick Sherry, 3 Hale Street, and the phone number is 64319986. I also have another number, which is not published, 64319809.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week in this place, we witnessed an unjustified and undignified attack on one of Australia's eminent economists. The Democrats are well aware that, when a government lacking leadership is in disarray and it flounders, it resorts to underhand and dishonest attacks on parties and individuals. Indeed, with this government, it is becoming more and more obvious that if one dares to disagree&mdash;whether an individual or an organisation&mdash;the first thing that you usually face is defunding. If they cannot get you that way, then it is simply dismissal or denigration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what we witnessed in here last week during one of the question times was one of Mr Howard's greenhouse henchmen&mdash;the fossil fuel apostle, Senator Warwick Parer&mdash;struggling to justify this government's foolish climate change position. Senator Parer, who is incapable of attacking the strong arguments against the federal government's shoddy greenhouse record, used parliamentary privilege to attack one of his government's eminent critics on this issue. But Senator Parer did not or could not attack this man's economics; he attacked his spirituality. Senator Parer vilified Dr Clive Hamilton, Executive Director of the Australian Institute. Why? Because, like many Australians, Dr Hamilton believes that the government's greenhouse gas stance is irresponsible and built on shonky research and shonky figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Clive Hamilton is not one of the Howard style economists&mdash;those who believe in the quick buck mentality and who would happily pummel everything and anything in their way&mdash;whether it is the environment or people&mdash;for a short&hyphen;term economic gain. Rather, Dr Hamilton sees economics in terms of the big picture. He recognises that jeopar 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dising the environment to fill a few fossil fuel pockets is not the sort of mentality which will secure the planet for future generations, and this is where Senator Parer has a problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the benefit of senators who may not be aware of Dr Hamilton's expertise, I will fill you in from his CV. Dr Hamilton is founder and Executive Director of the Australia Institute, a non&hyphen;profit public policy research centre. He is a visiting fellow at the ANU and an adjunct professor at Sydney's University of Technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Hamilton, who is trained in maths and economics, has filled a number of positions and they include: senior executive in the Prime Minister's portfolio as head of research in the Federal Resource Assessment Commission; senior economist in the Federal Bureau of Industry Economics; senior economic adviser to the government of Indonesia; and Director of the Graduate Program at the National Centre for Development Studies at the Australian National University. He has served as a member of the United Nations Group of Experts on Least Developed Countries and, this year, Dr Hamilton addressed delegates at climate change negotiations in Bonn. He has been invited to act as a keynote speaker at many prestigious conferences. He has published four books, and is a widely experienced and respected lecturer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Underlying all of Dr Hamilton's work has been the credo of the Australia Institute, and that is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to promote a more just, sustainable and peaceful society through research, publication and vigorous participation in public debate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The aim of the institute is to restore a balance between economic efficiency and considerations of the community, environment and ethics. I think that honourable senators will agree that Dr Hamilton's curriculum vitae is exemplary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the midst of his manic diatribe last week, Senator Parer offered Australians his own guidance on who we should believe on the issue of greenhouse gas economics. He suggested that the public listen to ABARE, the apologist for all polluting industries, whose macro&hyphen;economic modelling has been  bucketed 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7312"> by all and sundry&mdash;and I am talking about nationally as well as internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Was Senator Parer seriously telling people to listen to ABARE, whose chief, Brian Fisher, last year, told the Royal Institute of International Affairs that allowing small island states of the Pacific to be inundated with rising sea levels&mdash;and for us then to be involved in relocating their populations&mdash;while industrial nations did nothing about greenhouse, may be the most economically efficient way of dealing with climate change? Was he seriously telling people to accept the ABARE models, which use wildly fanciful bases for their assumptions, such as a nonsensical $900 a tonne carbon tax? These are models which, I must say, are now being investigated by the federal ombudsman and, as we all know, are substantially funded by the fossil fuel industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No. I think people would much rather consider Dr Hamilton's reasonable, rational and responsible economics. So let us look at some of the other people that Senator Parer considers the public should be listening to instead of Dr Hamilton. There is the good senator himself. Senator Parer is a former coal industry chief, who thought gas was not a fossil fuel, a resources minister who shrugged off the greenhouse effect numerous times, and who laughed off rainfall changes as being helpful to farmers. These are comments which show not only how frivolous he thinks the debate is but how little he knows about climate change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the rest of the world is working towards a solution, Senator Parer still does not seem to believe that there actually is a problem. Indeed, he is on the record as saying that greenhouse issues will be forgotten in 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps Senator Parer would like people to listen to his other colleagues. There is Senator Ian Macdonald, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment&mdash;and I am look at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 26 November 1996&mdash;who had to be reminded by Senator Kernot about the difference between the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps we should listen to that international giant, Mr Alexander Downer&mdash;if we are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> going to talk about personalities, we should mention that he has even been photographed wearing fishnet stockings&mdash;who is telling the rest of the world, seriously, that Australia should be allowed to boost its greenhouse gas emissions. What a position to take off to the international conference in Japan at the end of the year. When the rest of the world is sitting around the table looking at how we can come to terms with this problem, and constructively deal with it, we have a minister who is seriously suggesting that we go to that conference with the basic premise that we, Australia, want to be out of step with everybody else and boost emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about some of the other people your government endorsed at the recent so&hyphen;called `Pre&hyphen;Eminent International Conference on Climate Change'? There was US Senator Malcolm Wallop&mdash;who makes Pauline Hanson look like a moderate&mdash;and US Senator Chuck Hagel. I will give some of the background of both of them. Before his political career, Malcolm Wallop jointly ventured oil and gas development projects in Nebraska, Montana and Wyoming. The efforts of these men to derail global greenhouse undertakings in the United States are very well documented. Are these the people that Senator Parer is seriously asking us to put ahead of Dr Hamilton? Really, Senator, I would argue that the credentials on your side of this debate are seriously lacking. Disreputable models and disruptive advisers do not add up to good greenhouse policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Parer also has&mdash;I hope, like most of us&mdash;now seen a statement by professional economists on climate change. Like Dr Clive Hamilton, these economists are arguing that Australia has to do something. I seek leave to incorporate a statement by professional economists on climate change. It is a one&hyphen;page statement accompanied by three pages of names.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A STATEMENT BY PROFESSIONAL ECONOMISTS ON CLIMATE CHANGE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. A report by over 2000 distinguished international scientists under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has determined 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7313"> that `the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate'. As economists we believe that global climate change carries with it significant environmental, economic, social and geopolitical risks and that preventive steps are justified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Economic studies have found that there are many potential policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for which the benefits outweigh the costs. Policy options are available that would slow climate change without harming employment or living standards in Australia, and these may in fact improve Australian productivity in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The economic modelling studies on which the Government is relying to assess the impacts of reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions overestimate the costs and underestimate the benefits of reducing emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Economic instruments&mdash;such as carbon taxes and trading of emission permits within and between countries&mdash;will be an important part of a comprehensive climate change policy. `Joint implementation' policies, in which Australian firms carry out emission-reduction investments in developing countries,  can  also  play  a  significant  role. Revenues 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> raised from taxes or the sale of permits can be used to reduce the budget deficit or to lower existing taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. Developing countries will need to take measures to reduce significantly their greenhouse gas emissions in due course. But since OECD countries are responsible for over 80% of increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and are in a stronger economic position to reduce their emissions, they should take the lead in cutting emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. An appropriate equity and efficiency principle for the distribution of the emissions reductions is one where countries which are responsible for high per capita emissions and which are more wealthy should do more to reduce their emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. Withdrawal from the Framework Convention on Climate Change could seriously harm Australia's long-term economic and diplomatic interests. It would be damaging to our longer-term economic interests if Australia became locked into a fossil-fuel based economic structure while the rest of the world shifts to low-emission energy sources over the next decades.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to raise important issues with regard to the state of health in Northern Territory Aboriginal communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst many of the programs and government initiatives, at both the territory and Commonwealth level, have improved the health of Aboriginal people over the years, the results are still unacceptable. The problem is complex and difficult to solve. The federal coalition government and the Country Liberal Northern Territory government have put in place successful programs such as the strong woman, strong baby, strong culture program; a food and nutrition audit; living with alcohol programs; and the Northern Territory food project aimed at educating and improving the health of Aboriginal people. But still, unfortunately, many health problems continue to exist in Aboriginal communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A fundamental and vital factor affecting the health of Aboriginal people in these communities is diet. The food eaten, the amount of alcohol consumed, the decreased use of traditional bush tucker, the high level of sugar and many other dietary influences contribute to the poor overall health in many communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A major influence on the diet and health of people in Aboriginal communities is always and inevitably the community store. Lee, Bonson and Powers, from the Menzies School of Health Research, comment in a journal article entitled `The effect of retail store managers on Aboriginal diet in remote 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> communities' that, in many Aboriginal communities, there is only one community store providing over 95 per cent of the total dietary intake and&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . one way to avoid arbitrary variations in store managers' individual ordering patterns, and to ensure that the food supplied reflects both community preference and nutritional needs, is to implement a store food and nutrition policy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This makes the role of a store in the community vital to the ongoing health of the community. No adequate competition exists to provide alternatives in pricing and, perhaps even more importantly, nutritional and choice values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my belief that, in many communities, Aboriginal residents are being badly let down by the managers and management committees of their community&hyphen;owned stores. The best interests of the community are not being served by proper responsibility or accountability. Unfortunately, in a significant number of cases, the mismanagement of community stores involves both financial and health policy concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One recent review by me of a community store at Maningrida&mdash;which has an annual trading revenue of about $4 million in shop sales and about 1,000 people living in the community&mdash;shows that, for three consecutive years, there were qualified auditors' reports stating that the gross profit margins were not consistent with expected results, based on the set mark&hyphen;up percentages. In fact, growth profit margins were well below what was expected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In plain English, this means that either cash was being taken out of the till or stock was walking out of the door unpaid for. I am concerned about the huge rip&hyphen;off of cash and stock, and the resultant honesty and competence of management, in stores of this size. Stores in Aboriginal communities cannot continue to face cash misappropriations&mdash;like the $150,000 at Maningrida&mdash;or hundreds of thousands of dollars in stock losses each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The profits of these community stores should be going back directly into the community by way of dividends for residents and improved community services. This is a legal and, more importantly, a moral obligation. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7318"> Managers of stores, and their management committees, must ensure that there is no financial mismanagement or stock loss that deprives the community of what is rightfully theirs. Profits from these stores must be used to improve the wellbeing of the people and lift their standard of living, not line the pockets of rip&hyphen;off merchants, unscrupulous managers or selected members of the community. They should be providing money for education, cultural events, training and sporting events, and things that keep a community alive, healthy and active.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many Aboriginal community stores the problems are compounded: stock disappears at an astonishing rate without being paid for; large sums of money are fleeced; and the nutritional value of foodstock is very low. Aboriginal communities must address this unfortunate financial situation if they are to gain true self&hyphen;determination. It is a situation I wish to continually highlight but, unfortunately, do not have sufficient time today to dwell on it in this particular speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather, I wish to concentrate on the poor nutrition in Aboriginal communities. The saddest and most shocking aspect of the problem is that, in many cases, a poor diet does not affect those consuming that poor diet. In many cases, such as those of expectant mothers, it can affect the unborn child in later life in many ways such as low birth weight, stunting of growth, subsequent learning problems at school, immune deficiencies and high rates of hospitalisation, morbidity and mortality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A cycle of poor nutrition before birth leads to poor health in childhood and adult life. Repetition through generations must be broken. Nutrition is one piece of the health puzzle, and a very important one. Improving nutrition would go a long way to addressing the shocking health problems in Aboriginal communities. I must stress that stores in Aboriginal communities do have a vital role in the health of the community, and that there are success stories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me cite the example of an extremely successful Aboriginal group operating stores in the Northern Territory. The Arnhem Land Progress Association, commonly known as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ALPA, has been trading successfully for 25 years, and is an exceptional example of an Aboriginal cooperative retailer. Their financial accounts for the year ended 30 April 1997 show a trading turnover of $14 million and a  gross profit of over $4 million in their own stores. Compare this with my earlier example of the poorly operated community store at Maningrida!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ALPA itself has stores in five Arnhem Land communities. These are: Minjilang, known as Croker Island; Galiwin'ku, or Elcho Island; Gapuwiyak, or Lake Evella; Ramingining; and Milingimbi. They also provide management assistance to the communities of Warruwi, Belyuen, Umbakumba and Lajamanu in the Northern Territory, and Turkey Creek and Noonkanbah in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ALPA is owned and controlled by Aborigines. Its board meets every three months and all policy decisions regarding ALPA are made at these meetings. The board consists of 18 Aboriginal directors from the five member communities and includes the board chairman, the Reverend Djiniyini Gondarra, along with five council chairmen representing their various communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is this Aboriginal control and a strong, clear positive mission statement giving directions that accounts for ALPA's success. I will quote from their mission statement which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ALPA's mission is to conduct an efficient retail business emphasising customer service, nutrition and staff development, training and education. ALPA strives to enhance the social and economic development of its members. Giving primacy to their cultural heritage, dignity and desire for equality with their fellow Australians.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The emphasis on staff development, training and education has led to the vast majority of store workers being Aborigines who receive training in all aspects of store work. We are seeing people who live in the community, and the community itself, benefiting from the opportunity for employment, increased education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The control over decision making processes with regard to their stores and the opportunities they present empowers the community 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7319"> and raises self&hyphen;esteem in the individual and pride in the community. Coupled with a good nutrition policy and sound management, this can only enhance a community&mdash;and it is important that people realise this importance. The promotion of the health of the community is something that the store should play a major role in and accept responsibility for, particularly with regard to nutrition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ALPA has a strong nutrition policy that includes programs such as ensuring an ample supply of fresh fruit and vegetables, satisfying the dietary needs of diabetics and employing Good Food people in each store to help make this policy work. ALPA subsidises the full cost of the freight on fruit and vegetables, a significant amount of which has to be air&hyphen;freighted into the communities. This is made possible by charging a levy on cigarettes&mdash;perhaps a very good idea which many other stores in the Territory, not just those in Aboriginal communities, should consider adopting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you walk into an ALPA store you will see fresh fruit prominently displayed, not just the junk and fatty food and pink lemonade that stares you in the face in so many other community stores. The takeaway arms of ALPA shops are replacing foods high in fat with other healthier alternatives and are also making available stews and steamed and fried rice, and promoting fruit juices and diet drinks instead of sugared soft drinks. Simple decisions and leadership examples are quite easy to implement and will have a measurable impact on the health of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have recently written letters to all community store managers, school principals, health workers and ATSIC regional councillors in the Northern Territory seeking their views and advice. With the help and advice of the Northern Territory Department of Health, I am hoping that the nutritional value of the stock in some Aboriginal stores can be vastly improved, with a subsequent improvement in the health of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government is also taking important initiatives to improve Aboriginal health. The national plan to monitor indigenous health is another example of the federal coalition government taking strong action to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> address a problem. Instead of relying on rhetoric and little result, as Labor has done with regard to so many problems, particularly Aboriginal health, we are seeing the government require all health workers to report  against a set of national performance indicators and targets to lift the health status of the indigenous population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The setting of clear targets that are appropriate for different circumstances experienced across different regions of Australia, along with improved reporting and evaluation, is another important step by the federal government in improving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. The targets we have set include: a reduction by 50 per cent in the death rate for infants and by 20 per cent in the overall death rate over 10 years, and an increase in immunisation and vaccination for key conditions. An example is the target of achieving 95 per cent of Aboriginal people immunised against hepatitis B in two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benchmarks are important as they set clear objectives for state and territory governments to achieve. They have been endorsed by the national Aboriginal community controlled health organisations and state and territory governments. With the concerted effort being taken at the state and federal level, I am hopeful that we will soon see an improvement in Aboriginal health. The Northern Territory Country Liberal Party government is working closely with organisations such as Batchelor College's Health Unit, the Menzies School of Health Research and with their own Territory health services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a challenge for governments, supervising authorities and Aboriginal community leaders to achieve health improvements, policy improvements, by redressing the poor nutritional value of food sold in the community stores as a first instance, as well as lifting the standards of financial accountability and the performance of basic food providers, the community store.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are, of course, other challengers, particularly those at universities and the need for university research and health work, such as the excellent work being conducted at Flinders University in South Australia and the issues that are associated with that. I hope, in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7320"> the future, we will see more of that type of academic activity take place in northern Australia and particularly in the Northern Territory. We cannot allow the dramatic problems of the Maningridas, the Numbulwars and the Hodgson Downs to continue unabated. The costs to future Aboriginal generations are too high and must be fixed now.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7320"><TITLE>National Crime Authority</TITLE>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think&mdash;actually it would have been John Elliott, myself, Ken Biggins, and I think Peter Scanlon was there.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He was then asked: what happened after the decision?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I went&mdash;almost immediately I went overseas with John Elliott. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On page 567, he goes on to say that he was in Japan. He continues:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After you spoke to Scanlon, what did you do then?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Jarrett:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Elliott was there. I checked with John Elliott to make sure he was happy to do the transaction. It was less&mdash;it was 120 million pounds, not&mdash;was where&mdash;came to hedge up to 200&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Jarrett:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well the short term one matured in January.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Rozenes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And that resulted in a loss?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Jarrett:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The loss in that statement of $39 million.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well the initial&mdash;the initial transition was done by Peter Scanlon and then</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had a few phone conversations, I suppose just confirming what he had confirmed really.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On page 570, Rozenes says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If I can take you now to the second transaction, that is the transaction that resulted in Elders Finance incurring the loss of approximately $27 million on or about 7 September 1988.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Jarrett says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And he goes on to explain the background and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the place and I think John Elliott had been talking to Roger Douglas about New Zealand. I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7321"> think that he came back understanding that the New Zealand economy was ahead of Australia and turning around . . . but they believed because of the strength of the economy that the New Zealand dollar would appreciate over the following twelve months . . . So Ken Biggins and myself argued to John Elliott that we should close the contract out.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Once it was established that they were losing money on this transaction. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . but in any case the contracts were closed out and&mdash;result in that second payment of 27 million&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">to Hawkins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Later in the evidence&mdash;on page 580&mdash;the discussion returns to the first transaction where Jarrett again confirms that Scanlon, Elliott and Biggins were all involved in the discussions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to move on to Ken Biggins's evidence which he also gave on 19 December 1990 under oath to the NCA. He was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can you tell us what it is that you know about the first transaction?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And he replied (page 613):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Answer: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That Ken Jarrett had spoken to me and said he had already spoken to you about this particular hedging contract or contracts and that you had advised him that the corporate area would acknowledge to the BNZ the existence of the contract, and that I was seeking his approval to do so.

<PARA STYLE="Para">That is John Elliott. John Elliott said, `Fine.' The answer continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, he had been through it with Mr Jarrett and he was happy it could be acknowledged.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And it goes on and on. All of the principals that were charged were involved in setting up this deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would briefly like to return to some evidence I gave previously to the Senate which was Mr Elliott's own testimony,  where he implicates himself as having been involved in this transaction. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And so, I agreed with him that he ought to take the 120 million pound cover but that it ought to be done through a bank.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On page 665 of Mr Elliott's transcript, Mr Rozenes said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, the next time I really remember having any dealings about that transaction was in January when I&mdash;I suppose I hit the roof about it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And he hit the roof because they had lost all that money. But again, Elliott admits he knew all about it. He was privy to the conversation to set the deal up. He gave authority to set the deal up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we go to Mr Scanlon. Mr Scanlon is the man who actually set the deal up, and he admits it as shown in his transcript from 19 December:</PARA>

He wanted, finally, to tell the truth and he gave evidence to the NCA about the true nature of these transactions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Paragraph 12 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In about June 1984 EXL, through a subsidiary Elders N.V., made an issue in Europe of convertible bonds having a face value of U.S.$160 million. The motivation for the issue was partly a need for EXL to raise capital and partly to enable executives of the company to take up financial interests in the company in a manner which could be self&hyphen;funded. I believe the scheme to finance executive participation was proposed initially by Bankers Trust. It was attractive to the intended beneficiaries in that it was expected that the bonds would increase in value as EXL prospered and it would enable them to maintain some control over the company.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Paragraph 13 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I became involved in discussions relating to the proposal initially with WIESENER and ELLIOTT. By the time that issue was made ELLIOTT, SCANLON, WIESENER, Cowper and Lord were, to my knowledge, aware of the executive participation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was the so&hyphen;called Swiss bonds issue for which John Elliott put his hand on his heart and said, `I know nothing about it.' Ken Jarrett was the man who organised it for him. He was his right&hyphen;hand man inside Fosters, and he has gone on oath and said, `I organised it. John Elliott was in it.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Paragraph 16 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 10 and 11 April 1986 EXL through a subsidiary, purchased approximately 18.56% of the issued share capital of BHP. On the same dates BHP purchased the U.S.$105 million parcel of Elders N.V. convertible bonds at a price which represented a profit to the beneficial owners of the bonds 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7323"> totalling tens of millions of dollars. By my own calculations the total profit amounted to about A$78 million.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is $78 million profit on bonds that they owned, not, as they try to pretend now, that they knew nothing about. Ken Jarrett was a beneficiary of the bonds. He put up his hand and said, `I am in part ownership of these bonds with Elliott, Scanlon and others.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Paragraph 21 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During that same period I was generally aware that between 21 and 26 May 1986 a company associated with . . . HAWKINS . . . and . . . PRATT . . . (which I now know to be Beid Pty. Ltd.) purchased approximately 4.4% of the issued share capital in BHP. As a result, the NCSC declared to be unacceptable the share acquisitions and the conduct of HAWKINS and PRATT in relation thereto.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Paragraph 27 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the first half of 1987 SCANLON came to see me and said that EXL owed HAWKINS money as part of an arrangement with HAWKINS in relation to the BHP shares. I took this to be a reference to the BHP shares purchased by Beid Pty. Ltd. in May 1986. SCANLON told me that it was necessary to pay it in a way that was not disclosed. I think he mentioned a figure in the order of $30 million. Certainly, whatever amount was mentioned at that stage was a lot less than was ultimately paid. The purpose of this approach to me was to ask me how the payment could be made covertly.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Paragraph 29 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had a number of further conversations during 1987 with SCANLON on the question of how the payment to HAWKINS could be disguised. At one stage he asked me whether company to company hedges might be used as the method of concealing the payment.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened on Friday in the Victorian Supreme Court of Appeal is very important to this case. The decision is conclusive that the basis for the acquittal of Elliott, Scanlon, Biggins and others was fundamentally flawed. Mr Justice Brooking said on page 12 of his judgment that in deciding whether the NCA had exceeded its reference, Mr Justice Vincent needed only to have looked at the wording of the reference itself, and no&hyphen;one disputes that the reference itself was sufficient to deal with the H fee transaction.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Justice Brooking concluded on page 22 of his judgment that the course of action taken by Mr Justice Vincent in looking behind the wording of the reference to the events that preceded it and taking into account what was in the mind of the officers of the NCA when they approached the minister for a reference in the Elliott case was completely inappropriate on the part of Mr Justice Vincent. Mr Justice Brooking was supported in his view by Mr Justice Winneke and Mr Justice Tadgell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The course of action taken by Mr Justice Vincent has no precedence to support it and has produced the wrong outcome. As a consequence of reaching the totally incorrect conclusion that the reference was inadequate, Mr Justice Vincent compounded his mistake by then ruling all the NCA evidence, which I have just been reading from, inadmissible. This was incorrect. Mr Justice Vincent then proceeded to declare that, because the evidence was inadmissible, there was no case to answer and therefore the accused should be acquitted. This was also incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Justice Brooking has also made it clear that it is not appropriate in this case for the judge to determine the outcome of a trial before a matter has been put to the jury. The Brooking decision establishes that the basis of the Elliott acquittal was fundamentally flawed and that there was absolutely no basis for Mr Justice Vincent to acquit Elliott, Scanlon and Biggins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the acquittal in 1996, many derogatory statements have been made in the media by Elliott and Scanlon about the competence of the NCA to prepare a case, lay charges and present the case to court. John Elliott, Peter Scanlon, Ken Biggins and Ken Jarrett lied under oath in their evidence before the NCA. Elliott and Scanlon lied in their evidence before the NCSC. Elliott and Scanlon lied in their evidence before the joint committee overseeing the National Crime Authority. Elliott and Scanlon lied at their press conference after the 1996 Vincent decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Elliott and Scanlon have always lied in regard to their knowledge of the beneficial owners of the Elders convertible bonds. Elliott 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7324"> and Scanlon have always lied in relation to VicInvest. Elliott and Scanlon have yet to utter one word of truth on any of these transactions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators would be aware that yesterday the government introduced a package of proposed legislation to deal with unfair treatment of small business. What I wish to address today is a case study of how badly small business can be dealt with by big companies in this country&mdash;a case study which demands the urgent attention of every person in this Senate so that they can understand how the large oil companies have manipulated the system, abused the law and abused so&hyphen;called voluntary codes of practice to their own advantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a sorry case which saw a small family company driven into the ground at the manipulation of one of our large oil companies, in this case Mobil. Mobil is a supplier of fuel products to Cairns international airport on behalf of all of the fuel companies in Australia. It has an arrangement whereby they all use one company to deliver products in their own name to the airport. Mobil in turn used a distributor at Cairns airport which was a company called Air Vision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Air Vision was basically owned by the Boundy family, and they had had this business for many years. They were a long&hyphen;term distributor at that airport. They have always, in so far as I understand the situation, acted in a thorough and acceptable manner. In fact, so acceptable has been the service of Air Vision that a couple of years ago Mobil suggested to the principals of Air Vision that they increase their working capital by borrowing money from the banks, seeking advances from banks, for the purposes of Air Vision taking over the distribution of fuel products not just in Cairns, where they already were, but at Kingsford Smith Airport in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be imagined how attractive a proposition this was for Air Vision. Accordingly, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> following the suggestion made to them by Mobil, they did go to the bank, they did increase their working capital, they purchased a property in Sydney from which their executives could work and they made other investments in terms of computer technologies and so on, in the belief that they were going to continue operations in Cairns and, further, that they were going to take over the distribution of fuel products at Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened, however, was that there was a change of heart in Mobil. Mobil decided that not only were they not going to allow Air Vision to become the distributor at Sydney international airport, but, moreover, that they were going to do this job themselves in Cairns. Therefore, Mobil decided to terminate its agreement with Air Vision for the distribution of fuel products at Cairns airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point, obviously, this company no longer had any business at all and, through APADA&mdash;the Australian Petroleum Agents and Distributors Association&mdash;they sought to have the matter dealt with under Oilcode. That is what they did. Unfortunately, Mobil did not want to play by the rules. Not only did Mobil not want to play by the rules; they also decided that they did not want to pay the outstanding invoices that were due to Air Vision&mdash;invoices in the amount of $300,000. The matter went to a conciliator, Mr David Newton. As a result, an offer was made by Mobil. But it was a `take it or leave it' offer in the amount of $450,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Air Vision and the Boundys claimed a substantially higher amount. The turnover at that airport would justify a substantially higher amount; their previous profit figures would justify a substantially higher amount; and fairness, given that this company has been there for decades, would require a substantially higher amount. Mobil said, `$450,000&mdash;take it or leave it.' At that point, Air Vision said, `Hold on. There is further information which has not been considered by the conciliator,' and they put further information, further evidence, before the conciliator. At that point, Mobil refused to cooperate with the conciliator and withdrew this case from Oilcode.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7325">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So concerned was the conciliator that he has written a letter to Mobil Oil Australia Ltd. I shall read the letter to the Senate. It is addressed to Mr Symington and Mr Stevens, and it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Garth and Craig,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Re Mobil and Air Vision&mdash;Cairns Airport&mdash;Conciliation under Oilcode Principles</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to Craig's letter of 10 September 1997 terminating the conciliation of the above matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I share the disappointment that a resolution of this matter has not occurred through conciliation. It is the first conciliation in 7 years out of approximately 35 cases under the Oilcode procedures that has not resulted in agreement between the parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is especially disappointing that Mobil has terminated this conciliation and by doing so failed to comply with my directions to provide further information so that I can form a view as to a fair and reasonable outcome of this dispute in accord with Oilcode principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If that information had been provided then depending on the content of that information I might have formed the view that a higher payment than my suspended recommendation and Mobil's offer of $450,000 may have been a fair and reasonable settlement. Mobil's termination could reasonably be seen as an attempt to prevent such a possibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am also very concerned about the fact that Mobil has not as far as I am aware adequately responded to Air Vision in respect of unpaid invoice claims of approximately $300,000 which in my view is an additional item to matters covered by the $450,000 as I stated in my suspended recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view Mobil has not complied with clauses 4 and 5 of the Conciliator Appointment Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am very concerned to protect and advance the integrity of the Oilcode process and my comments are directed to that end.</PARA>

I would hope that if Mobil are sensible, if they do not want their dirty linen aired, as it ought to be, they will at least start to become reasonable and start to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the Oilcode principles before further action has to be taken in this place.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the senator for her question. Yes, I am aware of the Prime Minister's remarks, and I agree with them. The remarks made at the CEDA conference, as I think you well know, have been taken out of context, misunderstood and misreported. For confirmation of that, I think you can lead to this point&mdash;that it was not me that asked that the matters raised at the CEDA dinner be Chatham&hyphen;house rules. That, I understand, is CEDA's practice. They invite someone to dinner and they say, `We have Chatham&hyphen;house rules dinners.' In fact, they contacted my office and asked if we had an objection to a journalist being there. I said I had no objection whatsoever to a journalist being there. It is between CEDA and the journalist whether the journalist has broken the requirement that CEDA places on them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming to the specific matters, I am very pleased that I have a complete tape of the relevant speech. If, Senator, you are interested in employment strategies, can I refer you to the OECD job strategy. Can I ask you to go through the 10 or so issues listed by the OECD as being appropriate for maximising employment opportunities and employment growth. They are things like getting appropriate macroeconomic settings right, having an efficient education and training system, maximising the generation of new technology and the dissemination of it and having a freer industrial relations system. One of them relates quite specifically to the question of unfair dismissals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am surprised you asked this question because it leads me to the opportunity of reminding you of one of the impediments to increasing employment in Australia that was there&mdash;your old unfair dismissal law. You do not seem to understand the consequences of your very unfair unfair dismissal law.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MACKAY" NAMEID="9L6">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, you asked me the question, so I am entitled to answer it&mdash;and I am answering it. You know, or you should know, that small business, when it believes that it is going to be very expensive to change a person who has proved unsatisfactory for one reason or another and to select 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> another person, does not take a new person on if there is a high cost to that&mdash;and there was a significantly high cost under Labor's unfair unfair dismissal law. What you do in that situation is simply employ casuals because you will not take the chance that you might make a bad choice. If you cannot swap someone over and take a new person on who you hope more appropriately fits the requirements of your small business and if it is going to cost you too much money, you will not do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When there is a very unfair unfair dismissal law, such as the one you supported, people feel particularly secure in their jobs, whether they are performing properly or not. A job becomes almost a tenure. And the point that  is being made with respect to this particular OECD aspect of the job strategy is that you cannot have a tight industrial relations system with a very tight unfair dismissal law which will inhibit business from changing people over. That is, if you are good at the job, you get to keep it and you are secure in your job; if you are not good at your job, then you should be insecure in it. That was the point that was made in the CEDA speech.</PARA></ANSWER>

I can confirm for you the various levels of unemployment; I do not have the long&hyphen;term unemployed figures with me. You ask: does that in itself merit a big tick? You are obviously in the habit of misunderstanding what has been said. I was asked a question quite specifically at the National Press Club last week or the week before and I clearly indicated that the government is not satisfied with the level of employment and unemployment, and the government is very concerned and determined to ensure that the level of unemployment comes down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I did say is that the electorate, which is completely understandably impatient and fed up with long&hyphen;term unemployment, is looking for change, is looking for improve ment and will be looking very seriously at what any government did and, in our case, has done to remedy the problem that we faced coming into government. They will give us, in my view, a big tick for the enormous effort we have put into repairing the mess that you left behind. Just in case you have forgotten the mess that you left behind&mdash;we had 13 years of your government, Senator; you were not here for all of them&mdash;you had an average unemployment rate of about 8.5 for 13 years. And after 18 months you think you have some credibility, a shred of it, left to come in here and ask this government what it is doing about unemployment when you created the problem. You had 11.2 per cent as an unemployment rate, which was the highest since the Depression. That is what you achieved. Do you think that gives you any credibility whatsoever to come in here and ask us about what we are doing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just explain to you a number of the things we have done. We have put the budget back into the black. If you do not understand the value of that, I do not think that in the few minutes available to me I can possibly give you enough lessons to clue you in. But you must understand the benefit that is to the economy and the opportunity it creates in terms of the lower interest rates that come for the business sector to in fact bloom and generate more real jobs. You must understand that.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have put an enormous effort into freeing up the industrial relations system. You probably do not agree with what we have done. I am sure you don't, because you liked a nice, tight system that kept you with 8.5 per cent unemployment for 13 years, and you were happy with that. We are not happy with that, and that is why we changed the industrial relations system. We have made a number of significant changes in relation to small business. Small business is where the jobs are in fact going to come from. We made a number of significant changes in that respect.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the usual practice, privilege matters relating to joint committees are raised in the house which administers the joint committee. The joint committee on native title is administered by the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the principle that the Senate's power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions, and should not be used in respect of matters which appear to be of a trivial nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the existence of any remedy other than that power for any act which may be held to be a contempt.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is not my role at this stage to make any judgment as to the facts of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since these provisions were adopted, Presidents have followed the principle that a matter should be given precedence if it is capable of being held by the Senate to satisfy criterion (a) and if there is no other readily available remedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several cases alleging improper interference with witnesses have been given precedence by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Presidents and  referred to the Privileges Committee and reported on by that committee. In some cases, as a result of recommendations by the committee, persons have been found guilty of contempts of the Senate because of interference with witnesses. No penalties have been imposed because the persons have usually withdrawn offending actions against witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The past rulings of Presidents and reports of the Privileges Committee have made it clear that allegations that witnesses have been interfered with have always been regarded as meeting the criteria the President is required to consider and have always been taken extremely seriously by the Privileges Committee. In the present case, there are several elements which should be noted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, this is a case of a person who has been invited to give evidence before a committee but has not yet given evidence. The Privilege Resolutions of the Senate and the reports of the Privileges Committee make it clear that improper interference with a witness can occur before the witness has given evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the point has been made in public controversy about this matter that the Attorney&hyphen;General has a statutory power to direct the Australian Law Reform Commission as to the work it is to undertake. Improper interference with a witness, however, can be constituted by an act which a person is otherwise lawfully entitled to take. This has been made clear by the courts in relation to contempt of  court and also by the Privileges Committee in relation to interference with Senate witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the point has also been made in public controversy that the Australian Law Reform Commission does not have a statutory function to give evidence to parliamentary committees. The question of whether a witness has been interfered with, however, does not depend on the nature of any evidence to be given or on the power or ability of a witness to give it. This principle also applies equally to legal proceedings and parliamentary proceedings.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7342">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the public controversy indicates, there is some dispute about the facts of this matter. Standing order 81 does not require any assessment of the facts. It is for the Senate to determine whether the matter should be referred to the Privileges Committee. If it is referred, it is then the task of the Privileges Committee to inquire into and to find the facts of the case. The President determines the question of precedence on the matter as submitted by the senator raising the matter.</PARA>

Senator Sherry, for the last 20 months of the Keating government, was exceeded only by Kim Beazley and Senator Bolkus in claiming travel allowance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am endeavouring to make it crystal clear that this is working the system. This is a sharp practice. It is possible to bring yourself within the guidelines by finding an excuse to be in Hobart on every conceivable occasion, making every effort to be there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to you that the principle that Senator Ray espoused the other day was in fact to look at a pattern&mdash;and here you have a very significant and consistent pattern of staying in Hobart on a regular basis&mdash;and then ask, `What is going on here?' The principle underlying this is that the taxpayers ought to provide compensation for those who would normally incur expenses in staying in capital cities, which can be very expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what you would do is declare that you stayed in Hobart if you stayed in Hobart. If 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you stayed in Opossum Bay, 50 kilometres away, in a sleepy rural hollow up a dusty track, you would say: `I stayed at Opossum Bay but I argue that somehow I am entitled to a capital city claim.' It undermines the whole principle of the travel allowance arrangements if you are entitled on a very regular basis to not pay any money out of your own pocket but pick up $300 a night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I invite Senator Sherry to indicate on how many occasions he actually did stay with his mother or at his mother's place in that 143 nights and whether he paid out any money on those occasions. I ask him to justify why he happened to be in Hobart on so many occasions. We know that he is right at the top of the tree. We know that as shadow minister for finance there are not too many interest groups that he needs to be seeing on a regular basis. But if he managed to find enough in Hobart on 37 occasions, let us hear about it. Let us not simply say that DAS guidelines have a broad definition. That is not what Senator Kemp said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, the proper course of action to take if you want to act openly is to specify Opossum Bay and then argue your case. Say that it comes within a broad definition, point to a guideline if you can and then justify your claim. To simply put down Hobart when you stayed 50 kilometres away, I submit, is very misleading indeed. The taxpayers will be the judge of this. All I can do is invite Senator Sherry to come up with a lot more information than he has provided to date. It is clear that Senator Sherry has managed to find excuses to be in Hobart on as many occasions as possible and at the same time has managed to find opportunities to earn $300 a night. We have no idea on how  many occasions he actually had to expend any money out of his own pocket. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

The amazing thing was that, even though he was briefed, the Acting Minister for Administrative Services went into the other place today and said: `There is no definition of "capital city".' How could he be advised of that? I know Administrative Services currently is in a total shambles, but how could he have said that when, firstly, 3&half; years ago Senator Sherry's office checked with Administrative Services for guidance and was given it on this very subject? Secondly, the DAS guidelines say the following:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Capital city is as defined (in relation to its boundaries) by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is a guideline. It does apply. It is there in the DAS guidelines. How could Mr Ruddock and, presumably, Senator Kemp be ignorant of that fact? The ABS definition of Hobart is that it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . comprises the local government areas of Hobart, Glenorchy, Clarence and Brighton and the predominantly urban parts of Kingsborough, New Norfolk and Sorrell.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It defines it. So we have a definition in the DAS guidelines of a capital city and the ABS definition of the capital city includes Opossum Bay and many other areas. So, in effect, are we to go back through the records and find that certain members have stayed in Dandenong in Melbourne and therefore have misclaimed because it is not regarded as part of a capital city? Ask anyone in Dandenong, anyone in Parramatta, anyone in Port Melbourne, `What capital city do you live in?'  and they will say, `Melbourne', `Sydney', `Hobart'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this pre-prepared attack, which has been launched both here and in the House of Representatives, is based on a lack of substantial work, bordering on the misleading of both chambers today. I do not believe they deliberately misled. I just think it was out of total ignorance. Senator Alston comes in and says, `I think Senator Sherry's travel allowance is a bit high.' What does Senator Alston say when the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) in the first nine months of government claims 80 per cent of the avail

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join this debate&mdash;an extraordinary one, the first time ever we have had a government minister move that the Senate take note of another government minister's answer. We must admit that the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, made an absolute fool of himself in question time. This is an orchestrated attack from the Liberal Party, and Senator Kemp could not even organise a supplementary question. Senator Kemp, really, it is not surprising that your deputy leader, the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston), trying to get a little bit of a confidence builder after his bad day on Tuesday of last week, was trying to show you how it is done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motivation for this incredibly weak parliamentary performance from Senator Alston and Senator Kemp is this: Mr Sharp and Mr McGauran have resigned as ministers of the Howard government&mdash;for rorting. They resigned because they put in false travel claims. Their travel allowance claims were false, and they were found out. They were 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7346"> found out, even though the former Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Jull, who also has had to resign&mdash;that is three ministers last week&mdash;tried to cover it up. That is the truth of the matter. They were found out. They were found out rorting, and the responsible minister for administration of parliamentary entitlements was found out covering it up. What does that say about the Howard government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since that time, of course, we have had the grand strategy hatched by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, in the House of Representatives, and these pathetic underlings over here, Senators Kemp and Alston, to try to square it up.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what they are saying: that you can only have a valid capital city claim if you stay in the central business district.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you know what brought all this up? Mr Simon Crean, the member for Hotham, when he was challenged about why Senator Sherry's travel allowance was so high, said, `Senator Sherry does not have a home.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But why didn't Senator Sherry seek to correct the record as soon as Mr Crean stated that mistruth? Because he thought it would go to the keeper and nobody would realise. But Mr Costello picked up the line and absolutely pilloried Senator Sherry. As a result Senator Sherry puts out a media release not condemning Mr Crean&mdash;his friend and colleague&mdash;but condemning Mr Costello.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public of Australia have the right to ask this simple question: why is it that Simon Crean, a senior man in the Australian Labor Party, was under the impression that Senator Sherry did not have a home when in fact he owns two homes? Why did Mr Crean labour under that misapprehension? I will give you a bit of a guess why: because Senator Sherry's travel allowance was well&hyphen;known around this place. It was a matter of constant debate, constant discussion and some awe&hyphen;inspiring concern at the magnitude of it.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I spend the majority of my time in Burnie and I travel as required.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Coming from the shadow minister for finance, the shadow spokesman on superannuation, when we go through the figures, what do we find? We find that for 60  per cent of his time he is claiming travelling allowance. So, at the best possible analysis, he spends only 40 per cent of his time in Burnie. A minority of the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No wonder the Labor Party left this country with a $10.3 billion deficit. You think that 40 per cent of the time is somehow a majority. It clearly is not. You ought to apologise to the Senate and acknowledge that you misled the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time is short, but Simon Crean ought to come clean. Why was he under the misapprehension that Senator Sherry did not have a house? Because Senator Sherry never goes to live in the house; he is busily claiming his travel allowance, going around the country or staying at mum's at Opossum Bay, which is 50 kilometres, in rough terms, away from Hobart&mdash;a quarter of the way to Launceston.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7349">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The humble petition of the undersigned Citizens of Australia respectfully sheweth:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) That members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 have been deliberately and wrongly excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable overseas `active service' under `Operational Service' at Section 6.(1)(c)(ii) of the Act. They are the only Australian Citizens to be treated in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) A defined group of citizens, who served in the Malaya area, being members of the Royal Australian Navy Defence Forces so affected, have been wrongly excluded, whereas members of the Army and Air Force were not so excluded, and this is supported by documents in the Australian Archives and elsewhere on public record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Allied veterans of 50 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Korean War can have had qualifying eligibility for benefits under the Act. Veterans of South Vietnam, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and the United States can have eligibility resulting from the Vietnam War. Their service was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Members of the RAN were designated as `on active service' when they served in a designated zone that is within a 12 NM limit offshore from the coastline of Malaya from 9th May 1952 to 1st December 1960. These dates are verified in Declarations by the Governor&hyphen;General, Commander&hyphen;in&hyphen;Chief of the Naval and Military Forces of the Commonwealth, contained in Commonwealth Government Gazettes No. 40, 5th June, 1952 and No. 82, 8th December, 1960.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Members of the RAN were engaged on operational duties that applied to all service personnel everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, including the death by `friendly fire' of a sailor during support operations. This can be attested to be a Naval Flag Officer who witnessed the death on board his ship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) The Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this authorisation was contained in Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) They were not bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements which were introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962, which act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) the Australian citizens serving in the Royal Australian Navy complied with all the requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g) The Department of Veterans' Affairs has indicated it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In Parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not be found. This action would not have been taken had the Parliament been properly informed. Parliament has unfortunately approved the introduction of qualified retrospectivity through accepting these amendments to the Act resulting in an injustice being perpetrated against ex&hyphen;service personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore humbly pray</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your Honourable House take appropriate action to remove the previous Government's discriminatory exclusion of Naval personnel in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of Australian citizens' honourable service with the Royal Australian Navy for their country, whilst on `active service' in the Malaya campaign.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME><FROM>(from 20 citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Airports Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1997 No 104, which provide a formula for the Minister to give an airport operator notice to adjust its foreign ownership to comply with the 49% maximum foreign ownership requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes that r.3.01 provides that, where the Minister is of the opinion that an unacceptable foreign&hyphen;ownership situation may exist, the Minister must give a company notice before applying to the Court. In effect such notice gives the Company an opportunity to answer the Minister's concerns. Regulation 3.02 sets out the matters to be included in the notice. However, r.3.02 provides only that the Minister may include certain specified matters. The Committee would appreciate your advice on why it is not a mandatory requirement to include these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph 3.01(2)(b) requires the company to provide evidence to the Minister's reasonable satisfaction that an unacceptable foreign&hyphen;ownership situation does not exist. As this discretion may 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7353"> have significant commercial implications, the Committee would appreciate your advice on whether merits review of the exercise of this discretion is available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subregulation 3.02(1) provides, quite reasonably, that nothing in r.3.01 affects an airport&hyphen;operator company's obligation under s.42(1) of the Act which requires an operator to take all reasonable steps to ensure that an unacceptable foreign&hyphen;ownership situation does not exist. The Committee notes, however, that r.3.02(2) provides for prosecution of an operator company whether or not the Minister has given notice under r.3.01 and even if the time allowed in the notice has not expired. The Explanatory Statement advises that the reason for the introduction of the giving of notice provision recognises the difficulties faced by listed companies in complying with strict limits. However, having provided for safeguards under r.3.01, it appears that r.3.02(2) takes away much of the protection of those safeguards. The Committee would appreciate your advice on why r.3.02(2) was considered necessary.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator O'Chee</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 27 August 1997 in which you sought my advice in relation to a number of concerns the Committee had with the Airports Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1997 No.104 (the Regulations).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before addressing the Committee's specific concerns I thought it might be useful to set out briefly the context of the Regulations and what they are intended to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Airports Act 1996</EMPHASIS>  (the Act) imposes limitations on, amongst other things, the ownership of leased airports by foreign persons. The ownership provisions of the Act are set out in Part 3 of the Act and the Schedule to the Act. Part 3 limits foreign ownership of an airport-operator company to 49%. There are two offences associated with this rule. Firstly, section 41 prohibits the acquisition of shares which would result in a breach of the 49% rule. Secondly, section 42 obliges an airport-operator company to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the 49% limit is not exceeded. Any breach of these rules can be enforced by a prosecution and/or an application to the Federal Court for remedial orders. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition of the difficulties faced by listed companies in complying with strict limits the Regulations sought to provide a mechanism under which the Minister may give an airport-operator company a period of grace of up to 180 days to adjust its foreign ownership level where necessary to ensure compliance with the 49% limit. While there is nothing in the Act that would prevent the Minister from staying his or her hand for any period administratively, potential bidders asked, and Cabinet agreed, for this to be reflected explicitly in Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations were drafted in a form which was consistent with the scheme of the Act. A regulation which would have required (rather than merely empowered) the Minister to delay taking any enforcement action (either by way of prosecution or remedial order) for 180 days would fetter the discretion conferred on the Minister by the Act and thus be invalid. On the other hand, there is no legal objection to requiring the Minister to give notice of his or her intention to apply for a remedial order provided that he or she is not then required to wait 180 days to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While regulation 3.01(1) is intended to require the Minister to give the notice, regulation 3.01(2) makes it clear that the notice may (but need not) include a statement that the Minister Will allow 180 days for the airport operator company to provide evidence that an unacceptable foreign ownership situation does not exist before making the application. Similarly, regulation 3.02(2) is intended to make it clear that the regulation does not fetter the Minister's discretion to bring prosecutions in appropriate cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also expressed concern that the Regulations do not provide a right of review on the merits of a decision of the Minister as to whether he or she is satisfied as to the evidence provided by an airport operator company as to compliance with the foreign ownership limits. I assume that the Committee's concern is that the Minister may then proceed to seek remedial orders without the opportunity for the company to apply for a review on the merits of the evidence which was the basis for the decision to apply to the Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsection 242 provides that a decision of the Minister to apply, or to refuse to apply, to the Federal Court for an order or injunction is not reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Provision for merits review of the Minister's decision under the regulations would be inconsistent with the unavailability of merits review of a decision to apply for Federal Court orders under the Act. Ultimately, the Act establishes the Federal Court as the authority on whether there has been a breach of the foreign ownership limit. In this context, a right of review of the Minister's decision under the Regulations would have no practical 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7354"> effect and would create the possibility of conflict with the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the regulations merely provide a formal basis for the Minister to provide reassurance to companies which may exceed the foreign ownership limit despite having made all reasonable efforts to comply. This is in recognition of the practical difficulties for listed companies of ensuring compliance at all times. They do not, indeed cannot, purport to limit the discretion of the Minister to either bring a prosecution or seek remedial orders under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope that the Committee finds this response to its concerns helpful.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opment concerning the amendments of the Civil Aviation Regulations (Regulations) made by Statutory Rules 1997 No 111.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first matter of concern to the Committee relates to the fact that the new regulation 42ZZ of the Regulations allows the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) to give a direction in relation to maintenance control manuals but does not specify that the direction must be in writing. The requirement for a direction to be in writing is dealt with in subregulation 5(1 ) of the Regulations which provides, among other things, that where CASA can give direction under the Regulations, CASA can give the direction in Civil Aviation Orders or otherwise in writing. I have been advised that any directions issued by CASA in relation to maintenance control manuals would be in writing in accordance with subregulation 5(1). Any such directions would also need to be in writing for evidentiary purposes. To confirm these arrangements I will arrange for an amendment to the Regulation to require such directions to be in writing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second matter relates to the inclusion in the amendments of strict liability offences in relation to the amendment of maintenance control manuals and the inspection of those manuals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maintenance control manual is a fundamental link in the control of the maintenance of class A aircraft (which, in the main, comprise the larger aircraft used in regular public transport operations involving the carriage of fare paying passengers). The need for CASA to exercise greater control, both, over the appointment of maintenance controllers, and over maintenance control manuals, has been highlighted by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation on several occasions and was also referred to in the report of the Coronial Inquiry into the Monarch crash at Young. In these circumstances, I believe that it is necessary and appropriate that strict liability offences attached to these provisions given the drastic consequences that can result from inadequate or improper maintenance of such aircraft.</PARA>

You noted that question 1.2 of the form requires the provision of the name, address and date of birth of the applicant, all partners, all directors, office holders and shareholders who will participate in the management of the depot. You sought my advice as to why the collection of these personal details is necessary as the collection of unnecessary personal information by a government agency may be a breach of privacy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Customs Depot Licensing scheme set out in Part IVA of the Act was inserted on 1 April 1997 as part of the new cost recovery scheme for import related services. The new licensing regime applies to premises previously appointed under paragraph 17(b) of the Act as places for the examination of goods on landing. Goods which were being allowed onto these premises were subject to Customs control, however the appointment of these places had no formal application or licensing process. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New section 77G of the Act provides for the granting of a Depot Licence, upon application in accordance with section 77H, to use the place described in the licence for the following purposes:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the examination of goods that subject to the control of Customs by officers of Customs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 77H of the Act requires an application for a depot licence to be in an approved form and to contain such information as the form requires. The questions on the form have been designed to enable to Chief Executive Officer of Customs (the CEO) to have sufficient information available to determine whether the application meets the requirements for the grant of a depot licence under section 77K of the Act. In particular, paragraphs 77K(l)(a), (b), (c) and (d) require the CEO to be satisfied that all persons who would participate in the management or control of the depot (including the applicant, all partners (if the applicant is a partnership), all directors, office holders and shareholders (if the applicant is a company), are fit and proper persons to so participate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In deciding whether a person is a fit and proper person for the purposes of paragraphs 77K(1)(a), (b), (c) and (d), under subsection 77K(2) the CEO must have regard to, amongst other things, any convictions of the person for offences committed against the Customs Act and any convictions for offences against other Commonwealth, State or Territory laws punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year. To determine whether any such convictions have occurred in the preceding 10 years in accordance with these provisions, Customs uses the information provided in response to question 1.2 on the application form for the purpose of obtaining a police records check. The information and the results of the check are used for the purposes of determining whether the nominated persons are fit and proper persons for the purposes of section 77K of the Act, and does not amount to a breach of privacy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In closing, I would note that before receiving your letter a review of the form by the Australian Customs Service had already identified this question as one which, without further clarification, might raise concerns as to the use of the information provided. Action is being taken to revoke the approval of the current form and to replace it with a new approved form The new form will include a note at the end of question 1.2 putting applicants on notice that nominated persons will be the subject of a police records check and that the information will be used in part to satisfy the requirement that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7356"> the nominees are fit and proper persons for the purposes of section 77K of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Customs Service has also put in place strict procedural guidelines to ensure that the privacy of partners, directors, employees etc. is not breached should such a police records check result in the CEO not being satisfied that the person is a fit and proper person for the purposes of section 77K of the Act, and that opinion results in a refusal to grant a licence. Information about an individual, or identifying an individual, will not be made available to the applicant for the licence without the consent of the individual concerned.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator O'Chee 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter dated 27 August 1997, requesting advice as to whether regulation 58 and subregulation 59.2 of the Migration Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules No. 109 involved subdelegation of legislative power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have received advice from the Attorney-General's Department ("the advice) to the effect that neither regulation 58 nor subregulation 59.2 infringe the rule against subdelegation of legislative power for two reasons, as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, the regulation and subregulation at issue are expressly authorised by subsection 504(2) of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Migration Act </EMPHASIS> 1958 ("the Act"). Subsection 504(2) of the Act provides that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Section 49A of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Acts Interpretation Act 1901 </EMPHASIS> does not prevent, and has not prevented, regulations whose operation depends on a country or other matter being specified or certified by fee Minister in a notice published in the Gazette after the taking effect of the regulations."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The explanatory memorandum to subsection 504(2) (originally inserted into the Act as subsection 181(1A) by Act No. 196 of 1991), explains that the provision was intended to permit "the Regulations [to] prescribe matters to be specified by the Minister by notice published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette".</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advice provides that the overall structure of subsection 504(2) contemplates the inclusion of provisions, such the ones at issue, in the Migration Regulations. That is, the structure of the subsection is consistent with the explanation provided in the explanatory memorandum. Similar provisions have been repeatedly included in the Migration Regulations since 1991 on the basis of subsection 504(2).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, as mentioned in the advice, the making of a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette </EMPHASIS> notice under the new provisions should properly be viewed as an exercise of administrative power, rather than an exercise of legislative power. This is because there is an established distinction, enunciated by the Courts, between a legislative instrument and an administrative instrument. Legislation determines the substantive content of the law, such as defining general rules of conduct or entitlements, while administrative action applies the law, whether in a particular case or more generally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus, instruments that take the form of notices prescribing categories of persons (regulation 59.2) or a qualifying points score (regulation 58) in a way contemplated by the law itself are examples of administrative action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for drawing this matter to my attention.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 seeks to amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to give effect to decisions in respect of X and R&hyphen;rated programs on narrowcasting services, which were included in a range of measures announced by the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts and the Attorney&hyphen;General on 8 April 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, X and R&hyphen;rated programming is banned on subscription broadcasting services and on free&hyphen;to&hyphen;air broadcasting services. However, narrowcasting services, that is, services limited in availability or appeal, are not prevented from providing X and R&hyphen;rated programming.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increasingly, pay television companies are offering extra channels of specialised programming through narrowcasting services. Such services provide pay television companies with an avenue to broadcast explicitly sexual material which mainstream television services are prohibited from showing. In response to considerable community concern, the Government has decided to amend the Broadcasting Services Act to prohibit programs that have been refused classification or have been classified as X on subscription television narrowcasting services and also on open (free&hyphen;to&hyphen;air) narrowcasting services. This will serve to prohibit the depiction of actual sexual acts (as provided for under the current X classification) across all television services, whether broadcast or narrowcast. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has also decided to apply to open narrowcasting services the same restrictions regarding R&hyphen;rated programs as currently apply to commercial television broadcasting services. These include the requirement that codes of practice must provide for modification of R&hyphen;rated films to comply with the previous AO classification, and restrict the hours within which M and MA material may be broadcast.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Typically, open narrowcasters are community television services provided free&hyphen;to&hyphen;air, and without any limitation on access by children. It is considered, therefore, that they should be subject to the same restrictions as apply to other free&hyphen;to&hyphen;air services in respect of the televising of R-rated material.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not proposed to prohibit R&hyphen;rated material on subscription television narrowcasting services. The Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association's code of practice for subscription television narrowcasters, which has been registered with the Australian Broadcasting Authority, requires that the broadcast of R classified material on subscription narrowcasting television services will be restricted to access by those with appropriate disabling devices, and services devoted predominantly to adult erotica will be restricted to late night access only.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This inquiry was established following public expressions of concern by recipients of human pituitary hormone at the fairness and adequacy of the legal settlement being offered by the Commonwealth to the hormone recipients treated under the Australian human pituitary program. This program ran from 1965 to 1985 for the treatment of infertility and short stature. It was suspended in 1985 following deaths overseas from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which had been linked to pituitary hormone treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia, the deaths of five hormone recipients from CJD had occurred by 1992. Legal action for compensation for `nervous shock' on learning of the possibility of contracting CJD as a result of treatment was commenced in 1993 by a number of recipients in both Melbourne and Sydney. The settlement offer was made by the Commonwealth prior to any case going to court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee received a large volume of evidence&mdash;nearly 140 submissions, both public and confidential, mostly from people who were hormone recipients. The views and concerns expressed to the committee were quite varied.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7363">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee sat for over 25 hours to hear evidence from in excess of over 60 witnesses. Much of the evidence was conflicting and contradictory. Much of it was of a scientific or technical nature and hence open to different forms of analysis, differing conclusions and, indeed, varying interpretations. Some witnesses saw the committee as a forum to seek expiation of feelings of guilt. Other saw it as a vehicle to demand legal redress in either civil or criminal courts. A few sought compensation; many sought an acknowledgment of pain and suffering from the Commonwealth. A number of witnesses broke down in front of the committee. All committee members were greatly affected by the great suffering endured by recipients and family members. What commenced as a passage of hope for many infertile persons ended as a disaster for some.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be noted that this was an all&hyphen;party committee. It comprised three government senators, three opposition senators, an Australian Democrats senator and Senator Harradine from Tasmania. There were no party divisions or differences pursued by individual members of the committee. Accordingly, the unanimous nature of the report and the unanimous set of recommendations are proof of the desire of the committee that the government give effect to all recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some recommendations go to matters of process, keeping of records and dispersal of information in both a timely and sensitive manner. Other recommendations require significant government departments to review their methods of operation and not be purely reactive. Other recommendations have modest budgetary implications for government. One of the two key recommendations is that all of the new evidence brought before the committee be rigorously reviewed by Professor Allars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was asked to consider a number of specific issues in its terms of reference. Firstly, it was asked to consider the adequacy of the response to the report by Professor Allars. Following increasing public awareness and media interest arising from CJD deaths of hormone recipients, an inquiry was established in 1993, headed by Professor 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Margaret Allars. Professor Allars reported in June 1994, making a number of recommendations relating to issues including: the allocation of funds for CJD research; the activities of the CJD task force; the establishment of an advisory committee; fostering support groups; enhanced counselling services; review of NHMRC guidelines on human experimentation; transplantation of organs and tissues from cadavers; guidelines for the provision of information to patients by medical practitioners; and amendment of the National Health Act to ensure information can be released directly to members of the public and that special arrangements applying to the distribution of pharmaceutical benefits are appropriate. The committee concluded that, generally, the recommendations have been adequately implemented, although there were some areas where the committee has recommended that additional action be taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the committee was asked to consider claims that the government refused to make certain documents related to the inquiry available to recipients. The committee was advised that discovery processes relating to the Allars and other documents were agreed between the Commonwealth and the legal firms representing the litigating recipients. The committee received considerable evidence on allegedly missing or destroyed documents. The committee was satisfied that none of the Allars documents had been lost or destroyed. However, a range of possibly relevant departmental and CSL files have been destroyed, apparently in accordance with standard Australian Archives procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the committee was asked to consider the Commonwealth's offer of settlement. The Commonwealth offered to litigants and then to all recipients on 4 April 1997 to pay compensation in the event that a recipient actually contracted CJD. The Commonwealth also undertook to pay legal costs of the litigants and that benefits under the pituitary hormone trust account would not be affected. The Commonwealth did not agree to pay damages in relation to nervous shock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Major concerns expressed to the committee related to the failure of the settlement offer to recognise psychiatric injury and the deadlines 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7364"> within which the offer had to be accepted. A related issue was an alleged threat by the Commonwealth to enforce costs against the plaintiffs. The committee was informed that the initial deadline was 24 April 1997. This was subsequently extended to 30 June and then, in accordance with a request by the Senate, until the government's response to the committee's inquiry was known. While most recipients regarded the time frame as insufficient, the committee was advised that the usual acceptance period in Supreme Court matters was seven to 14 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was concerned that some recipients felt pressured to settle by reason of the deadline. Of greater concern was the financial situation of many plaintiffs&mdash;that without legal aid they could not pursue their case. The committee accepted that people who suffered psychiatric injury should be compensated. This is a key recommendation that may be found as recommendation 6. The committee has recommended that without conceding the likelihood or otherwise of a legal action on psychiatric stress succeeding, the Commonwealth should also offer payment, through the allocation of additional funds to the trust account, to recipients who have evidence that they have suffered psychiatric injury as a result of treatment under the AHPHP. The Commonwealth should consider extending this offer of payment to include recipients who have suffered psychological stress or significant life disturbance. The committee has also recommended that unapproved recipients who are formally identified and accepted as such should be eligible for the settlement arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee further recommends that a formal acknowledgment should be made by the Commonwealth of: the deficiencies in the operation and oversight of the hormone program; the experimental nature of aspects of the treatment under the program; and the anxiety and stress that has been caused to hormone recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, the committee looked into whether legal aid was unfairly denied. Eligibility for legal aid is a complex question. Applications need to be made in accordance with guidelines operating for particular schemes. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> application for legal aid was originally made in May 1995 and was considered for eligibility under three non-statutory schemes. The application was eventually rejected for funding in August 1996. The committee received detailed evidence on the consideration under each scheme and the review of decisions which applied to this particular application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was advised that in early 1996 the Attorney-General's Department was of the view that it was an appropriate case to receive legal aid funding under the cases of national importance scheme. However, the proposed costs of the case would have used about half the total money available under that scheme. The department intended to seek ministerial and cabinet approval for additional funding when the election intervened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the election, guidelines for eligibility to receive legal aid changed and the application was no longer eligible for the particular scheme. The committee has noted that, as governments change, legal aid guidelines change and eligibility criteria change. There is a limitation to the funds available for legal aid, and apparently meritorious cases are not always able to be funded. The committee has no doubt that the denial of legal aid placed pressure on many plaintiffs and their legal advisers and influenced their decision to accept the settlement offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifthly, the committee also considered whether public safety in relation to the pituitary hormone program had been adequately protected. In this regard, the committee relied heavily on the report of Professor Allars. This report contains adverse findings and many instances of deficiencies and illegalities associated with the establishment of the scheme, the collection of glands and preparation of hormones, the role of government agencies, and the decisions and actions of the department following the suspension of the hormone program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence received by the committee tended to confirm the various findings made by Professor Allars. Not only were these findings not disputed by the committee, but the evidence also provided information which may not have been available to the Allars 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7365"> inquiry and could lead to an expansion of some of the Allars findings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of this evidence involved scientific argument and focused on quite specific aspects of the hormone program. Particular issues raised in this evidence and referred to in the committee's report included the collection of pituitary glands, deficiencies in the development of and compliance with exclusion criteria, the processing of pituitaries&mdash;concerns with screening of glands&mdash;quality assurance and contamination, potency testing and compliance with good manufacturing practice, developing knowledge and awareness of the transmissibility of CJD, and supervision of the product and the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was unable to make an authoritative judgement on the merits of the scientific and technical information provided in evidence to the committee. It considered that some of this information raised serious concerns and warranted a further review. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> The committee therefore recommended that, in view of the availability of further information&mdash;much of which is conflicting in its nature&mdash;which may not have been considered by the Allars inquiry, Professor Allars be invited to review, with the necessary independent scientific advice, this further information on scientific matters concerning the AHPHP, which has become available since the Allars inquiry reported and, if Professor Allars is unavailable, that another suitably qualified independent person be invited to undertake the review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also considered action taken by government agencies following the cessation of the program in 1985. Evidence was received which raised concerns over the approach adopted in relation to a number of actions, including the tracing of both approved and unapproved hormone recipients, the provision of information about CJD and other issues to recipients, and the release of identifiable information to blood banks and organ and tissue agencies. The committee made a number of recommendations to address these concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee received the sad and disturbing evidence late in the inquiry of a probable sixth case of CJD. The department's actions 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in relation to this probable new case appeared slow and reactive and lacking in compassion and sympathy at a time of considerable stress for the recipient and her family. The committee has recommended that the department put in place protocols to ensure sympathetic early intervention so that information and assistance is provided as soon as a recipient is suspected to have contracted CJD.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I should acknowledge the excellent work carried out in a very short time frame by the staff of the Community Affairs References Committee. They had to collate a large number of bulky and often highly technical submissions, arrange for a large number of witnesses to be heard in a relatively short space of time and carry out a large degree of liaison work with a range of departments. The quality of the committee's report is in no small measure due to the high degree of professionalism they brought to its preparation. In the final analysis, however, it is a report of this Senate and I wish to thank them for their hard work. I commend the report and its recommendations to the government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My comments on this CJD report of the Community Affairs References Committee will be brief in view of its comprehensive nature. In speaking on behalf of government senators, I think it is significant to note the extent of the concern by the government members of the committee for those affected by the sadness of the CJD issues. Those who have suffered and died from this terrible disease have our deepest sympathy, as do their families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We commend the recommendations of the committee to the Senate. I am sure that everyone associated with the inquiry would agree that the committee has inquired into the terms of reference thoroughly, as has been demonstrated by Senator Bishop's comments just concluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank Senator Bishop, as chairman of the committee, for his particularly constructive approach and ensuring that we achieved a unanimous report. It was a difficult issue. The work that Senator Bishop put into ensuring the unanimous report is something of which he should be very proud.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7366">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to thank the secretary of the committee, Mr Elton Humphrey, and his staff for the excellent work they did in providing the support that is so crucial to a committee such as this. The issues were particularly emotive and complex. The work that the committee secretariat put into ensuring that the facts were presented to the senators cannot be underestimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to recognise the work of Senator Lightfoot. He is not speaking on this report at this stage, because he is waiting in the wings, so to speak, to make his first speech in this chamber. Ironically enough, that speech is going to follow the discussion on this report today. He may choose to speak on this issue at a later date. He contributed, in my unavoidable absence during the recess when I was on electorate duties, to ensuring that the government was represented well on the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government senators are particularly supportive of the recommendation to ask Professor Allars to do further work. We believe that it is essential that hormone recipients and their families, who have been subject to considerable uncertainty in the past, do not face any more uncertainty. Therefore, I am sure the government will move as quickly as possible to request Professor Allars to undertake the work recommended by the committee. In the event that Professor Allars is not available to do so, I am sure that the government will appoint a similarly appropriately qualified and objective person to undertake this work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From discussions that I have had with the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, in the consideration prior to this committee really getting under way, the government is particularly keen to respond to any committee recommendations at an early date. The government members of the committee very much empathise with the concerns and extreme sadness of recipients and their families. I am sure the government in its response will reflect its real understanding that issues connected to CJD are about people and their families at a very profound level. I certainly commend the report to the Senate as a very constructive document.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank the committee staff for their dedication, for the enormous volume of work they got through in a very short period of time, and for the excellence of this final report. I also commend the chair for the work that was done in making sure this was a majority report with no dissent and, indeed, for getting a set of recommendations that everyone could agree to. In particular, I thank Senator Harradine for his meticulous research and questioning, and Senator Lightfoot, the government senator who worked with us most of the time but who, unfortunately, cannot come into the chamber to comment on this report today as he has not yet made his first speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think I am right in saying that this was a difficult and, at times, emotive issue for members of the committee. But we have to acknowledge that it is a devastating problem for the people caught up in this situation. Hopefully, this committee's unanimous report will be another step along the road to justice for them and that it will ensure those people are supported, and not just financially. I will draw attention to a recommendation that relates to this area. It goes beyond just financial support; it goes to recognition of the experimental nature of these programs, recognition of the difficulties they and their families now face, particularly in light of the sixth case. We must now think of all those people who can go back through the batch numbers and, perhaps, link their own treatment to the same batch as the sixth victim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key recommendations does involve money, and I hope that the government does not step back from it. Indeed, I would not just recommend to the Senate that this report be accepted. I would also recommend to the government that the recommendations be followed. Recommendation No. 6 says that an additional allocation of funds to the trust account has to be made, and that the purpose should be widened to include those people who are able to show that they do have psychiatric injury, psychological stress or significant life disturbance as a result of being part of this program. We are talking 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7367"> about men and women, most of whom have families who are also very much affected by this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer to some of the issues that are very much in the minds of some of those who are still involved with litigation. In particular, I call on the government to make it far easier for these people to access the documents they need. This has been covered in the recommendations quite clearly, but we should not have these barriers put in place for people who are trying to get justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not just talking about official recipients. One of the points made, as we listened to the witnesses, was that there are a number of unofficial recipients; that some doctors kept spare material on one side and treated a number of other patients experimentally. Tracing them, as well as tracing the rest of the recipients, is something that, hopefully, the department will facilitate very speedily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The deficiencies of the program must be acknowledged. I think that many of those who came before us found it very difficult to appear before the committee and, in front of others, go through the trauma they and their families have been through. We have to now look at an acknowledgment of the various deficiencies within the programs, going back to issues such as the collection of the glands and the fact that some, it seems, were collected illegally. The report, at page 125, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although exclusion criteria were established, the Allars Inquiry found that there was a failure to communicate the criteria to the pathologists and mortuary attendants who removed the glands.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Stage by stage, as we worked through the processes followed to get this program up and running, we found that there were breaks in communications and that information which was available was not flowing through to many of the people making the decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did use the Allars documents quite a bit. We noted that that inquiry looked at the warnings that were not heeded from people like Dr Whitten of the National Biological Standards Laboratory. He noted in 1966 that, because large particles, including viruses, would precede the hormone through the column&mdash;this is the extraction process for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hormonal material that they were after&mdash;the line would become contaminated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite a lot of technical evidence before the committee, I still had great difficulty accepting that all of these warnings were out there but that somehow the message did not get through. Certainly, patients were never informed of the likelihood of any problems of any sort of contamination of the material that they were receiving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We looked at some of the history of the knowledge of CJD. It was a disease that was first identified and described in 1920. In 1968, the transmissibility of the disease in monkeys was understood. In 1974, the first transmission in people, through a corneal transplant, was acknowledged. And, again in 1974, there were warnings beginning to appear in international medical literature. But, somehow, those involved in the programs here at all the various stages&mdash;whether it was those actually running the program, those overseeing the program or those in the departments&mdash;did not heed the messages. We never really established whether people were not reading these international reports and, therefore, were not reading about the difficulties, but the message certainly was not getting through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1977 a Nobel Prize winning paper contained warnings about CJD. That is where the British have drawn the line as far as compensation is concerned. They have basically said that, as it was understood in 1977, people certainly should have made themselves aware of the most up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date research regarding this issue, and compensation is payable after that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not go into many of the details in terms of the rest of the recommendations. I will just say, in closing, that I hope this report goes some way to offering some comfort and additional support to all those people who were so active in requesting that this be looked at by the Senate. I hope that it will also be of some comfort to those who have been so upset by the way in which the settlement was made and who were feeling that they were forced to sign on the dotted line&mdash;it seems that even the threat of losing their homes was understood to be hanging over the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7368"> heads of many&mdash;and accept the government's offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's offer really added up to nothing more than waiting until people were confirmed to have CJD&mdash;mostly that is post&hyphen;mortem&mdash;and then compensation would be payable. I think we had an admission that it was really not much more than was available already.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the government accepts these unanimous recommendations and that they do not sit on a shelf somewhere for month after month waiting for something to be done. Despite the fact that there are recommendations here that do involve money, and despite the fact that some members of the committee felt that there could have been some stronger recommendations, I stress that they are unanimous and I hope that this government will act upon them as soon as is possible.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity of expressing appreciation to Senator Lees, the last speaker, and to the members of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee&mdash;particularly to the chair and to the secretariat. A mighty job has been done. I also express my gratitude to the committee and to the Senate in enabling me to become a participating member of the committee for the duration of this inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, of course, welcomed the establishment of the inquiry into aspects of CJD, the government's response to the Allars report, the treatment of recipients of human pituitary hormones and whether certain government bodies failed to protect public safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendations that are contained in this document&mdash;and I seriously recommend that honourable senators get the document and study it&mdash;resulting from the inquiry are modest, moderate and manageable. I do hope that those to whom the recommendations are directed understand that. I believe that the recommendations could have been far more stringent but it must be indicated to the chamber that these are unanimous recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of the human pituitary hormone program is a history of broken rules. It is another example of the deadly results of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> technological imperative driving so much medical research and the application of medical research. The driving force in many of these areas is the technological imperative that what can be done should be done and it is done, very often, with insufficient attention to proper procedure, health risks and informed consent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Dr David Howes, the former chief virologist and head of the biologicals branch of the National Biological Standards Laboratory, the NBSL, told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the consumers who will pay the heaviest price . . . when the duty of care plays second fiddle to other imperatives . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These are very important matters indeed. Our examination of the whole CJD episode provided a window into lax processes and cover&hyphen;ups by those responsible for regulating human experimentation and by those whose grave duty it is to ensure the highest standards in the regulation and manufacture of biological products derived from blood, tissue and organs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women seeking help for infertility, and men and women of short stature were essentially guineapigs in an unlawful experiment which has so far killed four women and one man. Another woman is believed to be dying from the disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every day, recipients must live with the possibility that they could be living incubators of the human equivalent of mad cow disease. I urge my Senate colleagues to read their distressing testimonies to try to comprehend the depth of their suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, very little can be done other than what is recommended in the committee report and people need to go through the traumatic but, nevertheless, healing experience of acceptance. They need to be encouraged to do this and they need to be given all the support that they require. Some of our recommendations go to that very point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report actually documents the mistreatment of these people&mdash;the recipients&mdash;at the hands of those whose responsibility it was to ensure the highest standards were applied to experimentation on human subjects in Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7369">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">CSL did not meet the requirements of the Australian regulatory authorities in the manufacture and distribution of the hormones. It failed to follow world's best practice in pooling and homogenising of glands. It failed to comply with the codes of good manufacturing practice. It told pathologists to ignore the exclusion criteria about possible hepatitis&hyphen;infected glands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In evidence to the committee, Dr Wes Whitten, reproductive physiologist and former assistant director of the National Biological Standards Laboratory, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was a shocking product. I cannot believe that this could have been marketed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Dr Frank Peters, formerly assistant and acting director of the NBSL, told the committee that it was his opinion that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">not one batch of fertility hormone met all the regulatory standards and many did not even meet CSL's own rudimentary standards.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The lack of informed consent recurs time and again in the thousands of pages of submissions and transcripts. Recipients believed that the hormones were safe. They did not know that the HPG had not been evaluated for clinical use before the program started. They did not know they were receiving processed material from dead bodies, some of which was 99 per cent impure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Possibly the most damning indictment of the procedures for collecting the glands was the statement by Dr P. Schiff, CSL's representative on the Human Pituitary Hormone Advisory Committee, HPHAC. He was responsible to the then minster for health in overseeing the program. He advised the gland collectors that, `Unless the body is badly decomposed it is never too late to take the gland.' In other words, decomposing body parts could be removed and processed for use in living humans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Conflicts of interest were rife. Those with a vested interest in the program were also those supposed to be regulating the hormones. There was enough information in 1966 to indicate that the program should not have been allowed to proceed. But it did, and was only shut down in May 1995. All overseas cases involving hormone recipients have been settled in favour of the recipients. France, in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fact, has gaoled two doctors for manslaughter and a pathologist in charge of the program for poisoning. But in Australia no-one has been prosecuted. No-one has admitted fault. In the words of one hormone recipient: `It is not the money that matters; it is the fact that people should be accountable for what they did to us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It could be argued that all of this is with hindsight. But there are certain universal ethical principles which should be maintained and should have been maintained then. One of them is: first do no harm. The second is: do not allow the science technologists to be the ones who influence the setting of ethical standards. You will note that we on the committee have recommended to the NHMRC that the revision of the statement on human experimentation should be expedited. That will be done by the Australian Health Ethics Committee. One of our worries is that the current IECs are in-house committees and, therefore, are not totally separate from influence by science technologists and those with a vested interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the secretariat and the committee members for their extremely hard work. I hope the recommendations will go some way to providing justice and hope to the victims of the CJD legacy and contribute to higher, tighter standards in human experimentation and the protection of public safety. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statements read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first report which I have tabled concerns the proposed development of operational facilities at RAAF Base Learmonth. The base is located on North West Cape, Western Australia, 1,235 kilometres north of Perth and the base covers an area of approximately 2550 hectares, situated on the coastal plain between Cape Range and Exmouth Gulf. The nearest township, Exmouth, is 35 kilometres north of the base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">RAAF Base Learmonth is a bare base which forms part of a chain of defensive airfields across northern Australia and is vital to the air defence of north&hyphen;western Australia. The primary function of the base is to serve as a deployment base for combat aircraft in a contingency. The base was developed during the early 1970s and 1980s and no further development or major maintenance work has occurred since.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal examined by the committee involved the construction of: explosive ordnance loading aprons for fighter, strike and maritime patrol aircraft&mdash;one apron will double as an explosive ordnance apron for transport aircraft;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">alert facilities for fighter aircraft; operational and technical support facilities; ordnance preparation facilities; a central emergency power station; rehabilitation of existing airfield pavements; airfield lighting equipment; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">airfield lighting, engineering services and civil works.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated out&hyphen;turn cost of the proposed work was $69 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee has recommended that the work should proceed. After inspecting the base and conducting a public hearing at Exmouth, at which senior RAAF officers gave evidence, the committee concluded that<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> </EMPHASIS> there is a need for operational facilities at RAAF Base Learmonth to be upgraded to bring them into line with requirements designed to enhance its capabilities for the deployment of fighter, strike and maritime aircraft in a safe and flexible manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal attracted interest from local government authorities, who raised a number of issues relating to the use of the main runway for regular public transport aircraft as well as the siting of a number of facilities within the civil aviation area. The downgrading of the runway's pavement classification number by Defence was a matter of concern and the committee has recommended that Defence should enter into further discussions with the Shire of Exmouth about the practicalities of upgrading the pavement classification number of the runway. The project was the subject of environmental impact assessment and the report mentions 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a number of safeguards and precautions to be adopted during and after construction of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second report which I have tabled covers the proposed redevelopment of facilities for the 51st Battalion Far North Queensland Regiment throughout Far North Queensland and the Torres Strait. By way of background, I should mention that this Army unit, with its headquarters in Cairns, is a General Reserve Regional Force Surveillance Unit. The role of the unit is to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance operations in Cape York Peninsula, the Gulf country and Torres Strait. Elements of the unit are widely dispersed over more than 20 locations throughout its area of operations, which covers 640,000 square kilometres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">During any move towards conflict, FNQR would be a vital element of the first three layers of land defence. The unit's observation posts or reconnaissance patrols would be a vital source of initial strategic information which would provide early warning of any changing situation. Once other military forces are in place, the unit would operate in a zone well forward of any protected vital asset in Far North Queensland to provide a surveillance screen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before addressing the specifics of the proposed work, the committee sought to establish if the unit has an assured future, following the restructuring of the Army. The committee was advised that this unit, the Pilbarra Regiment and NORFORCE&mdash;all regional force surveillance units&mdash;have an assured future. The committee also sought to establish if the recruitment of reservists can be sustained. Again, Defence advised that a fundamental principle of recruitment is to recruit people from local communities who have specific knowledge and understanding of their areas and use this to support the surveillance capability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The history of the unit has been characterised by strong representation of members of local communities. At present, 40 per cent (200 members) of the unit are indigenous. It was also pointed out that the unit is currently manned to its full establishment. This is a good indication of the effectiveness of recruitment campaigns and a strong indicator of the support for the unit in Far North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal involves the provision of facilities which will enhance the unit's ability to meet its operational commitments and will involve the redevelopment of some existing facilities and the provision of new facilities. This work will address current deficiencies such as non&hyphen;functionality, size, non&hyphen;compliance with building and occupational health and safety standards and location. The proposal involves work at 22 locations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee concluded that, based on the evidence the general lack of modern storage facilities and poor working conditions at headquarters, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7371"> company headquarters and patrol locations are having an adverse impact on the ability of the unit to undertake assigned tasks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed work encompasses: construction of a new facility on the Queerah Meatworks site in Cairns for the Regimental Headquarters, Administration Company, Alpha Company and 134 Regional Cadet Unit; new company facilities at Weipa;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">new platoon facilities at Atherton and Normanton; upgrading of existing platoon facilities at Innisfail and Bamaga; upgrading of the camp on Horn Island; upgrading of existing facilities at Normanby Street and the construction of new facilities at the naval fuel installation site on Thursday Island; and provision of secure storage for vehicles, boats and associated equipment at 14 patrol locations at Cooktown, Coen, Kowanyama, Aurukun, Pormpuraaw, Lockhart River, Cloncurry, Burketown, Mornington Island, Badu Island, Boigu Island, Yam Island, Darnley Island and York Island. The estimated out&hyphen;turn cost of the proposed work is $22.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee has recommended that the work should proceed. The committee sought to establish if there will be opportunities for the local construction industry to be involved in the project. The committee was advised that elements of the project will be packaged to maximise opportunities for involvement by locally based companies. Normal tendering processes will be followed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I begin my speech this afternoon I would like to again acknowledge the contribution of the late Senator John Panizza, whose position I was fortunate enough, under unfortunate circumstances, to take. I offer again to his wife Coral, his children and his family my condolences. I knew John very well. John was a man of the bush, something with which I associate myself. His life's interests, apart from his family and his church, were farming and mining, two pursuits I am vitally concerned with. I have given an undertaking that not only will I look after the people of Western Australia, but I will particularly concentrate 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on those people in the bush whom John served so well. I trust that I will be able to fill, in some way at least, the boots that he so untimely left behind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to declare that I am a republican&mdash;if a republic can place more bread on the national table for those in need, if a republic can reduce national debt, if a republic can resolve the problems between black and white Australians, if a republic can bring with it honesty and integrity through all levels of government, if a republic will bind the commonwealth of states together in a mutual bond of trust and fairness, if a republic will deliver lower unemployment, particularly to our youth, and if a republic will cause Western Australia to obtain a more equitable retention of the wealth it creates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the mooted republic, however, is to split us along sectarian or ethnic lines or rend the fabric bandage that has bound us together for nearly 100 years&mdash;one of the very few nations on earth to have maintained a democracy for so long&mdash;then that will only reinforce my conviction that the system of government we have is by its history enviable. Then I will remain under these circumstances a staunch advocate of the monarchical system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not always a supporter of the royal family, but of the system of government I am, lest it be perceived as ambiguous, an unabashed admirer of Her Majesty the Queen Elizabeth II, one of the greatest women, I believe, of the 20th century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Political change has too often in history ended in tragedies&mdash;such as those which are being enacted in several discrete parts of the globe currently&mdash;and brought with it bloodshed, hatred and division. I have no doubt that the republican&hyphen;monarchical debate will, by its very nomenclature, degenerate into sectarian lines at least in part. Whether the issue attracts spontaneous advocates to its ranks who believe that one or the other of the systems will be better for Australia remains to be seen. Perhaps as never before in our history, except in times of war, will our youth, with their pristine minds and honest, uncluttered motives, play such a determining role in our future.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7372">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no minimalist change. It is not a matter of crossing out `Queen' and inserting `President'. It is not as simplistic as erasing `King', as when George VI died in 1952, and inserting in its place `Queen'. It is a fundamental alteration of our very constitutional foundation. It will cause, before we are through with it, much heartache and vitriolic dissent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What part, we have to ask, will parliament play? What say will the people of Australia have? What role will the High Court adopt? Will the High Court, for instance, find that having a monarchical state is inconsistent with a republican federation? What will be the excuse if the longitudinal and latitudinal lines that separate the states are erased?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However much admired the promoters of change are, I would ask my fellow Australians to look for the motive behind their advocacy. Words can often blanket meaning and true reasons for the support of change. Change without benefit is nebulous. I wish Australians clear and honest thinking in this, the most important constitutional issue to face us since federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, I now turn to the High Court. The perceived aptitude that the High Court has of recent times to transgress upon the hallowed green and red carpets of the legislature deserves some comment. Since its inception in 1903, two years after federation, the court, until the early 80s in the case of the Commonwealth, and the mid 80s in respect of the states, had always had the collective and paternal eye of the London Privy Council to temper any constitutional excesses. The Privy Council, in effect, was the last appellate court for the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the statutory cessation of appeals to the Privy Council, the High Court became the last court of appeal for the Australian nation. The High Court did, however, acknowledge that, whilst a residual path for the states to take constitutional issues to the Privy Council still existed&mdash;and still, in fact, exists&mdash;the High Court was not going to give its imprimatur to allow any such appeals. That begs the question as to why no reform of the High Court was undertaken when inordinate power&mdash;some would say, excessive power&mdash;was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> transferred to the High Court by itself, in effect, in the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do we reform the highest court in the land? There are no practical limits to the legislature; it is ultimately all powerful, and should be so. Where constitutional limits as checks and balances do not evolve with the nation's aspirations, then referenda can be resorted to. Governments must not lose their nerve to the judiciary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept unequivocally the concept of prior settlement of Australia by Aborigines&mdash;first, by the Oceanic negretos or the Tasmanoids, remnants of whom are still in Victoria, some of the Bass Strait islands and Tasmania; second, by the wave of Murrayians, who crossed the Plains of Carpentaria many ice ages ago; and the last and most significant Aboriginal invasion by the Carpentarians, probably no longer than 14,000 years ago or even less. But one would have to ask: would the High Court decisions on Mabo and Wik have been upheld by the Privy Council in its entirety, if appeals were allowed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My visit and subsequent correspondence to that august body in London strongly suggests no! That is not to say that I do not accept the prior settlements or even a form of ownership. What I do not accept is that the High Court is omnipotent, infallible, or has the unique god&hyphen;given ability to speak `ex&hyphen;cathedra' on all issues; or that its charter, significant of which was its role, as outlined by the founding fathers, to protect the states. It has, in too many recent cases, failed to do so. It has become centralist, somewhat arrogant and insulated from the real Australian world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court is the most manifest of the nation's tripartite machinery of powers. But it is only a cog in that machine; it is not the engine. The people of Australia are the engine, Madam President, and parliament should mirror the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time that the High Court evolved to become our last court of appeal, reform was needed. Constitutional restructuring of the High Court, in my view, is overdue. While the old adage, `power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely', does not in its literal form apply to the High Court&mdash;and I hasten to say that&mdash;there is a danger that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7373"> integrally this essential institution may not march separate from but in step with the legislature and the executive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">High Court reform that reflects representation from the states and territories is needed to prevent the outlying states being overwhelmed by the Sydney&hyphen;Melbourne&hyphen;Canberra axis. Furthermore, the High Court should be reminded of its initial role as a constitutional court that dealt specifically with constitutional problems&mdash;rather than branching into the realms of the legislature, as it is wont to do&mdash;and further reminded of its role to protect the states from the creeping erosion of their rights and the negative effect of centralism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to states rights, since the formation of this indissoluble federation of states&mdash;long on gestation&mdash;in 1901, there have been arguments between the federal government and the states. Most have been well&hyphen;justified. Western Australia, which produces nearly 30 per cent of national export income and yet pays $1.5 billion more in taxes annually than it receives, has every reason to resent at times its treatment by the increasingly centralist governments of Canberra. If one were to take Mr Keating's last budget as an example, although Western Australia has 25 per cent of the national road network, is one&hyphen;third of the nation, contributes, as I have said, 30 per cent of national export income and has about 10 per cent of the population, it was, nonetheless, only allocated 8&half; per cent of national road funding by Mr Keating in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, over the last four years, in spite of the massive contribution the state makes to the nation's coffers&mdash;we have the biggest diamond mine in the world, the biggest alumina powder provider in the world and the biggest delineated reserves of iron ore, we boast the biggest port in terms of tonnage in the world, rank with the biggest in production of gold, nickel and rutile, we will probably be the biggest producer of wheat in the nation this year and we are the biggest producer of petroleum gas condensate in the nation&mdash;our Commonwealth grants, including tied grants, which are part of a system which could be described as fiscal slavery, have been slashed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by approximately $700 million in real terms, with more to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There would be no problems with our state's hospitals, roads or schools if our forward planning&mdash;predicated on our share of the federal cake being equitably distributed&mdash;was not reduced. It should never be forgotten that it was the states which created the federation. Yet the federal child is dictating to the parental states in an increasingly worrying manner, by controlling the purse strings which were in the possession of the six self&hyphen;governing states 96 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should also be remembered that the states in aggregate are infinitely stronger than the federal government, which produced as little as $30 per capita last fiscal year in the Australian Capital Territory. The fiscal erosion of the states&mdash;particularly Western Australia&mdash;must stop if the federal government is to survive as a contented institution into the third millennium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this point, the Constitutional Convention, in my opinion, should include discussions on federal&hyphen;state reformations; not whether the Northern Territory should necessarily become a fully&hyphen;fledged state&mdash;I do not think we can afford that&mdash;but a sincere effort to reform and to stop the erosion of the outlying states, which causes resentment and antipathy towards Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> When I think of Western Australia, I am reminded of Aeneas Gunn's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">We of the Never Never</EMPHASIS> and her immortal words, `the tyranny of distance'. Western Australia is the only mainland state not to have a direct flight to Canberra. Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and even Newcastle and Coolangatta do but neither Western Australia nor the cherub state of Tasmania do. Recently&mdash;today, in fact&mdash;the federal aviation authority announced that Malaysia and New Zealand would be granted direct flights to the national capital. While I welcome those initiatives, the insult to Western Australia must be abundantly clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are yet to have a representative in the federal cabinet. I trust that that anomaly will be rectified during what must be, at a guess, a cabinet reshuffle. While the Commonwealth has increased its spending by 21 per cent over 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7374"> the same decade, we suffer both the iniquitous tied grants that have increased from 46 per cent to 55 per cent in a decade and are the chains of a centralist slaver around our necks and a decrease of 8 per cent in funding to Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From Perth to Darwin an undefended coastline which includes in its perimeter Port Hedland&mdash;the biggest tonnage port in the world, as I have mentioned&mdash;and the North West Shelf, the nation's biggest producer of petroleum hydrocarbons, adjacent and contiguous to that coastline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike South Australia, which has never had a High Court judge, at least Western Australia does boast one and, at times, two. With the implementation of Mabo and Wik, we have massive problems&mdash;unique to Western Australia&mdash;which require special attention. We hope these will be addressed by the Wik 10&hyphen;point plan. We believe that plan goes a long way to resolving those problems, so inherent and manifest in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Western Australia does have, as I pointed out, unique problems; not ones associated with its own making but more with the increasing cost to it of federalism. During my time in the Senate, a position in which I am honoured to serve my state, I intend to do just that: serve my state to the best of my ability and, through it, the rest of the nation. I trust, at the end of my tenure, my home state of Western Australia is better served and stronger for me being here. I thank you Madam President for your indulgence and I thank you fellow senators.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Foreign Affairs and Trade Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 is an omnibus bill which amends five acts administered by this portfolio:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963 (International Organisations Act)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994 (Chemical Weapons Act) and the Nuclear Non&hyphen;Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 (Nuclear Safeguards Act); and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Consular Fees Act 1955 and the Passports Act 1938.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill addresses a diverse range of issues, mainly of a technical nature, including meeting formal legal obligations in respect of international organisations, strengthening international nuclear safeguards standards and false passport applications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">International Organisations Act</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bulk of the amendments included in this omnibus bill relate to the International Organisations Act. These amendments update a nearly 35 year old act. They are necessary to keep pace with the increasing number and diversity of international organisations now being established.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important amendment will allow for the simultaneous entry into force of both the treaty establishing an international organisation and the regulations relating to that organisation. Otherwise Australia could find itself in technical breach of treaty obligations if there were to be a delay in implementing associated regulations. This amendment will be particularly useful when the treaty is unlikely to enter into force until some years after agreement has been reached to establish the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another of the more important moves in this bill is to tighten the definition of an international organisation which can be eligible for privileges and immunities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia only grants privileges and immunities which are required under our international obligations and commitments. When negotiating privileges and immunities as part of international agreements, this Government takes the line that specific items should be included only where there is a demonstrated functional need. We have to be satisfied that the specific privilege or immunity is necessary for the effective operation of the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disarmament Issues&mdash;Chemical Weapons and Nuclear Safeguards Acts</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also amends an oversight in the drafting of the original Chemical Weapons Act. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7376">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is highly unlikely that an inspection team will ever have to come to Australia to investigate another country's allegation that Australia was in breach of the Convention. Nevertheless, should this occur, representatives of the country making such an allegation will now be extended standard diplomatic privileges and immunities, along with other members of the inspection team.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is committed to the international disarmament process and enjoys a well&hyphen;deserved reputation as a leading player internationally on arms control issues. That reputation has been enhanced by this Government's successful efforts last year to help bring to conclusion the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty&mdash;a goal sought after by the international community for over 20 years&mdash;as well as our work over the last year in leading the international drive to gather sufficient ratifications to bring the Chemical Weapons Convention into force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The appointment in May of Dr John Gee, an officer of the Department, as Deputy Director&hyphen;General of the newly established Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons reflects wide recognition among parties to the Convention of Dr Gee's professional background and experience. Moreover, this appointment reinforces Australia's prominent position in this sphere of disarmament activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, Australia's reputation is further bolstered by the appointment of Richard Butler to the Chair of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), the body charged with ensuring the discovery and destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government's commitment to the cause of disarmament is evident in Australia's substantial contribution to the international effort to address the problems caused by the misuse of anti&hyphen;personnel landmines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In April last year the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced Australia's support for a global ban on the production, stockpiling, use and transfer of these weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In international forums the Government has continued to add its weight to the growing international movement in favour of eliminating anti&hyphen;personnel landmines as a weapon of war.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After Australia co&hyphen;sponsored a pro&hyphen;ban resolution in the UN General Assembly in December last year, the Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed the Conference on Disarmament in January this year, calling for work to begin on such a treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, Australia has participated fully in the international meetings and negotiations held in 1997 under the auspices of the "Ottawa Process"&mdash;a Canadian&hyphen;sponsored initiative which has finalised, in an ad hoc forum of countries currently committed to a ban on anti&hyphen;personnel landmines, a ban treaty which will be opened for signature in Ottawa 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in December 1997. The question of Australia's signing the Ottawa Treaty will be considered by Cabinet in the coming weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia does not produce and will not export landmines. The existing stocks of landmines are used only for training and research purposes. This is important as it allows us to assist, through mine clearance programs, countries such as Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mindful of the terrible human suffering caused by landmines, this Government has significantly increased funding for international mine&hyphen;clearance and assistance to victims as well as working with other countries to improve de&hyphen;mining technology. The Government has committed over $18 million since May 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has also made major efforts to make headway in reducing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Government took the courageous step in September last year of salvaging the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty from the Conference on Disarmament and submitting it to the UN General Assembly where it was overwhelmingly endorsed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has also promoted the Report of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons. The Minister for Foreign Affairs presented the Report personally to the UN General Assembly in New York last September and also to the Conference on Disarmament this year, urging its careful consideration by all governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is notable that the Commission's recommendations relating to the removal and destruction of nuclear warheads from delivery vehicles, and transparency in accounting for the resultant fissile material, appear already to have been taken up. This was evident in the START III parameters agreed recently in Helsinki between Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, one of the major amendments in this bill is to the Nuclear Safeguards Act. This will implement the recently negotiated International Atomic Energy Agency&mdash;or IAEA&mdash;Protocol to strengthen safeguards. This Protocol was developed as a comprehensive global response to some limitations with the IAEA safeguards system which were identified following investigation of Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new international system will supplement and extend the IAEA's existing safeguards agreements to increase assurances that states subject to comprehensive safeguards have declared all safeguardable nuclear activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia signed the Protocol in Vienna on 23 September 1997 and was the first country to do so. The Protocol will enter into force for Australia when the Government notifies the IAEA that Australia's statutory and constitutional requirements for entry into force have been met. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7377">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Australia, Lucas Heights will be subjected to increased international inspection. In addition, uranium mines and the area at Maralinga, will possibly be subjected to international inspections. The Australian Safeguards Office has consulted with the mine operators and with the private company undertaking research and development at Lucas Heights. They have raised no objections to this stricter regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consular Fees Act 1955</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Consular Fees Act 1955 expand the categories of persons who can be authorised to perform consular acts and charge the prescribed fees to include locally engaged staff (LES) overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consular functions performed by Australian missions overseas include a wide range of legal processes for the proper authentication of documents, such as administering an oath, receiving a declaration or affirmation, witnessing a signature, signing and affixing seals, and making and certifying copies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Consular Fees Act 1955 provides for the charging of fees for consular acts performed by Australian diplomatic and consular officers and certain other officers of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">LES are employees, not officers, of the Commonwealth Departments or agencies for the purposes of relevant legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, there is no prohibition in international law or practice (in particular, the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations) on LES performing these functions as part of the staff of a mission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will allow a fee to be charged for these functions when performed by authorised employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment is expected to result in improved and more flexible delivery of consular functions overseas which should reduce the cost to the Government of providing these services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment is consistent with Recommendation 5 of the June 1997 Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee Report on Consular Services, Helping Australians Abroad: A Review of the Australian Government's Consular Services: "that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade examine options to enable locally engaged staff in Australian posts overseas to undertake notarial acts".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government plans to provide its formal response to the Senate Report in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, the Government gave a commitment at the last election to improving Australia's consular services in general. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has taken a personal interest in many consular cases. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the Government will continue the process of developing our capacity to respond to consular crises, epitomized in the establishment of the Consular Response Group which was set up just over a year ago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New technology is being applied to the consular area of DFAT and a new 24 hour, Canberra&hyphen;based duty officer consular service is currently being tested.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The system of honorary consuls will continue to be expanded and better training for our consular staff will be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The emphasis on improved information for the public has already produced a Consular Information Service in DFAT which will provide up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date information to travellers. Our flow of information to the public in other ways, including through a continuing stress on timely and informative consular travel advices will continue to improve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A critical element in this is ensuring that all assistance is given to families in Australia of consular clients, supporting them in what is often a time of anguish and anxiety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Passports Act</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last substantive amendment covered by this bill relates to the Passports Act 1938. This amendment tightens the provision relating to the offence of making false statements in relation to passport applications. It adds the concept of recklessness as a mental element in the offence of making a false statement in a passport application or in support of an application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issuing of Passports is of course an important service provided to the public by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1997</PARA>
<PARA> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Thin capitalisation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will improve the effectiveness of the thin capitalisation rules in order to ensure that an appropriate amount of profit is derived in Australia in respect of foreign controlled Australian enterprises. The thin capitalisation foreign debt to foreign equity gearing ratio will be reduced from 3:1 to 2:1 for taxpayers who are not financial institutions. The gearing ratio for financial institutions will remain unchanged at 6:1.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To complement the new gearing ratio, the definition of foreign debt for companies that are not financial institutions will be extended to borrowings from overseas lenders for which a guarantee has been provided by a foreign controller or their non&hyphen;resident associates. This extension of foreign debt will not apply where a resident company can establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7378"> Taxation that the loan could have been obtained without the guarantee or security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition of foreign equity for fixed trusts will be calculated on the basis of their foreign controllers' fixed interests in the capital and net income of the trust. Discretionary trusts will be denied an income tax deduction for interest paid to foreign controllers or their non&hyphen;resident associates. For partnerships the foreign equity will be based on the interest that the foreign partners have in the capital and income of the partnership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also contains measures to counter avoidance arrangements. Asset revaluations for partnerships and trusts will be limited to market value changes. The provisions dealing with back to back arrangements will be repealed as it is considered that the general anti&hyphen;avoidance provisions of the income tax law will be more effective in countering such arrangements. The definition of a foreign investor will now include foreign partners, beneficiaries and trustees of Australian partnerships and trusts, so that the foreign partners, beneficiaries and trustees will be subject to the thin capitalisation debt to equity ratio requirement, as well as the underlying Australian partnership or trust.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Finance shares</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend the income tax law to address tax avoidance arrangements involving Eligible Finance Shares and Widely Distributed Finance Shares.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill seeks to make three amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first amendment would ensure the effectiveness of subsection 50(2D) of the act which prevents land claims over stock routes and stock reserves. Madam President, the background to this matter is that the previous Government entered into a Memorandum of Agreement in 1989 with the Northern Territory concerning the granting of community living areas to Aboriginal people in pastoral districts in the Northern Territory. As part of the agreement, the Commonwealth undertook to proclaim a 1987 amendment to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 preventing the making of land claims over stock routes and reserves. This amendment was made because it was never intended that stock routes and reserves should be available for claim.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment was proclaimed in 1990, however, it appears that it may be technically deficient. The effect of the 1990 amendment as drafted is that while the claims can not be heard by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner, they remain registered. This means that there is some doubt about whether the Northern Territory Government can deal with the land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1995 the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory governments reached an arrangement that an effective amendment be made in exchange for the Northern Territory accepting Commonwealth proposals for amendments to the Northern Territory's Pastoral Land Act 1992. The aim of those amendments is to expedite the granting of community living areas to Aboriginal people, particularly those being dealt with by the Community Living Areas Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment, once agreed to by Parliament, will conclusively eliminate stock route and stock reserve claims by removing any doubt about the effectiveness of subsection 50(2D) of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second amendment would apply where under section 50(1)(a)(ii), the Aboriginal Land Commissioner reports that he/she is unable to make a finding that there are traditional Aboriginal owners of land under claim. While such a claim is unable to proceed further, it is not finally disposed of. Consequently, such claims remain registered and there is some doubt about whether the Northern Territory Government can deal with the land. The amendment would finally dispose of such claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third amendment would remove any doubt about the effect of the sunset clause, subsection 50(2A). The sunset clause prevents the Aboriginal Land Commissioner from hearing and reporting to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7380"> the Minister on claims lodged after 5 June 1997. However, it does not prevent claims being lodged and remaining registered. As is the case in relation to stock routes claims, there would be some doubt about whether the Northern Territory Government could deal with land under claim. The amendment would remove this doubt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments contained in this bill will commence on Proclamation, with a 12 month limit on the time within which the Proclamation is to be made. The intended proclamation period has been provided so that, in accordance with the 1995 agreement with the Northern Territory, the stock route amendment can commence at the same time as the Northern Territory's amendments to its Pastoral Land Act 1992.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to give effect to the government's commitment to cap aircraft movements at Kingsford Smith Airport, KSA, at 80 movements per hour through the implementation of a slot system. This commitment was first made in our election policy statement on aviation in the 1996 election campaign. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today I am pleased to be introducing the Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill which represents a legislated a cap on aircraft movements. Its introduction follows 18 months of effort necessary to ensure a cooperative scheme is ready to be formally implemented following the passage of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The timing for formally legislating a maximum aircraft movement cap at KSA is right, as the number of movements at KSA in the peak morning hours is rapidly approaching the 80 movement limit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unlike Mr Albanese's earlier Private Members Bill we have been concerned when we legislated to put the cap in place to also deliver an effective tool to administer it. We have achieved this with the development of a slot allocation system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The slots system which has been developed, in cooperation with industry, will ensure that we have a workable and effective means for administering the cap.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The slots system will not only manage the cap in a non&hyphen;discriminatory way, it will help alleviate delays through congestion at KSA. This will be beneficial for all users of the airport&mdash;the airlines, the airport owner and most importantly the travelling public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By limiting the number of scheduled movements in any five minute period, the slots system will force the airlines to move away from their practice of cluster scheduling&mdash;where a group of flights, potentially well beyond the airports capacity, are scheduled with the same arrival or departure time. The bill requires movements to be spread more evenly across the hour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have also incorporated a compliance regime into the slot system which, in tandem with the spreading of scheduling as cluster scheduling is dismantled, will also promote reduced delays at the airport. Under the compliance system airlines will be liable to fines and other penalties for poor on&hyphen;time performance. This is a crucial element of the slots system which will provide airlines with an additional incentive to perform on&hyphen;time. Because off&hyphen;slot movements may involve fines unless an acceptable reason exists, the system will also bring transparency and accountability to a process of explaining why delays occur into and out of KSA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We intend to trial the off&hyphen;slot provisions of the proposed slot management regime for six months. This will enable the scheme to bed down and for industry to adjust to the new arrangements before fines are imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another objective we have met in developing the slots system is to guarantee residents of regional New South Wales continued access to KSA. The system we are establishing will safeguard the current levels of access that regional NSW have to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7381"> KSA, reflecting the Commonwealth government's commitment to country residents. This will be achieved by setting aside dedicated regional slots based on existing service levels, which cannot be sold or swapped to interstate or international services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with a deregulated aviation industry the slots system also provides for any potential new entrants to have equal access with their established competitors to slots at Australia's primary domestic airport. This is the most progressive level of access for new entrants at any slot&hyphen;constrained airport in the world. And it is possible to do this principally because we are putting this cap in place now, before the limit is reached in any hour. However, should the bill be delayed, allocation under the present ad hoc, first&hyphen;come&hyphen;first served process will continue. On current trends, the 80 cap will soon be exceeded if not clearly established through the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are convinced that the introduction of a slots system, will effectively administer the cap and will overall help reduce congestion and delays at Sydney Airport. This will have a flow&hyphen;on beneficial effect as so much domestic aviation traffic is affected by good performance at KSA.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 2 of the bill establishes a cap of 80 movements per hour at KSA, and requires Airservices Australia to monitor compliance with the cap. Airservices Australia is also required to report any breaches of the cap. These reports will be tabled in both Houses of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In allocating slots, hourly movements are to be measured every 15 minutes. As I noted earlier this will assist in alleviating the practice of cluster scheduling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under clauses 7 and 8 it will be possible to lower the maximum number of hourly movements at KSA after consultation with interested parties. However, any change to the cap must be made in the form of a disallowable instrument which must go before the parliament for the full disallowance period before it would come into effect. The capacity to lower the maximum number of hourly movements is essentially a reserve provision. The cap of 80 remains our policy.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 3 of the bill establishes a system of penalties for unauthorised aircraft movements. This will protect the integrity of the cap and establish clear guides for all users of KSA as to the range of sanctions which may levied if an infringement occurs.  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unauthorised movements will be subject to penalties in the form of an infringement notice or civil prosecution. A range of civil penalties have been specified in relation to breaches of the slot allocation system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most serious of these breaches relates to no&hyphen;slot movements, where an aircraft lands or takes off without having permission to do so. This is a fundamental breach of the slot system which jeopardises the cap and disrupts other airports users who have applied for a slot. A no&hyphen;slot movement will be punishable by a maximum penalty of $220,000 per infringement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maximum penalty for an off&hyphen;slot movement is $110,000 for a corporation, or $22,000 for an individual. It is proposed that the Compliance Scheme will provide initially for relatively small fines but persistent offenders will find an exponential increase in the level of fines for the second and third offences&mdash;up to the maximum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is worth noting that fines are not triggered unless a flight is more than 15 minutes late, and off&hyphen;slot movements which are outside the control of the airline will not count.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Emergency and state aircraft will be exempt from this part of the bill. In addition, the Slot Manager may grant, within approved guidelines, a dispensation to certain aircraft. The guidelines will be a disallowable instrument as part of the Slot Management Scheme and will therefore be subject to further scrutiny by this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Revenue received from penalties are to be used by industry to off&hyphen;set the costs of administering the Slot Management Scheme. This signifies that the government is not aiming at raising revenue under the Scheme. Rather, we are serious about improving poor performance and delays.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is the first of seven in the legislation package designed to give effect to the government's announcement in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget that it would be cracking down on fuel substitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been a longstanding and well accepted policy of successive governments that where excise is imposed on petroleum products, differential rates 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7383"> of duty are applied on the basis of the intended end&hyphen;use of the product. The highest rate of customs and excise duty is imposed on fuels such as gasoline and automotive diesel oil for onroad transport use. For example, unleaded gasoline and automotive diesel oil are subject to duty at the current rate of 34.697 cents per litre. Burner fuels such as fuel oils, heating oils and kerosene, attract a concessional excise duty rate which is currently 7.200 cents per litre. Petroleum products for non&hyphen;fuel use purposes, such as solvents, do not attract excise duty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The specifications for some concessional and zero&hyphen;rated petroleum products, such as solvents, may be very similar to those for onroad fuels, particularly automotive diesel oil. Accordingly, substitution of lower duty products for onroad uses is attractive to unscrupulous operators. For example, if product declared as a solvent at the terminal gate of a major oil company is subsequently blended with automotive diesel oil by a party in the retail distribution system, the windfall gain from this fraud is 34.697 cents per litre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Excise revenue from petroleum products is not insignificant in terms of its contribution to revenue and it is important that it be protected. The 1997&hyphen;98 budget estimate for collection of excise on petroleum products is $10 840 m, which includes a small amount of excise on crude oil. This is expected to form about 8.1 per cent of total Commonwealth revenue in this financial year. The 1997&hyphen;98 budget estimated that the measures underpinned by this legislative package will lead to increased revenue of $25 m in a full year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well as a fraud on the government and the honest taxpayer, these practices designed to avoid paying the correct excise are also a fraud on consumers and on those honest participants who form the vast majority of the petroleum products distribution and retail system who wish to compete on level terms. In many cases, use of these fuels can greatly harm engine performance and expose consumers to great danger as the blends containing substituted fuel may have a much lower flashpoint than proper diesel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government considers these fraudulent and potentially dangerous practices designed to avoid excise revenue legislated by the parliament as simply not acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has decided the best way to minimise these practices is to require the introduction of chemical tracers to concessional fuels before they enter home consumption. The tracer, described as a marker in the legislation, will allow Customs to monitor products in the market place to ensure inappropriate usage of concessional fuels does not occur. The presence of the marker will make illegal substitution simple to detect, both by Customs and by participants in the market who wish to do so.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This first bill in the package, the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill, restructures the excise tariff and defines those concessional products which must have the prescribed marker added to them prior to the entry into home consumption. In the case of products produced in the refineries operated by the major oil companies, this process will occur prior to the relevant product leaving the terminal gate and entering the distribution system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An Industry/Customs Technical Implementation Group with representation from the four major oil companies and the Australian Institute of Petroleum (AIP) will make recommendations to the government on practical implementation of the new requirements, including the identity of the preferred marker or markers which will then be subject to regulation. The identity of the marker will be made known with sufficient lead time to allow ready compliance. The industry accepts that it will bear the cost of the marker and its administration to concessional products. In this context, the Technical Implementation Group will provide advice to the government on a regime which will be simple to administer and minimise compliance costs on all parties involved in fuel manufacture and distribution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certain products which are excisable at rates below the rate for onroad fuels will not be required to be marked. These include aviation turbine fuel and aviation gasoline and all concessional fuels in packages not exceeding 210 litres, that is, drum and retail stock. The government will closely monitor the consumption of fuels with an exemption from the marking requirement to verify that abuse does not occur.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Customs Tariff (Fuel Rates Amendments) Bill in the legislative package imposes customs duty on imported product according to the intended end&hyphen;use at the time the product is entered into home consumption (in a parallel manner to excise). Three further bills impose a penalty surcharge on subsequent users who misuse, blend or sell the products other than in accordance with the originally intended end&hyphen;use as indicated by the marker. The Administration bill provides for record&hyphen;keeping obligations, audit and investigation powers for Customs officers, and offences for non&hyphen;compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the implementation of the measures, Customs has engaged in extensive consultation with parties with an interest. As well as the major oil companies and the AIP, other parties involved in the consultation program include the Australian Petroleum Agents and Distributors Association (APADA), the Service Station Association (SSA), the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA), the Road Transport Forum (RTF), the National Farmers Federation (NFF), state motoring organisations such as the NRMA and RACV, numerous individual fuel 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7384"> recycling companies and Offices of state Revenue and state consumer affairs bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While there has also been strong support in broad terms for the initiative amongst those consulted, the government recognises that there is significant detail in the legislative package. If substantiated and genuine concerns about the operation of the measures are apparent, the government will take these into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, I reiterate that the government is introducing these measures to increase compliance with long established excise taxation policy and to address loopholes in existing excise legislation where it does not deliver this policy. They will be of benefit to government in terms of collecting the proper excise revenue legislated by the parliament, to consumers in terms of safer petroleum products and to those honest participants who form the vast majority of the petroleum products distribution and retail system who wish to compete on level terms.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It sets out the administration provisions for the 3 penalty surcharge bills in the legislation package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first set of administration provisions relate to the times at which the penalty surcharges will become payable. The penalty surcharges are payable before the use, sale or blending takes place. It is highly unlikely that those who are carrying out these practices designed to defraud the revenue will volunteer to pay such surcharges and accordingly an offence will be committed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In such cases, the severe penalties are designed to act as a deterrent to these practices, particularly where they are carried out on a commercial scale. The penalties are high and reflect the serious nature of the frauds currently being perpetrated. It will be relatively easy for bona fide operators, who form the vast majority of participants in the industry, not to become involved. They will achieve that by not buying fuel without due attention to the required documentation and the commercial context in which the fuel is offered. In addition, a key factor in the selection of the marker (or markers) will be that the presence of the marker can be tested by those who wish to do so with a test that is safe, cheap and easy to conduct. There will be an intensive publicity campaign directed at industry participants before the legislation commences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second set of administration provisions relate to record creation and record keeping obligations which apply to all persons dealing in petroleum products. These requirements will apply to persons who enter products for home consumption as well as to subsequent dealers in such products after they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7385"> have entered into home consumption. There should be no situation, whether it be in a road tanker or other fuel transport vehicle of any type, a transport vehicle with a fuel capacity above the threshold limit, a depot, a service station or other fuel distribution or storage place, where fuel is not covered by some form of readily accessible and accurate documentary record. Customs has consulted with industry representative bodies in the petroleum product manufacturing, distribution and retail sector. The record keeping requirements set out in the bill, while codified into certain classes of records, are no more in quantity than is currently required by normal business practice. It should be noted also that volumes of fuel below certain levels will be exempted from the recordkeeping requirements and accordingly private motorists and other low volume users of fuel will not be affected in any way by these requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further administration provisions set out the notification requirements in relation to the sale or disposal of marked fuel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also sets out the audit powers of Customs officers and officers of other agencies authorised by the Chief Executive Officer of Customs to ensure compliance with the requirements in this act and to obtain evidential material concerning any breaches of the provisions of this act, including the authority to obtain monitoring and search warrants. The powers will cover a range of activities including fuel sampling, auditing of documents and access to various premises including road tankers and fuel transport vehicles, transport vehicles with a fuel capacity above the threshold limit and depots, service stations and fuel distribution or storage places. Unfortunately, the experience to date shows that once fuel has passed out of Customs' control into home consumption, the ability of Customs under existing legislation to obtain sufficient evidence to substantiate evasion of the revenue through fuel substitution practices is limited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that the bill allows information or things, such as fuel samples, to be made available to other agencies, whether Commonwealth or state, with relevant interests. Among other things, this power recognises that fuel substitution practices are designed to avoid state and territory petroleum franchise fee revenue, as well as excise.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to comment on the fact that in that vote yet again Senator Harradine abstained from determining the matter, and I intend to continue to refer to this because it is tantamount to determination of the Senate's affairs in absentia. We are in the situation where the senator comes in to make a deliberative vote if he wants to vote something down but stays out, knowing that it will go down, if the government is going to get a tied vote. This is the second or third time that it has happened today, and I just think that it is a bad practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are odd occasions when one has no option but to abstain because one cannot make a deliberated decision, but I cannot believe that this has suddenly overtaken Senator Harradine's consideration. It would be

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is fortuitous that I have come into the chamber. I am glad that Senator Brown has made this point because the situation is this: I knew precisely what the motion was before the chair. I had been studying it, I had heard the arguments put for and against, and I had seen it in full colour on my screen. Indeed, very often it is easier to follow a debate on the screen in the silence of your office where you are not distracted by interjections and all the rest of the things like that. Also, the focus is right on the senator who is speaking and you can give your undivided&mdash;in so far as it is undivided&mdash;attention to what is being said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But is it the case with every other senator that they knew what the debate was all about? That vote, might I say, was negatived on 27 votes to 27. Did Senator Brown say, `Where are the other 22 senators who were not here in the chamber?' No. Twenty&hyphen;two senators were missing from that vote. I happened to be one of them. I also happened to be aware of what the debate was about, and I also happened to know what the result would be if there were a division. I knew jolly well that the result would be a negative result, and that is also my point: knowing that, why should I come down to the chamber when there is a huge amount of work to do, such as committee work and the like; constituent work; and studying, and getting advice on, what is coming before the chamber?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As honourable senators know, in the unfortunate situation that one finds oneself, I have had to sit for hour on hour in this seat when other senators are not around the place and are doing other work&mdash;no doubt many of them are watching the debate on the screen. But let me make it clear to Senator Brown that I know precisely what effect my absence in certain cases here has. Do you want me to press a button or something? Why should I walk down here on all of those different occasions? </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind you of last Wednesday when Senator Murray and a senator on the Labor side&mdash;I am not sure who&mdash;were moving very good and attractive amendments to the  Legislative Instruments Bill . As you would recall, maybe a dozen of those votes came down to my vote. On that occasion I happened to be in the chamber. I think that Senator Ferguson was in the chair, as were others. They kept looking at me to see whether I would say No or Yes. It was ludicrous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also perfectly well aware of what the result would be in a tied vote when you have a situation where the House of Representatives sends back a bill indicating that it disagrees with our amendment. I am perfectly well aware that the government would normally move that the Senate does not insist upon its amendments. That, in a tied vote situation, is negatived. But the ruling over the years has been that, in fact, the Senate's amendments are not and cannot be insisted upon because they have lost the majority which would be normally required in the committee stage ab initio.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment is a stand-alone amendment similar to that which was put by Senator Murray. But it is different in that it extends the ability of parties&mdash;not only the Labor and Liberal parties and the Australian Democrats but also the Greens and, indeed, Senator Harradine&mdash;to have their policies assessed by Treasury. Under this amendment, Senator Harradine will be able to put forward his policies for assessment&mdash;if he comes in when there is a vote on this matter and votes for it. So, for the interest of those who have been following this matter in committee, I am essentially putting the embellishment on the Democrat amendment that we debated earlier in the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is allowing the government and opposition parties to put policies to Treasury to have the fiscal impact of those policies assessed so the public can get an independent arbitration as to whether the cost or the benefits of those policies are in line with what the parties say they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment means that the Democrats, the Greens and other parties who have representation in the parliament would also be able to put their policies before Treasury to have them assessed. I find it very difficult to argue

Of course, the Labor opposition supported the Australian Democrat amendment that was just before us a moment ago and which was defeated on a tied vote. In the debate leading into the putting of that motion to this chamber, I had indicated to the minor parties that we were not yet of a firm view as to what we would do with respect to this amendment, but I did indicate that I was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7390"> disposed to support it for parties that had at least one representative in the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators will recall this is a new amendment. The previous amendment meant that any party registered under the Commonwealth Electoral Act would be eligible for costing.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">minor party leader</EMPHASIS>  means the representative of any party which:</PARA>

That is to say that, if a minor party had a member in either chamber of the federal parliament at one time in its history, for ever after, whether or not they ever succeeded in being elected to the parliament again, they could submit at each election their program for costing by the Commonwealth Treasury.

<PARA STYLE="Para">The running sheet headed Revised 2 contains an Australian Democrats amendment to clause 3 of the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. I am returning to an area of discussion and argument that we had earlier for the first amendment we addressed today. I place this amendment before the Senate as a fall&hyphen;back and a lesser position, which I hope this time will attract the support of both Senator Margetts and Senator Harradine and the renewed support of the Labor Party and Senator Brown. This amendment focuses purely on parts 7 and 8 of the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want parts 7 and 8 of the bill to put back legally enforceable rights into the bill. These two parts focus only on pre-election reports on the fiscal and economic outlook and on pre-election policy costings. The amendment would make them enforceable. At the moment under the current legislation, the non-publication of these reports and costings would not be subject to judicial enforcement or to similar enforcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the other parts to this bill, parts 7 and 8 are clearly separate from any executive power of the Commonwealth, which requires it to follow whatever fiscal strategy it deems necessary. This part of the bill refers only to the fiscal reporting requirements relative to pre&hyphen;election matters. Parts 7 and 8 do not impact on the discretion of the executive government when it is in caretaker mode to run the national economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it stands, and as we said earlier, this bill is overly protective of the executive government at the expense of the parliament and the public. By accepting this amendment, the government will be reinforcing its commit 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment to the electorate to improve fiscal accountability while, at the same time, not encroaching in any way on the ability and the constitutional right of the executive government to run the national economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I do not expect you to support this&mdash;because that is not the way of things&mdash;but I am hopeful that you might reconsider your position, since this is a narrower version. I challenge you to take up the opportunity to demonstrate that you intend your charter of budget honesty to be enforceable. I hope that, as a consequence, you will provide the electorate and us with some firm statement of your determination to be accountable in this matter.

I wonder whether we might hold over consideration of this amendment until we see exactly how the government and the opposition respond to the Democrats' amendments 3 and 6. Not only would it be useful for me to know what the bill looks like but I might also be able to then ask the committee whether we could reconsider clause 3. That is what I should have done at the time. I am sorry that I did not do so but sometimes things happen very quickly.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) to the achievement of full employment in Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv) to the overall economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The amendment is fundamentally important in terms of the objectives of government. The opposition believes that fiscal policy should be directed to worthwhile community goals. It should not just be about a cold&hyphen;blooded accountancy exercise. One could ask oneself: why do governments set fiscal objectives? They should do so to ensure that their broader objectives can be achieved. Amendment No. 1 proposes to add to the principles of sound fiscal management in clause 5. We consider that, at a minimum, these two further paragraphs should be added to these principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people, when they listened to what I read out earlier, will recognise these principles as those that are contained within the Reserve Bank legislation, which must be taken into account by the bank in the conduct of monetary policy in this country. I submit to the committee that they add a humanising element to the principles of sound fiscal management rather than a narrowly focused fixation on the bottom line and accountancy standards as currently contained in the bill. It is not merely appropriate that a statement of principles of fiscal management simply address the accounting criteria. Also, the application of fiscal management techniques has a very real impact on the lives and welfare of people and this should be recognised in the bill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For people's welfare to be enhanced and for their prosperity to increase, there has to be a focus on the achievement of full employment and on the economic wellbeing of Australians. The pursuit of better employment outcomes should be the key priority of the government. Unfortunately, we know that this has not been the case. Or, if it has been, the government has been a woeful failure on this front. The record for the last 12 months is truly unacceptable. The Australian economy has actually lost around 60,000 full&hyphen;time jobs in that period. That is, we have not even stayed still on the jobs front; Australia has actually gone backwards.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government actually created an employment committee of cabinet to supposedly focus policy on employment. That has to be marked down as a spectacular failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments seek to compel the government to focus on national welfare, as they obviously are not doing at the moment. I regard it as unbelievable that the government would not accept this amendment, because to do so would indicate that they do not support improved employment and they do not support an improvement in national welfare outcomes. I commend the amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the major methods by which the current government has indicated that it is moving towards full employment&mdash;I am not sure if full employment is actually a goal of the government; perhaps they might enlighten me&mdash;is the assumption that, if you deregulate the labour force, pull down wages and conditions far enough and make it easier to sack people, then in the end you will soak up unemployment. I am just wondering whether or not paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of the amendment will be sufficient in relation to what the current government has been doing for employment. If you just put `the achievement of full employment in Australia' and if you are working with a government that thinks that the achievement of full employment is achieved by simply pulling down wages and conditions, they might claim that they are doing that by continuing to put up new waves of industrial legislation which actually, in my opinion, have the opposite effect.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder whether there might be the ability to include `the maintenance and improvement of the real value of wages and conditions and the welfare of workers' so that it is seen as a dual goal.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`The prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia'&mdash;I do not know if that necessarily means quality of life.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will not be supporting these amendments. I think there a bit of confusion has entered the minds of senators in this debate about the means and the ends and the principles that should be applied to sound fiscal management. I point out to senators that the preamble in the charter already refers to the role of fiscal policy in maintaining the ongoing economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. Of course, as far as the government is concerned, this includes the goal&mdash;I might say that I am surprised you did not mention this, Senator Margetts&mdash;of sustainable economic growth and full employment. If we use the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7395"> sorts of arguments that have been put forward, you could infinitely extend what you believe to be principles. No&hyphen;one seems to have mentioned low inflation&mdash;which is pretty important to a lot of people&mdash;sustainable development, and the list could go on and on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We have covered in the preamble what the appropriate objectives of fiscal policy are. We will not be supporting this amendment. I do not wish to labour this point for too long, but the Labor Party lost the right to speak about full employment after 13 years and `the recession we had to have'. Because of your failures in that area you have lost the right to get up and lecture the people about this. We always remember the recession which we, apparently, `had to have', and which threw hundreds of thousands of workers out of a job. There was never a complaint from you, Senator Cook. In fact, you were always the person up here justifying it. So we do not need to be lectured by you with your pious comments, Senator Cook. You had your chance and you failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is committed to restoring prosperity and employment in this nation. One of the ways you do it is by having sound fiscal policies. If big government spending could create jobs we would have a surfeit of jobs in this country. A surfeit of debt has been left to us thanks to Senator Cook and his colleagues. The government has a commitment in this area, a commitment to increasing the prosperity of people, to making sure that wages can be related to productivity and to the growth which this will entail, to making sure that we work towards achieving full employment. This government has a huge commitment in this area. That is why we are doing these things. Part of the reason for the charter of budget honesty is to stop wreckers like the previous government, who come in and cause so much chaos and pretend that everything all right. Then, when we open the books, we find that is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook, you are entitled to your views, but spare us your piety on this matter. You have huge amounts of baggage on this issue. Senator Cook, I believe that you, among other former ministers in your party, given your dreadful record, have lost the right 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to talk about jobs in this country. You were not job creators; you were job destroyers.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No-one should underestimate the importance of the amendment that Senator Cook has moved. I am certainly not underestimating or taking lightly the government's resistance to it. The issue of full employment has a very precise and serious meaning in economics and in the general view of the population and those who comment on these matters. Classical economics&mdash;I must say, Senator Cook, I have never thought of you as classical; perhaps more as a sports model with a few years on the clock&mdash;says that full employment is about two to three per cent unemployment. Senator Cook well understands the importance of what he is putting down here and the guidance he is attempting to give government. The government does not want to be pushed in that direction because it will put a very onerous burden on it to deliver something which both sides of the house recognise is notoriously difficult to deliver on these days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overall economic prosperity and welfare of the Australian population are important additions, Senator Cook, to the principles of sound fiscal management in this bill. We say again and again that society does not serve economics; economics must serve society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amongst all the things you list, Minister, it is the job of your government to deliver to your fullest capabilities full employment, job security and the welfare and advancement of Australians. You would find it very difficult not to agree with those sentiments, but we all disagree as to the method of getting there. This is an attempt to commit you, if you like, to that direction&mdash;to a direction. Accordingly, I advise Senator Cook that the Democrats will be supporting his amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you had listened you would have noted my comments on the preamble and how the government would define that preamble. The preamble talks of `maintaining the ongoing economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia'. As far as the government is concerned, this includes the goal of sustainable economic growth and full employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray, I thought your peroration was fairly good. I was about to wish issue a `hear, hear!' But unfortunately you had a concluding sentence which did not appeal to me too much. This government is entirely focused on delivering growing employment in this country, setting the basis for that, and setting the prosperity for the security and welfare of this country. That is the goal. Sound fiscal policy is one of the means by which such a goal can be achieved. There are differences of opinion on the means to an end, and that is quite appropriately the subject of debate in this chamber. We think the policies you put forward are policies which are liable to increase unemployment, not reduce it. They would be liable to add to the insecurity of the Australian people, not increase it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make this government's commitment to sustainable growth absolutely clear. It is not the sort of growth we had under Labor: whoops, down it comes again; there is the recession we had to have. For months, as unemployment mounted and the queues of unemployed lengthened, we could not even get the former government to concede that there was a recession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, let me make it clear. There is no doubt about this government's commitment. That is why we have had to make some tough decisions&mdash;and, I might say, very rarely do we get support from the non-government parties for those tough decisions. A generous harvest will be reaped as a result of our policies for this country, and it will be because we had the guts to take a few of these tough decisions.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, have no doubt about our commitment to those goals. But this is not the part of the bill in which they should be included. This is to do with fiscal matters, and the preamble makes it very clear where we stand.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">In trying to flesh out the intention of government with regard to this bill, these two amendments further the process we have been engaged in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is certainly nothing wrong with the government's existing intention to ensure that its policy decisions have regard to their financial effects on future generations. No&hyphen;one is going to object to that, but what we say, once again, is that that leaves out and leaves open the potential for important considerations not to be brought into play by the government of the day. Those important considerations, as spelt out in amendments 3 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and 6, relate to the social implications of policy decisions and the environmental implications of policy decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our communities are increasingly understanding that the path we have come down has not delivered them all the benefits they should have realised and that we need policies which flavour economics with solid doses of ecologically sustainable development policies, environmental concern and, perhaps most of all, concern for our society and the communities that make it up. The purpose of environmental policies, of ecologically sustainable development policies and of economic and fiscal policies is to produce a society in which people are in harmony with each other and which has a good long&hyphen;term prospect of survival and maintenance, health and welfare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a big speech for a small amendment, but this is the thinking and the purpose which lies behind those intentions. As with our previous amendments, amendment No. 6 is intended to add to the requirements and details of the intergenerational report&mdash;which is a marvellous term, Minister, that you have introduced in your bill; it is a first&hyphen;rate idea&mdash;by putting in place considerations of social and environmental implications of policy decisions. Not only do we think that our amendment will force the government to consider these aspects of any financial decisions; it will also include the cost&hyphen;benefit analysis&mdash;and you are aware that I am keen on those&mdash;of social and environmental considerations in government fiscal policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All too often people on our side of politics believe that economic decisions which apparently deliver short&hyphen;term gain in fact deliver long&hyphen;term cost. That is something we have always been concerned about. Quite frankly, it is something that governments in the modern era are beginning to understand more and more. To add a compliment back to your bill once again, the longer term perspective you are trying to introduce in this bill encourages that kind of analysis and thought in the matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a little disagreement with Senator Murray; I think these are the most important amendments that he is bringing forward. The government is acting as if we are in a world in which only dollars count and in which policies can only be assessed according to the price tag that is put on them. But life is much wider than that; the values that people have for themselves, for their societies and for their children coming after them are much wider than that. As Senator Murray has indicated, a dollar led decision can be a catastrophe for the environment or for social order. We only have to look at the current smog blanket covering four or five nations to the north of us to see how fiscal policy&mdash;for example, the Suharto government's policy of allowing loggers wherever they liked into the Indonesian forests and encouraging the transmigration of millions of people&mdash;can lead to an environmental catastrophe, despite all the warnings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not to say that this would not be a big job, but the departments are there and they ought to be brought into this assessment no less than the Treasury&mdash;departments of the environment and departments to do with the delivery of social justice. We ought not to have economics being master of our destiny; it ought to be very much the servant. Ecological considerations and social considerations ought to be at the forefront. We ought to be putting future generations at the top of our consideration because if we do not we become a failed generation; we become a generation that gets looked at by those people of the future as one which was self&hyphen;invested and short&hyphen;sighted and which forgot about them. We cannot afford to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Murray's amendment does is move some way towards having parties contesting elections and being responsible for the environmental and social components of their policies. It is a sensible amendment and one has to worry about this nation when it has not been at the forefront of the government's consideration. Why has the government not moved this? How can you be honest about policies if you are not assessing the environmental and social outcomes of those policies? 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> How can you be honest if your eyes are not wide open to the impact on future generations of policies we are making now as far as their environment and as far as their right to social order are concerned, let alone those people who are going to be immediately affected by government policy? Of course you cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem here is that it is simple to talk dollars and it is complicated to talk environment and social wellbeing. But it is a default of the worst order to ignore the complexities and exemplify the simplicities. That is a very mistaken political outlook and it is one we should not countenance. If we were a more sane, level&hyphen;headed and caring society, and if we did have a long&hyphen;term view, we would have a charter in here which would make it incumbent upon us to look at the social and environmental ramifications of what we are doing in our policies, and we would have the government or the Democrats amending it to say, `We had better look at the dollars as well.' But that is not the way it is; the world is the other way round and we are going to pay increasing penalties because of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure the government is going to get up and say, `Oh dear, this is just too difficult. This is too complex. We want to put our heads in the sand. If we can't do that, we at least want to wash our hands of our environmental and social responsibilities.' That is not good enough. This is an extremely important amendment. I commend Senator Murray and the Democrats for putting it before the Senate and I hope it will be adopted.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Labor Party will not support this amendment. In saying that, it is not because we do not have sympathy for it. If I go to the text of this amendment, on page 7, what this amendment does is remove the words `financial effects on future generations' and replace those words with `financial and social effects on future generations and the implementation of the principles of ecologically sustainable development'. Let me just pause there before I go to the second part of amendment No. 6 that has been moved conjointly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This appears under the heading `Principles of sound fiscal management' and would be an amendment to (e) under that list of various 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7399"> items. The problem I have with this is: how is Treasury going to assess objectively the social effects of particular policy principles that are laid down either by the government or by the opposition&mdash;now that the minor parties cannot be involved because of a decision that I voted against&mdash;and only those two parties? I cannot see how Treasury would be able to do that. Nor do I see automatically that Treasury is the appropriate agency to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of it is on ecologically sustainable development. I think there is a definitional problem with what ecologically sustainable development is. Even if there was an agreed definition, to make an assessment against particular policy principles is an exercise which I think Treasury is ill&hyphen;equipped to do. Even if the agency were not Treasury but the environmental agency, there may be a considerable difference as to whether or not what everyone thought was the  definition of ecological sustainability was in fact being fairly applied. I know this sounds like a trite objection, but this has to work in practice after the writs have been issued in an election, when there is a relatively short amount of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In assessing the social impact of various economic measures, there is a huge amount of subjectivity involved, and the subjectivity brought to this issue will be brought by the assessing agency, Treasury. It will be the case, I suspect, that we will want to argue that the subjective principles on which they base their assessment are wrong, or that they do not fully comprehend the extent of the social implications that we would see as a political party. One of the reasons why I would oppose this is that it is in the cut and thrust of the last days of an election campaign when these reports are coming down. I must say that I think the government would have the same problem, but far less of a problem, because it is conservative and we are progressive. But in the cut and thrust of an election campaign, having a political party trying to debate whether Treasury is right or wrong with Treasury bureaucrats, does create a major political difficulty. It is for those reasons, not because I am out of sympathy with the objec 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tive but for the reasons of the practical application, that we oppose this. The same remarks can be made about clause 6.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an odd sort of statement that Senator Cook has made, inasmuch as when they were in government his party actually accepted the general principle of the kinds of accounts that we have been talking about, environmental and social accounts, that is, the full picture of what is happening within the wider economy. That is a principle that the previous government agreed to in relation to national accounts. They actually made statements that they would work towards including these things in national accounts. I understand that the Treasury already has an environmental economics unit associated with it. That is my understanding. If Senator Cook is suggesting that national accounts ought to be taken from Treasury and given to someone else, or that elements of national accounts ought to be given to someone else, that is a different matter altogether.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my understanding that Treasury are already looking at elements of how you include satellite accounting and how you include other elements that actually give you the whole picture of how the economy is going. So I am afraid that what Senator Cook has indicated does not hold water. As I say, Senator Faulkner, when the Labor Party were in government, indicated that they were prepared to move towards that kind of national accounting and that that might be a goal in the future. That was part of the various nice statements that have been made to the environment movement. The environment movement, I guess, had no choice but to believe that the Labor Party were serious when they made those statements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I just wonder whether Senator Cook has actually been talking to anyone else or has taken advice that in fact even Treasury, to my understanding, unless they have had those areas removed, has an environmental economic unit. I would like to think that they had some units which looked at equity considerations and social impacts, that is, in conjunction with national accounts, and whether or not there was an index on employment, on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7400"> equity and on greenhouse. There are methods that have been looked at not only in Australia but actually all around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a strong debate occurring within the OECD countries and there is a strong debate that is occurring within the European Union. There are copious tomes being written on how this can happen. There are countries which are doing this already. It is not impossible. What Senator Cook seems to suggest is that it is something that we have magically pulled out of thin air and has nothing at all to do with how national accounts can perhaps be run. I would strongly argue that this is my whole concern about how this bill has been put together: we are pretending that these things either don't exist or can't exist, or are somehow out of the purview of the way you present budgets and the way you present national accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would agree with Senator Brown that these two amendments, amendments Nos 3 and 6, are not just an addition to what is going on; they are in fact probably the most important element in what is being presented. Without them, it is in fact a charter of budget dishonesty, not a Charter of Budget Honesty, because it does not give the full picture. It pretends that it is giving the full picture but it is in fact giving a very narrow view of what national accounts are, a very narrow view of what even the economy consists of and the implications for the economy in the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I want to make some comments on the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation 1996&hyphen;97 annual report. As most senators would know, this organisation is funded by a compulsory four per cent levy on all wool growers of their gross returns. As the report outlines, the financial year 1996&hyphen;97 was a successful year for the organisation both in terms of the activities undertaken and the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> solid financial performance achieved. Its work was concentrated in the following areas: identifying strategic access and investment opportunities for Australian wool; researching and developing productivity improvements for land, labour and capital; encouraging investment and the take&hyphen;up of high quality Australian wool products; building on a competitive Australian export sector; protecting our natural resource base; and innovating with and marketing Australian wool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the chairmanship of Mr Alec Morrison, the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation has continued to focus on the crucial task of building demand for wool by developing new wool and wool&hyphen;blend products, sourcing new markets, strengthening existing ones and improving processing techniques. In a very difficult climate, the organisation has remained committed to its task. It was originally set up in 1993 under the legislation of the previous minister, Senator Bob Collins, who is in the chamber, and since that time it has been funded, as I said before, by the compulsory four per cent levy on all wool growers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This coming year is of vital importance to the future funding of the organisation because it will be reviewed by a voluntary vote taken by all wool taxpayers&mdash;they have to take up the option. That process is taking place now and they can then vote on the rate of future funding for the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation. Presently, as it is divided up, 3&half; per cent of the four per cent goes to the promotion side of its activities and the other half a per cent goes to research in Australia and overseas. The total amount raised is about $100 million and the organisation, in conjunction with its sister organisation, the International Wool Secretariat, has a budget of around $150 billion and it has that extra finance through a number of strategic alliances with a number of users of the Woolmark and other related business programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The organisation has a big job to do because, of course, you can improve the price of a product in two ways&mdash;one is by promoting it properly and the other is by the producers taking a lower price than is sustainable for them. For most of the 1990s, producers of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7401"> wool have certainly taken a lower price than was economically viable, but there is some hope and some prospects that the wool price is improving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect is the promotion one and in that area the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation is exceptionally important. As I said, the future funding level of the organisation is being debated within industry circles at this time, and wool growers will have the chance to make some impact on the future funding arrangements for their organisation. The Wool Council of Australia has recommended, on behalf of the primary industry producer organisations in each state, that the funding remain the same&mdash;at four per cent&mdash;and I imagine that will be the decision taken by wool growers. But, whatever it is, all wool growers demand a very high degree of expertise, a very high degree of accountability and a very high degree of performance, and I am pleased to see that the management and directors of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation are providing a higher level of accountability and disclosure of their activities than ever before and I encourage them in that regard.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The sad truth is that at the moment the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is in a state of absolute crisis and the public are entitled to have absolutely no trust or confidence in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> way in which air safety regulation is currently being administered in this country. It saddens me to make that statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of fact that, indeed, had it not been for other matters relating to travel, the crisis that has enveloped the safety authority in the last few weeks would have been given far more public prominence in the press than it has had to this point in time, because it is, indeed, a crisis arising as a result of some extraordinary events that occurred at the last CASA board meeting in September this year, just a few weeks ago. Among those present at that board meeting were the four new appointments&mdash;that is, the appointments by the now departed Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp&mdash;led by the deputy chair and now acting chair of CASA, Mr Dick Smith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of extraordinary events happened at that meeting. Justice Fisher, the then chair who has since resigned, asked those four board members whether it was true that they had given written notice to the minister&mdash;an unprecedented act in all of my time in politics&mdash;that, as a condition of their appointment, they would resign, if so requested, from those positions. Immediately after that confirmation and with no prior notice, those four board members moved peremptorily a vote of no confidence in the chief executive of CASA, Mr Leroy Keith, leading to his immediate resignation, which was immediately followed by the resignation of the chair of CASA and the other remaining members of the board. That motion of no confidence was passed four to three.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who was Mr Leroy Keith? Who were these four recent appointments to head Australia's premier safety regulation authority getting rid of? Leroy Keith was an American citizen who was recruited from the United States to that position after gaining over 30 years of the most high&hyphen;level experience in senior positions in the Federal Aviation Authority in the United States in safety regulation, culminating in his position as a deputy president of McDonnell Douglas, one of the largest aviation companies in the world. When he came to us from the United States, he was the general manager of quality with McDonnell 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7402"> Douglas as well as being the vice&hyphen;president of the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was an officer who enjoyed, unusually, the full confidence of not just the government and the minister, Mr Sharp, who expressed that confidence publicly only in April this year, but of the opposition as well. All senators who have attended the Senate estimates committees would know of Mr Leroy Keith's attendance at those committees. His competence was obvious to everyone. He enjoyed the confidence of industry in Australia. The minister, as I say, expressed that confidence earlier this year when he said in a press release headed, `Breakthrough in safety regulation':</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on a matter that has arisen in the South Australian election campaign. Earlier this week I made a speech on the adjournment about the so&hyphen;called `Dale Baker affair', in which Mr Baker had given evidence to the Anderson inquiry into his conflict of interest over a purchase of property while he was a minister for primary industry and forests in South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said in that statement that, according to advice I had received, the reason the Premier had refused to table the report&mdash;although he had promised to do so when it was first commissioned&mdash;was that Dale Baker had alleged that the President of the Liberal Party of South Australia, Mr Martin Cameron, was involved in undermining him, Dale Baker, and bringing to light the issue which led to his demise as a minister. At the time I made 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7403"> those remarks the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, interjected saying that it was a pretty weak allegation, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to point out that on the following Tuesday morning, that is, yesterday, Mr Tim Anderson clearly confirmed in an interview on ABC radio in Adelaide that Dale Baker had named Mr Martin Cameron, the President of the Liberal Party, as being involved in a campaign to undermine him on this issue. That is on the record&mdash;on ABC radio. So what I raised on Monday night in this place was correct, despite the best efforts of Senator Hill to disparage my remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to go on to another matter which the ubiquitous Mr Martin Cameron, the President of the Liberal Party of South Australia, has been involved in. All I have to do is read a press release issued yesterday, 30 September, publicly in South Australia by the Combined Shooters and Firearms Council of South Australia. I will read the press release. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal Party has indicated it would be prepared to do a backflip on guns and allow people to keep pump action and semi automatic shotguns in return for the Combined Shooters &amp; Firearms Council of SA urging its members to back off in their opposition to the Liberal Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The president of the council, Mr Michael Hudson, said that late last week a senior representative of the Council was invited to Liberal Party Headquarters by the Party's president, Mr. Martin Cameron, to discuss ways of placating the State's firearms owners and users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"One of our senior members, Immediate Past President Mr. Rob Low, attended the meeting and, over a cup of coffee, Mr. Cameron sought ways of appeasing sporting shooters," Mr Hudson said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He indicated that the Government might consider legislation to allow people to keep pump action and semi automatic shotguns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, Mr. Cameron was told that his offer was pointless, considering that most people have had their firearms `confiscated' and melted down.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The press release continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr. Cameron obviously realises that the liberal Government has made a serious error of judgement and will pay a dear price at the October 11 election when tens of thousands of firearms owners and users are expected to vote for the United Australia Party in protest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Council will not be bought off by Mr. Cameron's offer. It is too little too late. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On October 11, the Liberal Government will discover&mdash;to its dismay&mdash;that by meekly bowing to Prime Minister Howard, many of its back benchers will join thousands of other South Australians on the dole queue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This offer&mdash;be it an official offer or an unofficial plea for help from Mr. Cameron&mdash;will not be accepted, and nor will it be followed up. The Liberals as, the old saying goes, will reap what they have sown.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At the bottom of the press release it tells you that for further information you can get interviews with Michael Hudson and it gives his telephone number. Again, that was issued by the Combined Shooters and Firearms Council of South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Isn't it extraordinary that we have on the day on which the 12&hyphen;month firearm amnesty ends, which was yesterday, the President of the Liberal Party of South Australia trying to undermine his own Prime Minister, his own Attorney-General and the unanimous decision&mdash;with the exception of one or two members in the lower house&mdash;of the federal parliament to ban firearms such as the pump action and semi&hyphen;automatic shotguns  in Australia, which is what everybody in Australia, except that firearm lobby, wanted to happen after that awful tragedy at Port Arthur last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party in South Australia is now so desperate to get votes that it is willing to undermine its own policy and offer a possible legislative change in South Australia after the election to allow people to again have pump action and semi&hyphen;automatic shotguns.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard claimed enormous credit for this agreement, and he was fully and unanimously supported by the Labor Party. We make no bones about our position.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I only want to speak briefly for five minutes, because I understand that later Senator Calvert will be tabling an important document&mdash;a report on the visit of a parliamentary friendship group to Ireland. At the outset, I want to thank Senator Calvert, who was chairman of the Australia&hyphen;Irish Parliamentary Friendship Group, and Senator McKiernan and his wife Jackie particularly for their involvement in the preparation of this trip.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This trip took a long time to prepare, and we had the cooperation of the Irish Embassy; the Irish Ambassador, Richard O'Brien; together with the Irish parliament, which hosted us for one week while we were there. That made this an enjoyable trip not only because of the make&hyphen;up of the people of this bi&hyphen;partisan delegation but also because of the important information that was gained by us in Ireland, which has been regarded by many people in Europe today as Europe's modern miracle, particularly in an economic sense. So I want to particularly thank those people involved in the preparation of this trip. It was done over a long period and done with excellence. I would particularly like to thank Senator Calvert and Senator McKiernan for their roles in preparing for this trip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to speak a lot about the trip because there are a lot of other speakers who will be commenting on the aspects of the trip. The important aspect was us getting the opportunity to have a first&hyphen;hand look at their economy, how they have managed to turn their economy around in such a short time and how they are now one of the leading lights of Europe. There were many things that were gained on this trip in what was a hectic 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7405"> program which will be beneficial for a long time to all of those that went. I say it was beneficial because, as a group of backbenchers, I think there can sometimes be more importance placed on backbenchers going away and seeing the sorts of things that happen, because backbenchers from both parties, after all, do have input at committee level on the sorts of policies that we want to have in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to particularly make comments on some comments that were made on the return of this delegation from Ireland, particularly on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">John Laws Show</EMPHASIS> on 15 September. I have never listened to John Laws, and after reading a transcript of his program that morning, I doubt if I will ever listen to John Laws. I thought some of the remarks he made about members of our delegation were quite outrageous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a member of the Liberal Party, I take exception to some remarks that were made about some colleagues and friends who went on that trip, particularly those from the Labor Party. I will read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the end of the interview conducted by John Laws where he was trying to chase around every member of parliament who had travelled overseas during the winter break. This is how he concludes his interview:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Here's another one. One of the handmaidens tried the same line and I said I'd let you know how we went.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is him trying to track down members of parliament. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is what one said. This is amusing. Ted Grace, you know the famous Ted Grace? Oh, Prime Ministerial material, Ted! Ted Grace, one of the MPs who went to Ireland, he said: There's always benefit to Australia when politicians go overseas'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then John Laws laughs and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yeah, you're right, Ted. Quite right. Trouble is you come back.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that is the most outrageous attack on a member of parliament going away on a parliamentary delegation. He was a well&hyphen;respected member of parliament who served in the other place for a considerable length of time. For somebody as ignorant of the affairs of this delegation as John Laws obviously was to make that sort of statement about a parlia 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mentary colleague, where the person has absolutely no right of reply, even though that colleague is not from my party, having travelled with him for a week and working with him on other committees, is outrageous. He also said of former Senator Bruce Childs:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . you've never heard of these people, of course you haven't because they do bugger all except take your money and travel overseas. Senator Bruce Childs. Did you know we had a Senator called Bruce Childs? He retired from Parliament on September 10th, which makes you wonder why he went on a trip to North and South America when he was leaving the job a few weeks later.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Here is a former senator who was held in the highest regard in this place. You do not have to be a member of parliament who is read in the papers every day of the week or sensationalised by people like John Laws to make a significant contribution to this parliament and to this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the best contributions I have seen have been from those people who quietly work away doing their job, as Senator Childs did here for some 16 or 17 years. To see him spoken about by someone like John Laws on a radio program makes me quite sure that I will never listen to John Laws because I think those sorts of ill-informed and totally ignorant comments have no place on the airwaves of Australia. If he wants to make those sorts of remarks, let him do some proper research and find out what contribution these people have made to the parliament.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7406">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I wanted to use the short time available to comment on the economic growth of Ireland and its industry policy. I think there has been some misinterpretation here in Australia about what we should be doing with regard to attracting investment and trying to copy Ireland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will start with some background. Ireland has had fantastic economic growth for the last three years&mdash;seven and eight per cent real growth per year. Going back to 1996, they were a cot case. IMF was about to come in, government debt was 123 per cent of GDP, GDP incomes per capita were 20 per cent below OECD average and in 10 years they have lifted themselves up to be equal to the OECD average. It is just a fantastic effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been enormous investment in Ireland. People have interpreted that this investment has basically been driven by tax concessions. Sure, Ireland started off in 1986 offering tax concessions to businesses to invest there, with a 10 per cent corporate tax rate. But that applied to the manufacturing industry. They had no manufacturing industry, so it was easy for them to do that. Some years later they widened the advantage and it also applied to services, but only for services that were exported out of Ireland. For instance, if a bank invested in Ireland, they had to ring&hyphen;fence their export activity from their internal activity&mdash;a 36 per cent tax rate on internal activity and 10 per cent on external activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the government people we spoke to emphasised that a lot of investment was not really tax driven. I visited the National Irish Bank because I knew they had spoken to a lot of businesses. I also visited Hewlett-Packard personally. The managers of the bank and the managers of Hewlett-Packard stressed that the main reason they invested in Ireland was, first of all, because it was an easy entry into Europe; the second reason was good people and a good education system. They said that good people were available in Ireland. With regard to education, the emphasis in Ireland is on the three Rs. The common comment from the investors who invested there was, `Well, Senator, would you believe they still teach grammar here', which the business 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people found very attractive. The third priority was a tax incentive, but it was in that order and not the other way around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the implication for us here in Australia is that it is impossible for us to go chasing Singapore and Ireland with 10 per cent corporate tax rates versus the 36 per cent corporate tax rates. I do not think that will work. What is more important is for us to sell our advantages as part of the Asia-Pacific region, because we have good people here. We have to emphasise education and training of our people and put more emphasis on training people in the IT industries, for instance, which have been very successful in Ireland. There is a huge increase in demand for people with IT skills across the economic commerce area worldwide. We can do that in Australia. We are really competitive in that area and we should do more about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst we were in Ireland, the Prime Minister announced an additional 5,000 tertiary places that very week. He said, `After conferring with industry, I'm announcing 5,000 additional places that the government is going to support&mdash;2,000 in the electronics area, 2,000 in computer programming and 1,000 for language skills for core centres.' They identified those needs between government and industry. That is what they were investing in&mdash;education and the skills base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a very worthwhile trip to Ireland. I think there were great messages from that visit which have great relevance to industry policy here for Australia. I am delighted that I was part of the group. It was very worthwhile.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7406"><TITLE>South Pacific Cruise Lines Ltd</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak about the Senate estimates committee hearing that is being held today, sitting concurrently with the sitting of the Senate, in relation to the South Pacific Cruise Lines fiasco that has been presided over by Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen today is the most extraordinary situation of the government 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7407"> deliberately hindering a Senate estimates committee hearing. Of course, it has had good reason to do so: it wants to deliberately cover up Senator Vanstone's handling of the $2.7 million South Pacific Cruise Lines fiasco.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just a few moments ago we heard that, although Senator Vanstone first knew about these problems on 11 and 12 June, she did not raise the issue with her departmental secretary, Mr Sedgwick, until late August. It is absolutely extraordinary. No wonder officers at the Senate estimates committee today have been so embarrassed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a situation where an order of the Senate allowed the DEET estimates committee to sit today to deal with the specific matter of the South Pacific Cruise Lines issue. It was a clear order of the Senate. So apparently this is something that the government could not cope with and they had to come up with a political strategy to deal with it. But what they came up with was extraordinary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was this: the government members of the committee flouted the standing orders of the Senate and flouted the terms of reference of the committee, which was to examine Minister Vanstone's cruise ship fiasco, in order to attempt to protect their minister, Senator Vanstone. I suppose it is an honourable enough motive. After all, Senator Vanstone needs all the help she can get. They resorted to the most extraordinary diversionary and filibustering tactics to prevent facts emerging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone was away all last week and is going to go off again for another couple of weeks, so it is very difficult for us then to get parliamentary scrutiny of this scandal, this fiasco, that Senator Vanstone is both responsible for and has presided over. The excuse that government members of the committee used to try to soak up at least half the time of the Senate estimates committee was most extraordinary. They tried to find a benchmark for Labor's Working Nation program against which the South Pacific Cruise Lines fiasco could be judged. That was the excuse they were using. They could not do that, of course, but that was a very blatant, very transparent attempt to obstruct parlia 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mentary scrutiny of a financial disaster that was all Minister Vanstone's own work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we had the embarrassing spectacle of government senators asking dorothy dix questions to Minister Vanstone, but even more importantly to DEETYA officers who brought along their prepared briefs to deal with a whole range of labour market programs and Working Nation programs, matters that they tried to trawl through which went back six or seven years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had the embarrassment of an officer at the table with a formal brief on a number of successful Labor government programs. What an extraordinary coincidence! What luck it was that this officer of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs was able to bring the brief and there was a whole series of nicely typed out and prepared dorothy dix questions for the lackeys that the government senators on the committee asked ad nauseam at the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth of the matter is that the Liberal committee members could not find one other example of an appalling failure of process such as that which Senator Vanstone was involved in. There is nothing comparable to the fiasco that she has presided over. There is nothing comparable to the massive mismanagement of the minister's own responsibilities, nothing comparable to the cover-up that occurred in the minister's office and amongst members of her staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It said it all when we were able to establish that on 11 or 12 June Senator Vanstone knew about this issue but did not bother even raising it in any way&mdash;formal or informal&mdash;with the head of her department, the secretary of DEETYA, Mr Sedgwick, until well over two months later, in late August. That says it all about Senator Vanstone's administration of her own portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we really have learnt how a Liberal government minister runs her own office. We have heard that briefs might go to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, and a dropped copy goes to Senator Vanstone. But Senator Vanstone under no circumstances would sign off the brief herself; she would have a DLO 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7408"> sign off the brief. She would not bother reading it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have letters from coalition members of parliament, like Mr Slipper and Mr Jull, to Senator Vanstone. Of course, she does not actually look at the letters that come to her and does not respond to them. It takes her months and months to respond to them. If I were Mr Slipper or Mr Jull, I would object most strongly to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a brief to Senator Vanstone herself on Mr Jull's correspondence which raises a range of serious issues related to the South Pacific Cruise Lines fiasco. That is completely unsigned. That is a brief that went to Minister Vanstone on 16 May. She has not signed that at all. So we have a situation where many of these briefs in Dr Kemp's and Minister Vanstone's office do not appear to be date stamped as they are received. It is a shemozzle in Minister Vanstone's office. No wonder she takes the cake as the most incompetent of the Liberal government ministers&mdash;which is saying something in a government that is reeling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think there is any doubt; you have only to read the editorials, the newspapers and listen to members of her own party bag her mercilessly when you get the opportunity to have a private conversation. It is great to hear it, really. Even members of the government parties know that Minister Vanstone is not up to it. It is all right&mdash;I will not name them. They are all very relieved over there, aren't they? I can see a few grins. It is all right, I am not going to name anyone. You are all in the clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us face it, it has been shown today that Minister Vanstone is either bone lazy, completely incompetent or utterly stupid. There is no other excuse for what has occurred in relation to this matter. I have to say that it has done those Liberal senators who went to that meeting today&mdash;a hearing held as a result of a clear direction and order of the Senate&mdash;no credit to try to bring up every possible extraneous issue under the sun and waste hour after hour of the Senate's time. It is a pathetic tactic; it has been exposed in the media and, as a result, Senator Vanstone is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> even more condemned now for the administration of her own portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are entitled to seek explanations and answers for this massive mismanagement of nearly $3 million. We will not be put off by this miserable, low life political tactic; we will get to the heart of it. At the end of the day, Senator Vanstone will lose her responsibilities, as she deserves to. As I said, she is bone lazy, incompetent or stupid. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7408"><TITLE>Australia-Ireland Parliamentary Friendship Group</TITLE>

We had the pleasure of accepting a kind invitation from the former Speaker of the Irish parliament, Sean Tracey.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to give sincere thanks to my secretary, Senator Jim McKiernan, for his efforts; His Excellency Richard O'Brien, Ireland's Ambassador to Australia; Mr Eoin Faherty, who organised the program; Mr Seamus Pattison, the present Speaker; Senator Liam Cosgrove, Cathaoirleach, the President of the Senate; His Excellency Eddy Stevens, Australia's Ambassador to Ireland.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset, I would like to say that, by any standard, this delegation learned a lot. I believe we gave a lot and that the visit was of great benefit not only to all of us but to the Australian parliament. Whilst this particular friendship group is smaller than the Australia&hyphen;United States Parliamentary Friendship Group and the Australia&hyphen;United Kingdom Parlia 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7409"> mentary Friendship group, we are particularly active and we have hosted in Australia not only delegations but also visits by artists and authors, one of whom was Tim Pat Coogan who wrote <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Michael Collins: A biography</EMPHASIS>. We do pride ourselves as a group. As you would know, Madam Deputy President, 40 per cent of Australian people claim some Irish background, so it is important that we keep those links with our friends in Ireland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a group we were very privileged to be able to meet quite a wide selection of senior politicians very soon after the election of the new government. Amongst them were the Deputy Prime Minister, Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrats Party; the former Minister for Finance and the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, Mr Ruairi Quinn; the Minister for State and Foreign Affairs, Liz O'Donnell; and the Deputy Leader of Fine Gael, Ms Nora Owen. We also met other politicians at different events. One of the most important occasions, of course, was meeting the President of Ireland, Mary Robinson, who is leaving the presidency to take up a position with the United Nations. We were able to pass on our best wishes on behalf of the Australian government on that very important task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that our delegation was very interested in was the fact that the taxpayers of Australia, through our government and through the former government, are supplying something like &pound;3 million for the International Fund for Ireland. I know that my colleague Senator McKiernan, if he had the opportunity, would like to speak on this tonight. Unfortunately, he will not be able to do so, but I am looking forward to hearing him speak at a future time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The International Fund for Ireland plays a very important part in the peace process that is unfolding in Ireland and, in a small way, Australia plays a part in that. I know that the delegation was most impressed with the reception we received from those people. They were genuinely appreciative of the efforts of the Australian government and the Australian people even though, in numerical terms, the amount of money is not all that much. The results that are being achieved 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with this money, particularly at Dundalk and Carlingford, were very gratifying to us.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing I want to say is that a perusal of the report demonstrates the comprehensive nature of the program which was arranged for us by the parliament of Ireland. It certainly gives the lie to any claim or perception that such visits are mere junkets, and I join with the earlier remarks of Senator Ferguson, in particular, in condemning the remarks of John Laws in relation to this particular visit and also in relation to other colleagues of ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was not the only one who seemed to take umbrage at this particular visit of a delegation to Ireland. There was Matthew Horan and other print journalists who similarly made quite unjustified and unsubstantiated allegations about the nature of this visit. I urge them to digest the details of this report in the hope that they might change their views, although I suppose it is very difficult to change the views of journalists of that nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth mentioning that, following our visit, the Australian ambassador sent a cable to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in which he highlighted the value of this particular visit in terms of the way in which it made a very positive contribution 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7410"> towards fostering Australia&hyphen;Ireland relations. So that was the independent assessment of Australia's ambassador to Ireland, that this was an important and worthwhile visit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some lessons for Australia in what has been achieved in Ireland and Senator Gibson earlier this evening detailed the economic miracle that has occurred in Ireland over the last 10 years. I believe that principal among the lessons that can be learnt from the economic achievement of Ireland is what can be achieved if a government and a nation have, firstly, the political will and, secondly, the unity of purpose to set out a goal and then march towards it. Certainly the turnaround in the economy of Ireland that has been achieved over the past decade is a remarkable achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although 10 years ago the Irish economy was starting from a much lower base than other European Union countries, over that 10&hyphen;year period it has consistently outstripped the rest of the European Union as far as economic growth is concerned&mdash;year by year over the decade&mdash;albeit, of course, with some funding assistance from the European Community. Nevertheless, the policies that have been put in place have been the major factors contributing to that strong economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Undoubtedly, the policies that have been applied in Ireland are not necessarily directly transferable to the Australian situation, but there is much that can be learnt from them. Among the most important of those policy prescriptions was the strong emphasis placed by the Irish government, with the support of the opposition, other community leaders, indeed, the Irish community at large, on getting the government budget back into balance and paying off government debt. That was one of the main goals that was set forth in the program of economic recovery which has led to this strong economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another factor was the importance placed on quality of education&mdash;and Senator Gibson has referred to this in some detail&mdash;particularly the basic skills being inculcated through the education system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Taxation reform was a significant factor and I think that also indicates the incentive that lower tax rates can provide, particularly for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> investment and for the expansion of economic activity within a country. That is certainly a lesson that Australia can learn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lower taxation does not necessarily mean a loss of revenue and reduced government services, because the expanded economic activity that occurs as a result of the incentive of lower taxation, in itself, undergirds the revenue base. Although in individual terms you might have lower tax rates applying, because of the tremendous expansion in economic activity as a result of investment and greater employment being generated, the actual revenue base can be protected, thereby providing the resources for the maintenance of government services. So these are all important lessons that Australia can learn from Ireland. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7410"><TITLE>Australia-Ireland Parliamentary Friendship Group</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not, in the short time available, seek to justify this particular delegation to Ireland, but let me make mention of the fact that I previously went with a delegation to Ireland which was led by Ron Edwards, then Deputy Speaker in the House of Representatives. We presented as gifts to the hosts of the various functions that we attended bottles of Australian wine. On the occasion of this recent visit, the Tanaiste&mdash;the Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;of Ireland made the remark that only very recently had Australia displaced Italy as the source country of the second largest amount of wine going into Ireland. So some things can be done in delegations such as this one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reading the report&mdash;a very brief snapshot of the visit&mdash;people will note that it was a very hectic visit, the first day of which lasted 15 hours, so we were not all the time sampling the products of that country. We made only one recommendation. We could have made many others&mdash;we could have talked 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7411"> about the taxation system and the economic system. We consciously made the decision that it would be better to progress these matters within our own parties, within the different forums each of us, as backbenchers, is involved with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one recommendation, which we all agreed upon, was something that is very dear to my heart, and something which should be dear to the hearts of Australian taxpayers. That is the matter of the expenditure of Australian taxpayers' money in Ireland. Colleagues previously have made mention of the contribution that the International Fund for Ireland is making to the peace process in Ireland. It is heartening to note that that peace process is continuing, and hopefully it will reach a resolution in the near future. I will continue my remarks at a later time.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="7.44 p.m." PAGE="7411"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 7.44 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)&mdash;(4) Details are shown in the following tables. The export approvals cover non&hyphen;military lethal goods such as non&hyphen;military firearms and ammunition, as well as commercial explosives.

A cut&hyphen;off value of $22,000 has been assigned to approvals for 1997/98 which is similar to that of 1996/97. Below this value, the approvals are not significant and mainly consist of non&hyphen;military firearms. Those `awaiting approval' have not been included as each application is considered on a case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case basis and approval should not be assumed.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator Vanstone</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I have received numerous representations, on behalf of several organisations, concerning the transfer of the Bunbury campus of Edith Cowan University to Murdoch University. These have been both for and against the merger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) As higher education institutions are autonomous bodies set up under State legislation, the decision on the future responsibility for the Bunbury campus ultimately rests with the Western Australian Government and the institutions concerned. As you may be aware, discussions are taking place between officials of my Department and the Western Australian Office of Higher Education on the development of a strategic plan for the provision of higher education in the State. The future of the Bunbury campus should be addressed within this context. The Commonwealth's position is that the strategic plan must have the support of all the parties involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Officials of my Department and the Western Australian Office of Higher Education agreed at a June meeting of the Commonwealth and State Joint Planning Committee (JPC) that the Commonwealth would advise Murdoch University of the level of funding that would be available to the Bunbury campus should the transfer proceed. The purpose of this communication was to enable Murdoch University to be in a position to confirm its interest in the transfer so the Commonwealth could then ascertain Edith Cowan University's position on the transfer. My Department initially wrote to the Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of Murdoch University in July to indicate a proposed level of funding and has been clarifying the basis of the funding adjustments associated with any transfer of the campus in response to questions raised by Murdoch University.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The new Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of Edith Cowan University, Professor Millicent Poole, has recently indicated her opposition to the transfer of the Bunbury campus. It is my view that the Commonwealth is not in a position to pursue the transfer of the Bunbury campus to Murdoch University if it does not have the approval of ECU and in the absence of a State strategic plan agreed to by all Universities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Does all imported food have to meet standards set by the Australian Food Standards Code (AFSC).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Is Standard C1 the relevant standard for cooked pig meat and cooked chicken meat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Does this standard provide microbiological specifications for cooked chicken and pig meat; if so, where in the standard are the specifications covering these foods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) With reference to section 3(2) of the Imported food Control Act, which states that food poses a risk to human health if it contains pathogenic micro&hyphen;organisms or their toxins, and given that the Australian New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA) advised a Senate committee in 1996 that this section of the Act enables a standard to be imposed on imported food which may be in addition to that required by the Food Standard Code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Has ANZFA recommended to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection service (AQIS) that standards should be applied to both chicken and pigmeat, in addition to those required by the AFSC, to ensure that any potential for public health problems from pathogenic micro&hyphen;organisms or their toxins is removed; if so, was this recommendation made because of the way these products are manufactured, handled, transported and packaged; if not, can ANZFA identify the information it relied on to satisfy itself that the manufacturing, handling, transportation and packaging of these products will be safe.</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Standard C1 is one of the relevant standards.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) No. If the cooked pig meat and cooked chicken meat are frozen there are relevant microbiological specifications in Standard S2. If they are chilled there are no relevant microbiological specifications in the Food Standards Code. However, all food for sale in Australia must comply with the general provisions of the various Food Acts that require food to be fit for human consumption. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) ANZFA is in the process of finalising its recommendation to AQIS which will require imported cooked pig meat and cooked chicken meat to comply with the relevant specifications in Standard S2 if it is frozen and a similar set of microbiological specifications if it is chilled. The requirements for chilled product are in addition to those required in the Food Standards code and are not applied to domestic product but are considered necessary because the history of the handling, transportation and packaging of these imported products will not be known.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SALARY PACKAGING</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BACKGROUND</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Composition of Packages</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Salary packages are generally made up of:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> cash benefits, including salary and allowances;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> non&hyphen;cash benefits, including items which are subject to salary sacrifice;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> superannuation; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> employment costs, which generally covers FBT, leave loadings, administration costs, superannuation guarantee and the new superannuation tax, but some employers may also include payroll tax and workers compensation. (For executives, some employers have also included the costs of offices and administrative support as a way of encouraging economies in these areas.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employee's Perspective</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the employee's perspective, to see any benefit in salary packaging, the value of the salary package received must be equal to or greater than the equivalent gross salary that would have been received. However, the past advantages of salary packaging have been greatly eroded through the extension of FBT arrangements to cover most items 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7425"> which are salary sacrificed. For most benefits, the amount of FBT included in the package is equal to the top marginal tax rate. Consequently, there is no monetary advantage in most salary sacrifice. People paying less than the top marginal income tax rate would actually be worse off in most circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">One area where there may be a significant advantage is in the provision of a car, as some costs receive a concessional tax treatment. In addition, some other benefits are exempt from FBT. Other benefits may be included in remuneration packages without attracting FBT as they are subject to the otherwise deductible rule. This applies if an employee would have received a once only income tax deduction had the employee been responsible for providing the benefit. Then the employer may reduce the taxable value by that amount. The only advantage to employees is in terms of a stream of income throughout the year rather than a later lump sum tax refund. Benefits included in these categories are at Appendix 1. Even if there is no financial advantage, some employees may prefer to salary sacrifice as this arrangement is more convenient through automatic bill paying through the salary system. This could apply particularly to people working long hours, or who travel frequently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some financial advantage may be gained through the effect of the Medicare Levy and not being liable for other costs, such as the new Superannuation Tax, although the position on whether it is possible to salary sacrifice to specifically avoid this tax is not clear. Our latest advice is that if there are any `loopholes' associated with reducing this tax liability through salary sacrifice, they will soon be closed. If salary is sacrificed it may reduce salary for superannuation purposes. In this case a financial disadvantage may result later in life when pensions come into play.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employer's Perspective</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the employer's perspective the cost of providing a salary package should not exceed the net cost of providing an equivalent gross salary. In the determination of a net cost of providing a fringe benefit to individual staff, the employer must consider the actual cost of the benefit, a range of tax issues, any additional administrative costs including the maintenance of records and FBT returns, and any on&hyphen;costs including superannuation guarantee charge and superannuation surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Administration costs can be substantial, particularly for items such as managing a car fleet and determining the best tax treatment of these (which can vary according to the number of kilometres driven). The Department of Industrial Relations has also noted that these costs need to be taken into account when determining the cost of packages. However, employer's may still wish to offer salary packaging to attract suitable employees. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ISSUES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Range of Benefits Commonly Available</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Appendix 2 provides a brief analysis of items which are generally offered to employees in terms of remuneration packaging. The most common components are employer superannuation contributions, salary sacrifice superannuation contributions, reward payments, cars, professional association membership and self education expenses. The range of major items does not vary significantly from those already provided in the APS to SES Officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may be appropriate not to make any significant changes to current arrangements for the SES given the potential for significant administrative costs and the fact that most other organisations only provide a limited range of benefits to their employees. If other items are included then the administrative costs should probably also be deducted from the package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superannuation</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superannuation could be a problem area in the context of salary sacrificing. This is because the average value of CSS benefits is significantly greater than that of average PSS benefits. The latest DoF advice is that the long term costs, as at 30 June 1996, are 18.9% for CSS and 10.1% for PSS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we adopted the common practice of providing two people in similar positions with packages with the same total employment cost, then a PSS member would receive significantly more salary than a CSS member. Presumably, this would be achieved through increasing the base salary of the PSS member rather than reducing the base salary of the CSS member. However, significantly different salary increases such as this could not be justified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The alternative approach would be to exclude the employer contributions under the CSS and PSS schemes from the salary package. The package would then be $x plus superannuation, rather than $y including superannuation. As you will note from Appendix 2, employer superannuation contributions are not always costed when provided. This approach would be justified on the basis that different superannuation benefits are paid now, and that legislation prohibits people from transferring between schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This approach would also avoid the problem that the figures quoted above are average costs only, and that individuals within the one scheme will receive different benefits depending on their personal circumstances, such as age at entry. The logical extension of an argument to differentiate between schemes is that we should also do so between individuals. We would then need to identify each individual's superannuation benefit, even though this is not possible in a defined benefit scheme. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7426">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The option of not including superannuation in the salary package would not preclude people from sacrificing salary for an additional superannuation benefit.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11 September 1997</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WORKPLACE REFORM in HFS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certified Agreement</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wrote to all staff on 28 July with some broad ideas for a Certified Agreement in HFS as a basis for discussion amongst focus groups. I have now begun to receive feedback from the focus groups and there are already a number of consistent themes emerging about how we manage in the Department and suggestions for doing things better.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of these, and some further work in Corporate Services guided by the Human Resources Management Committee, I believe we can begin now to put some flesh on the bones of a possible Agreement. I am keen for these proposals and options to be tested further by focus groups, and for those not participating in these groups to also have the opportunity to comment. Your feedback will help us to ensure that the draft Agreement, when finalised, responds as fully as possible to the diverse wishes and needs of staff across the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These more specific suggestions and options build on the three themes I identified previously for the Agreement to support our corporate goals:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> skills development;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> performance management; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> attracting and retaining staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SKILLS DEVELOPMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Skills development can be more formally structured into our remuneration and management systems through:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Individual Development Plans for all staff linked to the proposed performance feedback system; and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) advancement within and across classification levels linked to both competence and performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The IDP process will involve consultation between individual staff and their supervisors, within a framework of required and expected skills for the respective classification and team. Progress against agreed plans should be reviewed twice yearly. The framework will take some time to develop, but good work is already underway through the skills audit process and the initiatives in several program areas. A first round of IDPs could be introduced during l997&hyphen;98 accepting that the system should be refined as we learn from experience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some changes to the classification structure are suggested below. These are intended, in part, to facilitate clearer career streaming to support advancement linked more directly to the development of relevant skills and competencies, as well as performance. It is important for us to recognise the different requirements of, for example, technical and professional staff, and to balance general competencies with the subject matter knowledge essential for our credibility and high performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An effective performance management system is critical to overall performance improvement and it is essential that such a system encompass all staff within HFS. Ideally, it should include 360 degree feedback and be closely linked with pay advancement and individual development plans. There should also be close links with our corporate and business planning processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An ideal system would build on those things which motivate us already such as concern for our clients, a strong sense of public service and professional values of excellence and objectivity. It would incorporate monetary and non&hyphen;monetary rewards, and rewards for teams as well as individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My own view is that we do not combine all these elements very well, and there is a reluctance both 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7428"> to recognise and reward top performance and to address seriously poor performance. Some previous experience in performance based pay has caused many staff to be cautious about trying again. Yet, we must, at the very least, review existing arrangements, such as promotion and incremental advancements which are meant to be based on merit and performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specific suggestions and options include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Performance feedback and management</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Performance Feedback</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A performance feedback system for all staff integrated with other HRM functions including remuneration, rewards, inefficiency, probation and discipline; it would also be integrated with Individual Development Plans. The program could be introduced before a new broad banded salary structure is implemented in 1998 by way of initial performance agreements (and IDPs) from the beginning of l998 for those without them at present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Probation</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Probationary arrangements should be linked to the performance management system including the performance feedback program and inefficiency. A further option is the use of probationary promotions, subject to any requirements under the new Public Service Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inefficiency</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Streamline the inefficiency process and integrate with the performance feedback system, relying on internal rather than external review processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New Classification Structure</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Links to performance management and remuneration</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Government Policy Parameters for agreement making require that the new APS structure be implemented in the life of the first certified agreement or by no later than the end of l998. The Department proposes to introduce a new performance based salary progression system from l July l998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Detailed proposals are still being developed, but the core of a new performance&hyphen;based classification structure might include:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> streaming classifications into key career groups for HFS that might be linked to competencies and performance processes; the streams might comprise, for example, a general professional stream (for most policy areas), the different technical/specialist professional streams, an administrative stream and a management stream (an alternative is to fully broadband such streams, possibly along the lines suggested by the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business); 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> replacing `increments' with pay advancement more strictly tied to assessments of performance and competence (an alternative is to introduce for all staff a performance based bonus scheme that does not get built into the base pay);</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> promotion within streams to be based on criteria which give proper recognition to performance and competence, including experience&hyphen;at&hyphen;level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> At this stage, team reward arrangements are based only on the non&hyphen;monetary (or small monetary) awards arrangements. Options could be developed for monetary rewards for teams, but I would caution against any expectation that it would be easy to design an acceptable and fair system for teams, that involves significant monetary rewards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Initial Impact</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Department guarantees that staff would be translated at least at their current dollar salary level and, in addition, on approving an agreement staff would receive a salary increase yet to be determined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RETENTION AND ATTRACTION OF STAFF</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have previously mentioned that our remuneration strategy needs to reflect our labour market reality and the need to assess our relative attractiveness to the skilled people we need to keep and recruit. Market rates assessments assist us in this regard and we have been gathering data on this to help frame the way ahead. Regular market surveys will be undertaken to ensure we have evidence on which to better inform our decision making about our remuneration arrangements. Such information will be made available to staff and their unions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must do a number of other things to be "the employer of choice" such as flexible employment arrangements (eg. work and family policies), effective recruitment systems and individual development planning. Things we should pursue include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Competitive Remuneration and Salary Progression</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recognition and Rewards</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The performance feedback system will not only facilitate good communication and feedback but also provide an effective vehicle to equitably reward staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Salary progression within pay band</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Pay advances (and/or bonuses) will be paid on the basis of attained performance results, measured by both competencies and performance. Pay bands could be widened to improve rewards for good performers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Competitive remuneration</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A balance needs to be drawn in the Agreement between an across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board pay increase, and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7429"> an increase subject to performance results. If there is evidence that changes in pay relativities are required in response to market pressures (eg. for particular technical skills) then that might be achieved through selectively offering higher increases subject to performance results, while keeping a standard across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board increase in pay for all staff. Within the context of competitive remuneration we also have the option of offering salary packaging to all staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Balancing Work and Private Lives</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Leave Packaging</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This system involves combining sick leave on full pay and half pay with special leave (parental carers leave) to make, say, l8 days personal leave per year, which is fully accumulative.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Definitions for leave</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Access to personal leave and bereavement leave might recognise a broader definition of immediate family or household.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Carryover of 48/52 Scheme</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The HSH Agency Bargaining Agreement 1994 introduced a scheme that provided for staff to purchase additional leave of up to 4 weeks per year. Although the take up of this leave by staff has been somewhat limited, feedback from focus groups has indicated that staff still value the scheme. On that basis the intention is to ensure this leave provision carries into the new agreement. It may be possible to supplement this with a provision for half pay recreation leave?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part&hyphen;time Work (PTW)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This initiative aims to streamline the access to PTW for staff and the onerous administrative processes for approving variations to PTW on agreement of all parties. Teams might have authority to grant access to PTW for a team member taking into account operating requirements, budgets, etc. as well as changes in personal circumstances of the team member.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public Holidays</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This initiative allows managers to grant alternative religious/cultural public holidays to their staff, ie. a substitution scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Working Hours and Flextime</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This initiative would broaden the bandwidth to 7.00am to 8.00pm. This means overtime would not be paid between these hours.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Home Based Work</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This initiative aims to provide greater access to home based work&mdash;we aim for a better win&hyphen;win outcome by reviewing the cost structure, assessing the real risks and placing greater onus on staff to meet OH&amp;S and security obligations, and fit out while minimising the costs to the agency. Work teams might have authority regarding home based arrangements for a team member taking into account operating requirements, budgets, etc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HR SIMPLIFICATION AND DEVOLUTION OF RESPONSIBILITY WITH MATCHING ACCOUNTABILITY TO MANAGERS AND TEAMS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Simplification of our human resource management practices can assist greatly in achieving more effective devolution and in freeing up resources. I have outlined below some initiatives we could pursue to simplify the way we manage our people issues, and to give greater responsibility and accountability for people management issues to managers and teams.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Better Management Process:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Discipline and Grievances</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Department will undertake to review these processes in consultation with staff after proclamation of the new Public Service Act with a view to simplified internal processes. The purpose is to avoid unnecessary delay, expense and legalism and to ensure quick, fair and realistic resolution of problems that can otherwise damage all the staff affected directly or indirectly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allowances</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Higher Duties Allowance</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> When a job becomes temporarily vacant the expectation would be that the team share the duties without any additional allowance, subject to such duties being within the training, skill and competence of staff members. Longer periods may require negotiation between the team members and the team leader for some form of recognition for team members undertaking such duties, including payment or other reward.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senior Officer Expense Allowance</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This allowance provides for the amalgamation of the allowance into salary and it would now count as salary for superannuation purposes for SOs. Amalgamation takes away a high administrative workload.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Travelling Allowance and Single Day TA</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This initiative would abolish part day TA for staff travelling by air or rail and develop a reimbursement system for those travelling by road. A review of TA might examine the flexibility of contract accommodation arrangements with payment by the Department directly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7430"> rather than to the individual. We would look to achieve the maximum concessions from our travel contracts, such as group bookings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First Aid, Motor Vehicle, Language, Eyesight Testing, Disability Allowances</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Review these allowances to see how and why they are paid. Single rates of allowance, cessation or change to administration procedures are options.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Excess Travelling Time Allowance</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The intention would be to abolish this provision given the very low use and application within the Department, the complexity and inequity of the allowance, and the unreasonably high administration costs for the allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Restriction (On Call)</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Restriction Allowance is payable to a small number of staff required to remain available for recall to duty outside of normal hours generally in relation to security issues or IT support functions. The allowance has complex rules and a high administrative workload in its current form. Introduction of a standard $2 per hour rate for all restriction could significantly reduce the costs of administering payment of the allowance without impacting greatly on the entitlements of the individual staff in receipt of the allowance. Restriction allowance would be paid for the full period of restriction with no deduction for overtime worked.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Remote Locality Allowances</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This initiative removes access to remote locality provisions for new locally engaged staff. Current staff would continue to receive their allowances for a set period. Alternatively we could adopt an option to cash out remote locality allowances or roll them into one allowance to reduce workload in administering these complex provisions. For new recruits to remote localities it would be open to the Department to negotiate transfer/locality costs through an individual Australian Workplace Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Relocation Allowances</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Rationalisation of allowances and reimbursement arrangements to take up appointment, transfer or promotion within the Department. Give greater discretion to managers to negotiate a package with each staff member.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Loss or damage to clothing</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Removal of access to claims of less than $50 as administrative costs often exceed the cost of the claim.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AGREEMENT FUNDING OPTIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know from the feedback I have received from focus groups that staff are concerned at the prospect of a trade&hyphen;off between jobs and a pay rise. That is, people obviously don't want to lose their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> job or their workmates' job because of a pay rise. I appreciate this concern, but do not see the issue as a one&hyphen;dimensional trade&hyphen;off. We will have to pay for the skills and people we need if we truly aspire to be an organisation that is best practice and achieves the highest levels of performance in the interests of better and more effective delivery of Government programs. If we are to be an employer of choice for existing staff and for staff who we want to attract to HFS, then we have to adjust our remuneration in line with that of our `competitors'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Equally, many staff have already mentioned inefficiencies in our current processes which need to be addressed. It would be quite wrong to continue such processes under a misguided desire to protect employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course we can only work within the resources we have been given by Government and as such we will need to cut our cloth to suit and carefully calculate any pay increase which is part of the certified agreement. But I believe there are a number of options open to us which do not imply an unreasonable jobs/pay tradeoff. These include:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the 1.5% Safety Net Adjustment (SNA) provided in annual supplementation by the Government;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> examining our work practices to more effectively use our operating budgets thus producing savings&mdash;for example, re&hyphen;engineering our work places in Divisions, State and Territory Offices, and Programs;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> trading off costly and inflexible employment arrangements to produce more effective and efficient outcomes whilst at the same time producing savings&mdash;for example, reducing our expenditure on higher duties allowance;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> other savings initiatives to reduce operating costs&mdash;for example, gaining the best price through our travel contract arrangements; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> staging our pay increases and linking them genuinely to performance and competence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What this means is that within a context of continuous improvement we will need to seek the highest level of productivity and to examine our expenditure, structures, processes and procedures. Our aim should be to free up funds for high priority purposes and such savings can be shared directly with staff in the form of pay rises. Simplification of HR processes is one example of finding savings. We will need to further reengineer our business practices and structures to facilitate better and more cost effective outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I encourage all staff to contribute ideas for achieving real savings across their areas of activity. I would like to see in our certified agreement a commitment by all of us in the Department to continually examine our expenditure items and our management processes and structures to see whether there are more efficient and effective ways of going about our business. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7431">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TIMING</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to see a certified agreement concluded before the end of 1997 with a proposed date of implementation being 1 January 1998, such that the benefits including increases to salary can flow to all staff at that time. Pay performance based increases could flow from l July l998.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTRALIAN WORKPLACE AGREEMENTS (AWAs)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government policy provides that certified agreements provide for AWAs. I believe AWAs would be suitable for the SES and Medical Officers and perhaps other categories such as Senior Officers A and B. If the Public Service Act is amended it may be possible to offer some senior staff AWAs on the basis of a trade off of tenure for a "loss of tenure" allowance. I do not propose to use AWAs to place all senior staff on fixed term appointment, and I am very keen for HFS to maintain support for a career&hyphen;based Australian Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONTINUING CONSULTATION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have been undertaking a very detailed consultation process to provide a context for workplace reform in HFS and to better understand the issues which staff see as important. We are also looking at how we can broaden that consultation, for example, staff representatives who would represent 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the staff who do not belong to a union. Your ideas and preferences about how we can more effectively consult with all staff would be welcomed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FEEDBACK</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I welcome your feedback on the proposals put forward. In particular I would like these to be discussed in focus groups and more widely in workgroup discussions, but most importantly I need to know what people are saying. So I would ask that staff or groups of staff give feedback to the team working on the workplace reform issues (see attached).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lastly I appreciate some staff may have concerns with some of the items being proposed. This is an inevitable part of industrial agreement&hyphen;making; moreover, in an organisation as diverse as HFS it is not possible to achieve "all things for all people". I would ask that you carefully consider what we are trying to achieve and how the Agreement might best support the Department in meeting its responsibilities and its vision for the future while providing a competitive level of remuneration and conditions for staff members.</PARA>
