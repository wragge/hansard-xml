<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I take pleasure in introducing the Therapeutic Goods Amendment bill 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments provided for in this bill are necessary to allow for the implementation of an Agreement on Mutual Recognition in Relation to Conformity Assessment Certificates and Markings between Australia and the European Community. The other important change put forward in this bill is an amendment to allow for the recovery of individual batches of registered or listed therapeutic goods included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods which do not conform to standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agreement on Mutual Recognition will allow the Secretary to accept conformity assessment certificates, issued by conformity assessment bodies in the European Union, certifying that registrable medical devices manufactured in the European Community to which the certificates apply meet 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with all Australian regulatory requirements relating to good quality, safety and efficacy, and that listable devices specified in the certificates meet with all requirements as to good quality and safety. Acceptance of these certificates will preclude the need for further evaluation or assessment of the devices before they may be included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and approved for general marketing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to medicines, the bill also provides for acceptance of the results of inspections of overseas manufacturers required to meet Australia's Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, which have been carried out by conformity assessment bodies in the European Union.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other important change to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 will allow the Secretary to require a sponsor to withdraw from the market batches of the sponsor's goods where only a batch or certain batches fail to meet applicable statutory standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision of such a power expands the range of options available to the regulatory authority in such circumstances. At present goods failing to meet applicable standards can be cancelled from the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and, only then, can they be recalled under the act, or the sponsor can be prosecuted for supplying non conforming therapeutic goods. Following this amendment a sponsor who has had no similar transgression in the preceding six months can be required by the Secretary to inform the public and to recall only the batch or batches of therapeutic goods which do not comply. The Secretary must publish notice of such actions in the Gazette. A penalty of 60 penalty units will apply for wilful refusal to comply with such a requirement made by the Secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally a minor correction is made to one section of the act by substituting the word "acceptable" with the words "not unacceptable" to conform with terminology used elsewhere in the act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night, when speaking to amendment No. 1 which stands in my name, I said that a point that had been made in the minority report on the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill that, while we see some merit in separation of purchaser and provider functions, we believe that the provider authority should be precluded from taking on regulatory accrediting or outcome monitoring roles. We argue strongly that these are more properly the responsibility of Commonwealth policy departments or independent authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the government may have some difficulty with the precise wording of the amendment. But, in our view, we have a situation where it is perfectly reasonable for the agency to monitor and report on how it is performing in relation to the service arrangements that it has entered into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would not want to preclude that from occurring, if that is still a concern of the government. No doubt we will hear the comments of the minister on that point. I would be happy to consider any other words the minister may care to suggest, if she still believes that those concerns need to be allayed. I commend amendment No. 1 to the committee. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="2466" TIME="9.37 a.m." SPEAKER="Newman, Sen Jocelyn" NAMEID="BE4" ELECTORATE="TAS" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Social Security; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME><STATE> (Tasmania&mdash;</STATE><ROLE>Minister for Social Security and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP>(9.37 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might help expedite the matter if I were to put the government's position and explain why we are so concerned about this amendment which, in our belief, would make the agency unworkable. A preclusion such as would prevent the agency from undertaking regulatory functions would prevent it also from doing a large part of what it is intended to do. It would operate to deny the agency the power to enter into a service arrangement with the Department of Social Security to carry out some or all of that department's functions under the Social Security Act, because a large part of what the department does now is regulatory by nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By definition, the department, exercising powers under the act, controls access to benefits by the application of the rules. By definition, the act restricts access to those benefits. Those functions would come within the ordinary definition of `regulatory'. It is very hard to imagine how the agency would carry out the department's functions under the Social Security Act without exercising a regulatory function. That is the first part of this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn now to the monitoring function, with which I think perhaps there is also a misunderstanding by those who would seek to amend it in this way. The power to regulate remains with the parliament through the legislative process, policy responsibilities remain with ministers and their policy departments and the agency will deliver services purchased by policy departments and within the framework of the relevant legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his speech on the second reading debate, Senator Faulkner mentioned the aged care area as an example; he said that in that area he had a concern about the potential role of the Service Delivery Agency. That issue was covered in the committee hearings. The Department of Health and Family Services made it very clear. It clarified the agency's role in relation to the accreditation of nursing homes. It said that there is no plan for that at all, and:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2467">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accreditation mechanisms, which the minister is currently reviewing as part of the structural review package, would be part of aged care legislation. Indeed, an exposure draft is now available, which details what we expect will be covered in the aged care act. We will be contracting or purchasing from the Commonwealth Service Delivery Agency the income testing of residents of nursing homes for means testing purposes. The agency will be undertaking a specified function for us that will be given authority in the aged care statute.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So there is no plan for accreditation. But, if accreditation were to be desired in the future from the agency&mdash;and I say `if'&mdash;it would have to be as part of a policy of the Department of Health and Family Services, it would have to come by way of legislation to this parliament and it would have to then come by way of contract between the Department of Health and Family Services and the agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliament will have a complete opportunity to control that process down the track. It is not the plan. It is not being provided for now. It is not intended. But I would say to those, particularly in the opposition, who have been so concerned about the thought of public sector jobs disappearing: if these roles are not given to the agency&mdash;and that means future opportunities for accreditation perhaps; it certainly means the monitoring arrangements&mdash;what is the parliament expecting of the government? Is it expecting that therefore the agency will have to go to the private sector for accreditation purposes, or to the private sector for monitoring purposes? Currently we are not proposing accreditation at all. That is one thing that is off the agenda for now, and it would have to come by way of approval of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the monitoring exercise is an essential element for making sure that the agency itself knows how it is delivering its services. It is customer focused. It has to know at any given time how well or badly it is doing. To force the agency to go out to the private sector to implement a monitoring process would seem unnecessarily restrictive. It may be sometimes desirable, and certainly external independent monitoring is useful from time to time. But, surely to goodness, the public sector employees in the agency should be able to monitor also the performance of the agency.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the committee's attention to the fact that currently, with these programs being administered by the Department of Social Security, quality assurance is an essential element of making sure that we do provide the service to the best our ability. Quality assurance obviously has to continue under the agency. It is an important element of monitoring, surely. I think it would be a terrible shame for this amendment, which would preclude the agency from independently monitoring the services it delivers, to go through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Really, it is a nonsense. I believe that it flies in the face of all accepted accountability practices in public administration. I ask Senator Faulkner whether the opposition is seriously suggesting that the agency should not be able to seek an independent view on its delivery of a particular service&mdash;for example, by engaging a consultant to review its systems design or its business process design.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agency has to have a capacity to fully monitor and track its performance through both internal and external sources of advice and assistance, so as to ensure accountability to the minister and the parliament, and so we may all be confident that it is fulfilling the charter of service to the public that has been established. None of this takes away from the independent advice which will also be available to ministers and the parliament through audits by the Australian National Audit Office and by evaluations, undertaken by the purchaser departments, of their contract of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the Senate not to go down this path which in fact would neuter the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency in the exercise of its role, which is one that is currently properly exercised by the Department of Social Security under legislative authority. That would be the case with the agency taking on the role. It is under legislative authority. It needs to be scrutinised internally and it will also be scrutinised externally. Any limitation along the lines of these amendments would go to neuter the effectiveness of agency altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I go back to the question of limiting the regulatory role. Just about everything 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2468"> the department currently does in the exercise of its powers under the Social Security Act has a regulatory connotation. To remove that power from the new agency would be the ultimate neutering.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sometimes in this place we say we will listen to the debate and make up our minds and we really do not mean that. That is exactly what I am doing at the moment, because I am caught between two opinions. What the ALP is trying to do through these amendments is very commendable and that is to ensure there is some distance between the monitoring of the department and the  department itself. That is always desirable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a briefing from the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) and I have listened to her. It seems to me that there are two things happening, both of which are desirable and they are not coming together. I will ask Senator Faulkner to give a bit more explanation, but for example I refer to his illustration that you would not want the same people in the department and on the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. That is a helpful analogy, but the Social Security Appeals Tribunal is actually an appeals process and you certainly would want to keep the appeals process separate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is saying that the problem with the ALP amendment is that it actually interferes with the normal operation and running of the department. I do not think the ALP wants to do that either. You can see my problem in trying to decide where it is. I wonder whether independently monitoring that service is also a problem. Surely what we do want is independent monitoring of the service. If I could get a bit of clarification on those issues that would help me.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the points that Senator Woodley makes. This largely swings on the Minister for Social Security's (Senator Newman) interpretation of the word `regulate'. I would be interested if the minister could assist the committee by giving us a definition of `regulation' or what the legal definition of `regulation' is that she is using. I suspect that

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Faulkner may have been consulting his advisers at the time, but I did go through the dictionary definition of `regulatory' and drew on that when I was advising the committee before about the department's functions under the act. I said that a large part of what the department does is regulatory by nature. By definition the department controls the access to benefits by the application of rules.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to say that we all have an understanding of what `regulation' might be, but I do not think that a dictionary definition of `regulation' answers the question that Senator Woodley asks. Let me put it in very clear form. I asked two questions: what is the legal definition of `regulation'&mdash;and I think that will assist Senator Woodley&mdash;and how does the agency independently monitor itself? As I understand what Senator Woodley puts to the committee, that is the nub of issue before us. We would probably all agree that this is where we are at in relation to what hopefully will be a very contained debate on this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pose those two questions to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman): give me a legal definition of `regulate' or `regulation'; and explain to the committee how the agency can independently monitor itself. If we have the government's view put on these issues, we can perhaps determine the issue and move to the next amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is the role of the purchaser departments, the Auditor-General, the Department of Finance and the parliament to independently monitor the agency. We cannot walk away from the fact that those serviced agreements are what determines what is to be achieved by the agency. We have independent monitoring now and, as I said at the beginning of the debate on this amendment, provision is made for it. I cannot give you today a legal definition of `regulatory', but Senator Faulkner has been minister for veterans' affairs and at the very least he would understand the regulatory role that the Department of Veterans' Affairs played in implementing&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not really understand your concerns and, therefore, it is very hard to address them. I have taken you through some of the examples of what the department now does which are regulatory by nature. The department in the future will be a policy department which contracts for services to be provided by the agency.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, I thought your immediate past contribution struck upon the nub of the problem. The amendment is saying that the agency should not be a self&hyphen;regulatory body. That is what the amendment is prohibiting. If you are saying that that is the appropriate course, then I do not fully understand the nature of your objection to the amendment. What the amendment is preventing is the agency independently monitoring itself. That is not to say that the agency would not audit its own delivery of  services. I think self&hyphen;audit is different from a monitoring or a regulatory role.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is not just a question of auditing whether the money is being paid out correctly, although it is also important to monitor that both internally and externally. But the quality of the service must be independently monitored and internally monitored. Once again, the failure to grasp the idea of the contract is the base of the problem with this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contract has to set up the performance outcomes that are required. Both parties to that contract need to know that those outcomes are being achieved or where they are falling short. The purchaser&mdash;which is the department&mdash;has to know that, and so does the provider, which is in trouble if it does not achieve the outcomes that the contract demands. They need to have internal quality assurance. They also need to be assured that their own internal evaluations are spot on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently the department is exercising the dual role that will in the future be provided by the purchaser and the provider.

If that were to happen in the future, it would have to come to the parliament to be achieved, because it would be a change in the role of what is currently done by the Department of Health and Family Services. It would then be a contract between that department with the

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have publicly answered this in the past, but that may not have been in the Senate. The decision was taken very deliberately to make this agency a statutory authority, because we believe these are services which need to always be provided by the public sector. We believe that the evaluation and monitoring processes can also be provided by the public sector. Equally, they could be, as they are now, contracted out to consultants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this amendment goes through, we will be prohibited from having independent monitoring. In fact, we will have real trouble in monitoring it altogether. I would suggest that we need to give the opportunity to the public sector&mdash;which is what the government is doing&mdash;to do that evaluation process.

This amendment would require any ministerial notifications of the `general policies of the Commonwealth government that are to apply in relation to the agency, the board or the employees' to be published in the agency's annual report. To try and save time, let me also perhaps try and pre-empt the argument of the government here.

I would be very pleased to listen to what you have to say in relation to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, of course, you will not agree that any notifications that you give the board should be published in the annual report of the agency. I do not understand the problem in relation to this. If your general policies are well-known policies on the public record,

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me try and take a topical example, seeing we are using analogy and examples as debating mechanisms in this particular committee stage. Everyone knows that you could have implemented an entirely voluntary so-called work for the dole program without any amendment to the social security legislation. What your legislation does, as I read it, is give you the power to compel people to participate in that scheme and it allows the government to provide a payment to those people to cover their work related expenses. But it is not essential in implementing a work for the dole scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course the work for the dole policy, you would argue, is a well-known policy of your government. We do not say it is a good policy. We do not believe it is. We would not have done it. But, under the terms of this legislation, there would be nothing to prevent you from implementing a non-compulsory, non-supplement version of this scheme by simply notifying the agency of your policy. You would not be subject to any scrutiny. You would not even have to publish your notification in the annual report, as the legislation now stands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What if, in the next budget, for example, you announce that it is your general policy that all authorities within your jurisdiction produce running cost savings of 50 per cent next year? Could you notify the agency? Would the board have any recourse but to ensure the savings were generated? What constraints actually exist on your use of the notification power?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has adverted to precedents which I could quote. Let me quickly quote them, because they are all examples where 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> similar provisions are in legislation of the previous government. They are: the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989, section 48; the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, section 161; the Employment Services Act 1994, section 72, which is an identical provision; and the Telecommunications Act 1991, section 49. All of those acts were passed when the current opposition was in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are doing nothing untoward in this legislation. The general policies of this government will be well known and will not require the kind of publication and, with it, the public and parliamentary scrutiny that notification in the annual report of the agency would bring. It is only general policies we are talking about being notified under this provision. There is different provision in the bill for specific directions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also draw it to your attention that there is a precedent. Only last year, on 18 August, in Aboriginal Legal Service Ltd v. Herron, the Full Federal Court ruled that the capacity to give general directions under subsection 12(1) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 1989 did not allow the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to give certain directions to ATSIC. One of the relevant directions was that ATSIC was not to make a grant or loan of money to a body unless certain conditions were met. One of the reasons for finding the directions invalid&mdash;this is the nub of the matter&mdash;was that they required a particular outcome and therefore could not be described as a general direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the specifics that Senator Faulkner just referred to, the question of running costs changes, for example, that is a matter which first of all has to be made clear to the parliament by way of appropriations. It would be negotiated and taken account of in the contract between the purchaser and the provider. It would be subject to the estimates committee scrutiny, as currently such matters are, when the department appears before the estimates committee. So there is no reason for having a concern about the running costs issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to the work for the dole scheme, as Senator Faulkner said, there would 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2474"> be no requirement to change the legislation if it was purely voluntary. That is the situation now with the department. If the department was to implement a voluntary work for the dole scheme, there would be no need for it to come before the parliament. It is because there is a wish to have some pilots, where there is compulsory work for the dole, that there is a need to come back to the parliament. The same would apply if the department was to produce a requirement that the agency provide a compulsory work for the dole scheme. Once again, it could not happen without a change to the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policy department is the department that is responsible for the legislation. It is the legislation that drives the contractual arrangements between the department and the agency. The scrutiny is very clear. In this amendment we are only talking about general policies being notified under the provision for the annual report of the agency. We believe that it is totally unnecessary, because the sorts of policies that are being described are ones which are well known and on the public record.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, I am trying to the listen to the debate. I am inclined to support this amendment. I must say that one thing that does worry me is the departmental assertion that it would be a bad thing if the policies in question are well known and do not require publication and, with it, public and parliamentary scrutiny. I would have thought that it is very desirable. This amendment is important because it gives us a device or a lever to look at these particular policies. I think that that kind of scrutiny is very helpful and very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another issue in the illustration about voluntary work for the dole. There was legislative change&mdash;we passed some legislation just before Christmas. The illustration does not hold up because we did just that: we passed legislation before Christmas to make it possible for people on the dole to work in approved voluntary organisations; thereby they do not have to fulfil the activity test by going out and seeking work.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This particular amendment is an important one relating to omitting the provision allowing the CEO to employ staff outside the provisions of the Public Service Act. On this occasion I would like to very briefly read an extract from the minority report on this issue to put this issue in context. The minority report said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2476">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides the Agency with the capacity to employ staff outside the provisions of the current Public Service Act, on terms and conditions determined by the Chief Executive Officer. As the CPSU noted in evidence, `we could have people within the Agency under different categories of employment performing the same levels of work for different pay and condition outcomes'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While we recognise the precedents for employing staff outside the provisions of the Act under legislation establishing other Commonwealth authorities, we are concerned that such precedents have yet to be tested in the context of new industrial relations arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not persuaded by the Department's argument that the present Public Service Act hampers their capacity to employ temporary staff to deal with peak workloads. We note also that this and other significant issues will be dealt with in the context of the government's foreshadowed changes to public service terms and conditions. In the meantime, and given the Department's stated intention to negotiate a single enterprise agreement with Agency staff which could deal with arrangements for peak workload staffing, we see the provision as unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are at least two tools available to the agency to deal with emerging or temporary staffing problems. Revising the enterprise agreement negotiated with the staff of the agency and in the longer term the government's announced reforms to the Public Service Act. What I say is: use these. There is no need to employ staff outside the Public Service Act, no need at all. The agency can do the things it needs to do within the confines of the Public Service Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we ought not lose sight of the fact that even in a very limited debate like this the point needs to be made that the agency is delivering a public service. Labor cannot allow you to erode the pay and conditions of public servants by what I consider to be a backdoor mechanism.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does not accept the amendment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may appear that this flexibility is possible under current arrangements by the employment of people under contract. The inclusion of subclause 35(3) was intended to make this capacity both express and transparent on the face of the legislation. The current arrangements are, in any case, unsatisfactory in that temporary employees engaged under the Public Service Act attain statutory rights to permanency after a period of temporary employment and that is not conducive to flexibility of deployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the clause is unexceptional when compared with similar provisions in other Commonwealth legislation setting up statutory bodies. I draw the committee's attention to the fact that the Department of Social Security, in its evidence to the legislative committee, pointed out that similar provisions are found in the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989, section 120; the Industry Commission Act 1989, section 43; the Hearing Services Act 1991, sections 49 and 50; the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission Act 1985, section 54; and the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, section 35.</PARA>

I think we had agreed that, if there were to be a recommittal, it would be a sensible use of time to have it back to back with some other division. As it turned out, there were no further divisions so that sensible suggestion did not come into play.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My understanding, however, differed from Senator Faulkner's in that I was pretty clear that Senator Harradine was foreshadowing that he would seek leave for there to be a recommittal. I imagine he would have had to have done that at the time after the division. I suspect it is a subtle difference of recollections. Ultimately, it is up to Senator Harradine whether he wanted to seek leave, but I thought he was foreshadowing that he might seek leave. He has decided that he will not be.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2479"> I would certainly like to see the vote determined that way. I am a very gracious person, but I have draw the attention of the committee and Senator Harradine to some remarks he and Senator Alston made in this place a few days ago&mdash;in fact, last Thursday&mdash;when through misadventure I had to seek a recommittal of a vote then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept Senator Harradine was out of the chamber and, for reasons beyond his control, was not able to cast his vote earlier. I am so sorry he did not so readily accept the situation when the roles were reversed. It is remarkable how these things can come back to catch us. Here we have Senator Harradine in the invidious situation I found myself in last Thursday. I am very happy&mdash;although he was not very happy last Thursday&mdash;to accept that this makes a difference to the vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have got here is the extraordinary situation that, with the effluxion of just a few minutes, it appears that Senator Harradine is changing his vote. That is going to make a material difference to the outcome. I think we should have that clarified through having the vote again on the amendment that the Labor Party has brought forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would appear that, had the vote been taken at the time, as was the previous practice, Labor's amendment would get up with the vote of Senator Harradine. With the new practice of having the recommittal put at the end of the committee stage, Senator Harradine has changed his mind and Labor's amendment is not going to get up. I presume that he has changed his mind through some new information that has come to his notice.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bill amends the Air Navigation Act 1920, the Airports Act 1996 and corrects a typographical error in the Airports (Transitional) Act 1996. Fundamentally, the purpose of the legislation is to provide a new set of arrangements under which charter flights may operate and enable 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2480"> regulations to be made to establish a register of unencumbered aircraft operated by Airservices Australia. The reason I highlight these two examples is that the opposition thinks these are sensible provisions. We will be supporting the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On what is going to be a long day, in order to save the time of the Senate by not unnecessarily going over the magnificent record that we had on aviation policy and the appalling record that the government has on aviation policy, I will let all that go through to the keeper, on today's occasion, anyway, and indicate that we will be moving a number of amendments to the legislation, as I understand it, and I know that amendments will also be moved by the Greens and the Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the advice of the Senate, we will not be supporting on this occasion the Greens' or Democrats' amendments. There are a number of amendments relating to airport noise that I think the Greens will be moving, parts of which were supported by us during the committee stages in a previous debate but which will not be supported on this occasion. The simple reason is that, as a result of the sales process now being well advanced, we do not think it is reasonable or proper at this stage to start changing the rules. The question of noise is a major one in terms of potential purchases and we do not think it is reasonable or proper, at this point in time, having had that matter determined at an earlier time, to attempt to change it again. The bottom line is that we will be supporting this legislation. I understand that the government has agreed to support our amendments but we will not be supporting the amendments to be moved by the Greens and the Democrats.</PARA></SPEECH>

In real terms, the reason the amendment is here is that I think ministers of both sides of the house would in the normal course of these approvals take that into account, but it explicitly puts in the legislation that it is not simply the commercial bottom line that has to be taken into account; some regard has to be given to the interests of the Australian aviation industry as well, and that is then explicitly set out in the obligations that the  minister has.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997, I had actually intended to speak briefly on the second reading. The reason I had intended to speak was that there are some changes in the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill which are welcome and which I am pleased to see we are moving towards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are, however, some amendments which the Greens WA will be putting and they have not yet been circulated. This bill was going to be brought on yesterday and we asked that it be at least put off a little while so that we had a chance to deal with it better. I will be putting our amendments as soon as they are circulated, but everybody knows the work load that has been on us in the last while. Of course, in a situation where there are just one or two senators, you find that it becomes almost impossible to deal with these important bills reasonably in such a short time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's amendments Nos 1 and 2 I believe hold some merit, but I am wondering whether Senator Collins could give us some more explanation of the reason why he is moving them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite simply and briefly, the amendments require the secretary to give consideration to employment, investment and development in the Australian aviation industry when granting to a foreign operator permission for charters. As I said, that is quite simply the effect of the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, I think it is something that in practice ministers of all political persuasions would have done, but I think an important strengthening of the legislation would be that there is actually a legislative requirement to do so. In other words, it is not simply the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> commercial bottom line, as I said before, but there is a positive obligation to take the interests of the Australian aviation industry into account when these things are being done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The subsequent amendments require the secretary, when granting an exemption to a class of charter flights from gaining permission, to give the same consideration to the same matters that must be considered when granting an individual charter. They are, I think, positive amendments that would be warmly welcomed by the Australian aviation industry. I urge the Senate to support them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That would back up the Greens' propensity to support the amendments. It also perhaps leads us to the inevitable conclusion that the amendments by themselves will not be any substitution for industry policy, whether it is aviation industry policy or transport policy in general. In the end this government has to come clean with what its industry policy is, whether or not it actually has a policy in relation to promoting employment, good industry and ecologically sustainable industry development in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point that Senator Margetts correctly makes is that of how the chair should be addressed. Frankly, I found the directive of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. I appreciate that, Mr Chairman. I want to return to our two amendments, and I will address them as quickly as I can. The amendments to the bill put forward by us support the bill's proposal to insert important new offences into the legislation that deal with the deliberate causing of harm to the environment and an airport site&mdash;that is, if the acts are carried out intentionally or recklessly. The new offences are an integral part of the Commonwealth regime to protect the environment on leased Commonwealth airports and employ a tiered approach with escalating penalties for more serious damage to the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Provision is made for persons charged with more serious offences to be found guilty of a lesser charge where there is insufficient evidence to convict them of the more serious charge. That is the reason that the Australian Democrats, the Greens and the opposition like this bill: because it introduces some attractive components into regulation. But there are weaknesses. They include the apparent non-promulgation of important regulations under the Airports Act 1996 upon which these new amendments depend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main issue from an environmental point of view that keeps coming up is the need for airports to have a legally binding environ 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mental management plan and penalties for environmental harm which address both pollution and site disturbance, such as in my own state the destruction of remnant bushland and wetland as proposed at Perth airport. Many airports are considering expansions of runways or shopping commercial facilities that will impact on remnant bushland&mdash;and, incidentally, will also impact on the interests of local traders and small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Second, and related, the other important amendment I think we need to propose is the formal designation under this legislation of the Minister for the Environment as the action minister in determining matters which need to be reviewed under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. As things stand, it is the minister for transport and this is not satisfactory. I am disappointed that Senator Collins is going to vote against this. Hopefully if he listens to this he will change his mind on at least one of these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Airports Act 1996 each airport is to have a final environment strategy. This is a draft environment strategy which has been approved by the minister under section 115. The environment strategy will run for five years under section 117. An airport lessee has 12 months to prepare the environment strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environmental standards for airports are set out in the regulations, and the act just says that regulations will come through. Section 136 of the Airports Act 1996 says that both state and Commonwealth laws can apply, unless inconsistent then the Commonwealth law prevails, and that the regulations can declare that a particular state law will not apply. This is much the same as the exemption given to telecommunications carriers to exempt them from the operation of state environmental laws in relation to cable roll-out and towers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The three tiered environment protection offences at item 61 in the bill are reasonably good, subject to knowing just what the regulations will require to be inserted in the airport environment strategy. I note the inclusion at item 66 of standards proposed or approved by the Standards Association of Australia. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2484"> explanatory memorandum says precious little about what this means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fairly profound matter that we wished to examine was whether legislation should place decision-making in relation to environmental matters at airports with the minister responsible for the environment rather than with the minister for transport. Under current Commonwealth law, environmental impact statements are invoked only if the matter is considered significant and if the minister responsible for the particular portfolio refers the issue to the Minister for the Environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendment No. 2 seeks to place responsibility for improving environment strategies with the Minister for the Environment and not with the minister for transport. We think that is entirely appropriate. But, with regard to amendment 1&mdash;and this is the amendment I expect you to support, Senator Collins&mdash;the Airports Act 1996 also has a part 5, `Land use, planning and building controls,' which requires ministerial approvals. I think it would be eroding the role of the minister for transport if this authority were also moved to the Minister for the Environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendment inserts in section 80 `Consultations' a requirement for the airport lessee to also consult with the Commonwealth minister responsible for administering the environment. Consultation is also required of state and territory governments and local government; so why not the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment as well? That is all amendment 1 does; it requires consultation. I would like Senator Collins to indicate whether he will still be opposing both our amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason we will not be supporting the amendments is not that the opposition does not share the concern that the Australian Democrats and the Greens have with the proper environmental control at airports; we do. The major reason we will not be supporting these amendments is that, from my own experience as the former minister for aviation, the airports we are dealing with are Commonwealth places. Because they are Commonwealth places, they are automatically under the control, in respect of environmental

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There would be no necessity to make these kinds of changes to the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) if what Senator Bob Collins said was working properly. We received a great many assurances during the debate on the airports privatisation bill that the greatest care would be taken, but in fact the Federal Airports Corporation challenged heritage listing and, despite what the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) said at the time, that listing was lost. We are still hoping, in the case of Perth airport, that the very important wooded wetlands can be relisted. So, in relation to the difficulties that are occurring with the fact that airports&mdash;not by accident&mdash;have ended up sometimes having some of the most important areas of remnant bushlands left in otherwise fairly developed areas, it is extremely important that they are handled well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst it might be Commonwealth land, it might be no surprise to Senator Collins to know that that does not automatically mean there is going to be action if there are moves to affect the environment on Commonwealth land. That is the reality. That is what has happened already in relation to Perth airport. It is good to see that there are changes in the legislation, but I think there are many people who feel that these amendments would go some way towards creating a better situation where there is an automatic consultation. I do not think that is the case at the moment and I do not think the action minister at the moment is necessarily the environment minister.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will not be supporting these amendments. Senator Collins has already explained the reason why the opposition is not supporting them, and the government's view is very similar to that. Ultimately the minister for aviation must have responsibility for the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1). These amendments divide the responsibility. I am informed that under the EPIP Act there is already requirements to consult. But the reality of the situation is that, if you want the minister for aviation to be responsible to the parliament and to the people for his decisions under his legislation, you do not divide the responsibility in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts raised a side issue entirely unrelated to this bill. She raised issues relating to Perth airport and to the AHC's listing and then agreement to consent orders to delist in an action before, I think, the Federal Court. These amendments would make absolutely no difference to that arrangement. The AHC and the FAC were having a dispute. I was asked to deal with that dispute when I was the

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) had a practical view that it is a bit silly to have two Commonwealth agencies&mdash;the Federal Airports Corporation and the Australian Heritage Commission&mdash;spending hundreds of thousands of dollars fighting each other in court when most Australians would think that the FAC, if it has hundreds of thousands of dollars, should spend it on looking after airports and that the Australian Heritage Commission, if it has hundreds of thousands of dollars, should spend it on looking after heritage as opposed to looking after lawyers. The FAC and the Australian Heritage Commission, I think as a result of consultations, discussions and negotiations that I facilitated, will be making sure that there is a sensible regime under this act, as amended by the bill today, to ensure the protection of heritage at Perth airport and other airports around Australia.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">At the outset, I congratulate the government on this bill. I believe that in this case it has made legitimate attempts to address some real problems, as befits a social regulator acting in the interests of the land and people of Australia. In particular, I am pleased that it has introduced a number of measures that address deficiencies&mdash;deficiencies in the regime of environmental protection which was established&mdash;that we argued in the original bill. These deficiencies existed even after the passage of a number of amendments in the Senate strengthening the environmental protection regime. This was particularly so with the inclusion of a broader range of issues in the development of master plans and requirements to propose actions to prevent environmental or heritage damage within those plans which must be complied with and where non-compliance is an offence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Campbell would know, I am usually the one to hand out brickbats, but it is a small bouquet we are throwing on this occasion. However, among the primary deficiencies of the original legislation was the lack of penalties and strong requirements for compliance in the environmental strategy. Particularly offensive was section 132, which states that a failure to take `all reasonable steps to ensure the strategy was complied with' cannot be considered an offence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Chairman, note that the requirement of failure to make even such a reasonable attempt was not allowed to be treated as an offence. The bill addresses some of this with the introduction of various environmentally related offences, complete with penalties, as 131B, 131C and 131D. What I am not certain about is how this is consistent with the retention of an essentially unmodified section 132. It seems strange to state that failure to even make a reasonable attempt at compliance with the strategy is not an offence, and then to state that various things which must be contraventions of the strategy are offences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my amendments seeks to address this, stating that failure to at least make reasonable attempts to comply with the environment strategy which the lessee itself 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2487"> designed is an offence with a penalty. It also eliminates any lack of clarity that may arise between 132, which states unequivocally that non-compliance is not an offence, and modified 131, which states that many activities that must constitute failure to comply are offences. In order to clarify this, I commend amendments 3 and 4 to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just quickly; the coalition, as indicated, will not be supporting these amendments. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, we believe basically that for someone to say that if you have not abided by your plan it becomes an offence is an inappropriate way of ensuring that people stick by their plans. We believe that under section 15 there are already powers of injunction for failure to perform against an environment strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we believe that this is a more appropriate way to deal with non-performance. Finally, in relation to amendment number No. 4 moved by Senator Margetts, the government's policy on the advice of the Attorney-General's Department, which I think is good advice, is that matters relating to penalty units should be consistent across Commonwealth legislation. This would create inconsistency, which we would regard as unnecessary and undesirable.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I also wish to address the penalties themselves in this amendment. I accept that we are unlikely to get support for a maximum penalty for serious environmental harm which is greater than $500,000. I do not like it. By its nature the damage involved in this kind of breach is exceedingly severe, and by definition it must be high impact and irreversible or causing substantial harm to public health, not only the health of one or two people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about major disaster here. The term `irreversible environmental damage of high impact' is probably a reasonably contentious term legally and likely to be somewhat difficult to prove. It is possible that a company operating in an airport in such a way that it causes irreversible environmental damage of high impact may decide that half a million dollars is a justified expense, particularly where that expense may be reduced through arguing that impact is only significant, or that there is some potential to reverse the damage, within some time frame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, we are happy to see that explicit recognition as an offence with penalties. However, given that a case of damage 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2488"> may result in convincing the court that what may be high impact is unequivocally significant impact, I can see plea bargaining reducing very serious environmental damage to a charge of material environmental harm. The maximum penalty then becomes $200,000, which is actually less than the current maximum penalty of $250,000 for violation of environmental regulations under section 132. This seems somewhat counterproductive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would therefore seek to increase the maximum penalty for material environmental harm to 250 penalty units. It should be noted that this is a maximum and there is discretion for a lower penalty to be applied. I would therefore seek support for my amendment No. 5.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">We will be seeking to oppose the changes to section 132. That section establishes that it is an offence to violate Commonwealth environmental regulations. It is not the same as non-compliance with environmental strategy nor it is the same as creating environmental damage. Regulations are effectively laws which override state and territory environmental laws, and regulation and penalties for violation of regulations are appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government seeks to tie penalties for violations of regulation to actual environmental damage, setting the maximum penalty as equivalent to the maximum penalty for such damage. This is equivalent to saying that running a red light should only attract a fine if an accident results. I always remember reading an old law from the United Kingdom about ferry operators overloading; one of the penalties was transportation to Australia&mdash;heaven forbid!&mdash;and it said `if anybody drowned'. Perhaps this is one of those `if anybody drowns' penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This equivalent saying that running a red light should only attract a fine if an accident results and that the seriousness of the accident should determine the fine is nonsense. Violation of environmental regulations which would replace and override state and territory environmental laws is a serious thing even if no damage occurs. I note that the penalty prescribed&mdash;250 units&mdash;is, once again, a maximum penalty. Penalties may be prescribed under regulations themselves, and this should be respected. It is improper to tie such 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2489"> penalties to the impact of the violation. Therefore, we oppose clauses 62 and 63 of the bill.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This goes back to states and territory rights. Section 136(2) states that Commonwealth regulations extinguish state and territory laws and regulations in relation to airports. This clause seeks to do the same thing for the new Commonwealth offences relating to environmental impact as contained in 131B, 131C and 131D.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This may be dangerous since state and territory laws relating to impacts are often much more specific. Terms are often better defined and penalties may be much higher depending on the level of damage. I realise that Commonwealth legislation overrides laws in which there is a conflict, but I opposed 136(2) when it was proposed. I suggested an alternative which would have the Commonwealth law establish a minimum respecting any more exacting amendments by state and territories. This amendment is in line with my earlier opposition, although I think there is even more cause in relation to general laws and environmental and health impacts.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it the Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997 and the Export Market Development Grants (Repeal and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997. The government has delivered its second reading speech on this legislation. On behalf of the opposition, it is for me to present our views on this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Export market development grants are an institution in Australia that serve our national interest. It serves our national interest in a powerful way. It does so by providing uncapped grants to would-be Australian exporters, encouraging them to venture into the marketplace beyond our shores and win export contracts for their companies, which will build the export base for this nation and turn around what is, by any measure, a quite severe current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth about Australia is that in dollar values we sell less to the world than we buy 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2490"> from the world. We are a nation whose profile is, in the main, that of exporting bulk commodities&mdash;be it agricultural goods or mineral commodities&mdash;and we are an importing nation whose profile is, in the main, that of importing sophisticated manufactured goods. As a country we cannot go on selling cheap, unimproved bulk commodities at the lowest value in the marketplace and buying back sophisticated manufactured goods that command the highest price in the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Labor was in office, our major thrust was to turn around the profile of our exports by encouraging the manufacturing sector and the services sector to export their goods and services. To do so, a range of incentives was provided. That range of incentives includes export market development grants. Those grants serve the needs mostly of small to medium sized companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government purports to be a government for small businesses. This bill cuts out essential support that small businesses need to trade in the international marketplace. It cuts them out or cuts them down. As a consequence, this bill is regressive legislation. It is legislation against our national interest. It is legislation against our need to export more at the improved level of the chain rather than at the unimproved level of the chain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's current account deficit is roughly in the order of $20 billion. That is a big figure, but it is meaningless unless you contrast it with what percentage of GDP that represents. Our current account deficit is about four per cent of GDP. It is high by world standards, and the only way we will turn it around is to export more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget this government brought down last year&mdash;the first conservative budget in Australia for 13 years&mdash;is a budget which forecasts, in fact, for 1996-97 and 1997-98 a contraction in the amount of contribution that net exports will make to GDP. It is a contraction of 0.25 per cent. That is to be contrasted with the increase that the net contribution exports made to Australia's GDP under Labor. In our last year, 1995-96, we had a plus one per cent contribution&mdash;a positive outcome for this country. In one year, the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government has turned that into a negative contribution to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Encouraging exports means nurturing an export culture for Australia. The instrument to do that is the Australian Trade Commission&mdash;Austrade. Austrade has had its budget cut. ITES&mdash;a scheme for bigger exporters, a rollover scheme and a scheme that played a significant role in lifting Australia's international exports&mdash;has been abolished. Now we have the EMDG Bill, which is to further remove supports for the export industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As with industry policy&mdash;where this new government has decided that the harshest, most severe version of rational economics is to apply&mdash;this government has reduced these incentives. In industry policy across the board, the government has reduced incentives on a range of areas which expose our companies to predatory international competition with no protection or very little protection. I believe that is a vote of no confidence in Australia's capability to succeed in developing, particularly in the manufacturing and service industries. Certainly that is what the industries say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of EMDG, we have had a Senate committee of inquiry into this bill. A number of well-known national bodies that represent exporters gave evidence. These are bodies whose main role in life is to represent the interests of the companies covered by them. These are bodies which, by their very nature, are conservative when it comes to criticising governments. Their preferred position is to work with governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of them were critical of this bill. The Australian Institute of Export, representing most exporters in Australia&mdash;certainly all of the small companies that are exporters&mdash;was a severe critic of this bill. The Australian Information Industries Association, which represents the field of information technology and telecommunications&mdash;the biggest and fastest growing industry in the world: the one that commands the most excitement and drama, the one in which Australia has a leading role, particularly as a software creator&mdash;is concerned that this bill will limit the opportunities of its members to realise in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2491"> international market by removing essential supports from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said on previous occasions, currently we are in deficit on information industry exports. We import $6 billion worth of information industry technology a year. By the year 2000, we will be importing, on current estimates, $20 billion worth of computers and of convergence and telecommunications materials&mdash;$20 million, which is about the size of our current account deficit now. What is urgent for this nation is to encourage our exporters in this area so that they can sell to the world more than we buy from the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are like Geoffrey Rush. They are Oscar winners in their field, but we are removing from them the ability to star in films and get world and global recognition by cutting out these props. That is a black mark against the government. It is not me saying that; they are saying that. An independent refereeing of the statistics of this scheme reveals that&mdash;loud and clear and more eloquently than anyone else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me continue the rollcall. The Australian Publishers Association, which represent book publishers in Australia, are a relatively small industry group&mdash;but a very active and certainly an extremely enterprising one. They have used imagination and innovation and have won for Australia a bigger share of the world book market by being enterprising, taking our product abroad, being assiduous about attending trade fairs and promoting the small publishers in Australia&mdash;the small businesses that this government claims to represent. They say that this bill is against their interest and against the interest of Australia maintaining a key position world on book publishing. The furniture association says similar things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At previous hearings, we have heard the reason why Australia is a world leader in the manufacture and export of fast, aluminium catamaran ferries&mdash;a market worth half a billion dollars worth of exports a year. It is because, in the initial start&hyphen;up phase of that industry, they took advantage of the export market development grants. They took advantage of circumstances which this government 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> now wishes to change and change in a regressive way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reject the economic rationalist thinking that is behind this bill&mdash;that thinking which argues that, if you cut out these industry supports, the cold winds of the marketplace will determine that the strong will win and the weak will fail. The trouble with that theory is that we are talking about small business in Australia; that is, small business that does not have the market strength of bigger business that will compete with overseas businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the cold winds of economic rationalist theory blow through the Australian small business market in export, they abolish that market. They overrun it; they overwhelm it. It means that, certainly, the fit will survive, but they will not be Australian companies. Our current account deficit will blow out to a greater level, which will have a consequential effect not only on unemployment in this nation but also on interest rates and inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is a very important bill. The opposition is strongly opposed to cutting back the export market development grants scheme in the manner proposed. Certainly, we are strongly opposed to capping the scheme. The important and distinctive feature of this scheme is that those who want to export, those who have the initiative and entrepreneurial drive to seek markets offshore from Australia for goods or services manufactured here can access the support this scheme offers and access it according to the amount of effort they put in. It is not picking winners. It is backing winners. Those that want to have a go are supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is proposing to cap the amount of support and to limit and narrow the amount of areas in which those companies can qualify. What is offensive to me about that is all of the things that I have said. But when you look at whether this scheme works or not, the evidence is unequivocal: this scheme works. There are a number of things that you do to promote exports, that you do not being certain about what the practical impact is, and you spend public money in order to help achieve a practical outcome. After you have done that for a while, you audit whether or not it has succeeded. If it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2492"> has, you encourage it. If it has not, you modify it and, if it is a failure, you abolish it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the export market development grants scheme, it has been independently refereed by Professor Bewley of the University of New South Wales. He is a distinguished econometrician in Australia. He has calculated that, for every dollar spent on this scheme&mdash;every dollar of taxpayers' money&mdash;the return to the nation is between $9 and $20. If Australian taxpayers could be sure that if they put $1 down and get a return of between $9 to $20 on that dollar, I am sure that they would say, `This is a good investment.' Certainly, if I were an investor and I could put down $1 and get between $9 and $20 back, I would regard that as a good investment. This is&mdash;I underline this&mdash;independent refereeing of this scheme. That is what the independent academic who reviewed this scheme said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does Austrade say? Austrade is the government's agency here. It is the agency through which this scheme is operated. In its comments in the last budget, it said that the scheme returns up to one to 33; that is, for $1 up to $33 returned. In the face of all that, there is one stark question: why would you cut back a scheme that returns that value to the nation? It returns that value to the nation, at a time when we have a current account deficit of $20 billion, representing four per cent of gross domestic product, and when the Prime Minister himself has said that the most urgent economic problem for this nation is to reel back that current account deficit. It makes no sense. It is for that key reason that we are opposed to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in my earlier remarks, this bill imposes a cap on a scheme which is currently uncapped. This bill proposes that no more than $150 million be spent in support of this scheme, that is to say, we make a $9 to $20 return, or one to 33 per cent return. But, by God, we're not going to put too much money down in order to achieve that outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cap, however, reduces what has been in recent budgets the estimate of how much money would be spent on the scheme. In recent budgets, I recall, the estimated outlays under the scheme would be between about $220 million and $250 million. So we are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cutting about $90 million out of it or, as my colleague in the other place, the Hon. Stephen Smith, has said, over four years $142 million&mdash;according to the budget figures&mdash;will be cut out of the scheme. That is $142 million to which there is an advantage of one to nine or one to 20 or, in Austrade's figures, one to 33.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is not all. An administrative charge is to be cut from that outlay of $150 million. That administrative charge is five per cent. There goes $7.5 million; the $150 million becomes $142.5 million. Of course, this a grants scheme and recipients of grants have to declare them as income in their tax and pay tax on them. The corporate tax rate is 36 per cent. When you apply the 36 per cent tax rate to the scheme, there goes another $51.3 million. So the actual outlay to the Commonwealth is $91.2 million. But I bet you that the Commonwealth will run around this nation and say, `We are putting $150 million into encouraging exports.' They will not say that that is about $90 million less than last year. They will not say that they are clawing back over $50 million and that the real figure is only $91.2 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other element of this legislation is to narrow the eligibility for this scheme, and that affects small business. Let me recite the areas of narrowing of eligibility. Trusts are to be excluded although I understand now, from amendments foreshadowed by the government, that the government will relent on that and trusts will be included. Air fares are essential to export. You need to get into the market and, unless you sail, the only way of getting there is to fly but air fares are to be limited and be ineligible after two years. We are moving an amendment in that regard, and I trust and hope that the government can support that amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the biggest problems for Australian companies is protecting their patent rights. We are an inventive country. We have got good scientists. Too often we see their ideas taken overseas and turned into products or services by others and sold back to us. This scheme limits the ability of Australian companies that have taken our scientific base and turned it into products here to protect and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2493"> defend their patents and their intellectual property in the world. We are moving amendments on that. Overseas buyers' visits to Australia, foreign language training, international business education courses, export packaging and labelling design, tenders and quotations, free technical information and subscriptions to industry associations are all to be limited under this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put the final touch to it, this bill contains what I describe as delegated legislation. This bill reposes in Austrade, an organisation that I have a high regard for but it is a public sector organisation nonetheless, the right to make business and entrepreneurial decisions about whether businesses are capable or should be given money for a grant. Clearly, government has to discriminate about what is the difference between success and failure but I say this as a cautionary note: none of the guidelines under which Austrade will make those decisions has yet been published. The government could have brought those guidelines forward now&mdash;we could have seen them and, if we could know what the guidelines were, that would be a good signal to industry. But they have not been published and we do not know what they contain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We only have assurances about them, and I hope that those assurances&mdash;given in the committee hearing&mdash;can be supported by the parliamentary secretary at the table and at least then we will know, under the Acts Interpretation Act, that that is the government's view. But delegated legislation is a thorny issue for the Senate, rightly so and for good reason. What the government wants to do should be clear, should be transparent and the appeal rights should be well set out. That is not the case here and I oppose those areas of delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that I want to acknowledge that the parliamentary secretary, David Brownhill, has been prepared to talk to the opposition and negotiate with us about our concerns in a constructive manner. I acknowledge that. All too often in politics there is nothing but criticism. I want to damage his career, I hope not, by praising his constructiveness here and also that of his minister, Tim Fischer. I also say that this is an import 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ant bill and we will oppose all those features I have referred to. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Cook, for a very good summation. I first want to deal with the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee which, in such a short period of time, pulled out all the stops to produce a very helpful set of hearings and a report. In the rush and pressure that we are experiencing in this overconcertinaed period, in which we are looking at so many important bills, the secretariats that serve our committees deserve proper commendation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The secretariat of the legislation committee were so rushed that they actually could not even advertise the hearings. Yet nearly 50 submissions came in in a very short period of time. This is a bill on which there has been an outpouring of rage by persons affected and by organisations that are concerned with and understand the export milieu.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This scheme is now 23 years old. It began under that giant of the political landscape, Gough Whitlam. It was continued under the Liberal governments that followed his government and by the Labor governments that followed those governments. In each case, amendments were made to, and reviews were made of, the legislation so it is now, in our opinion and in the opinion of informed observers, one of the most effective and most worthy of all business and export assistance schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not, and has not been, a scheme which is subject to expenditure blow&hyphen;out or to any substantial abuse. It is a scheme which has had a total of 69,234 grants made between 1974 and 1991. Most grants average around $61,000. The total grants for 1995&hyphen;96 are recorded at $202 million. But those grants are taxable in the hands of the recipient, so the real value of the scheme has been limited to around $120 million in net cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not an expensive scheme for the benefits it delivers to Australia; the real killer is the actual exports generated under the scheme. In 1995&hyphen;96, the exports generated were $5.07 billion. I will lead on to that later. How any Treasurer who has to pay attention to our balance of trade deficit as well as our 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2494"> budget deficit can attack such a productive scheme throws great light on his lack of judgment and his lack of discretion. The ratio of exports to grants has actually been improving. In other words, it is an extremely efficient scheme. From 1992 to 1993 the ratio rose to 21 to one. As Senator Cook has outlined, it is now recorded as in the low thirties to one. It is an extremely efficient scheme with a very high multiplier content.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am of the opinion that you have to have a mix of policies in the pursuit of Australia's export goals. I am beginning to have the opinion that we need a better mix in the cabinet. Eight lawyers, four farmers, a doctor, a diplomat and a businessman sat there and agreed to this cut. It shows me that they really do need to look at their prioritisation. I commend both the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade (Mr Brownhill), because I am aware that both of them fought to keep this scheme alive. It is my information that it was the intention of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to destroy it completely. They should be publicly commended for at least allowing it to survive in a truncated manner. The second thing I would like to commend Senator Brownhill for is his willingness to consult and to negotiate on this matter. That makes it far more easy to resolve legislation which so materially affects the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats have the view that the scheme should not be capped. Accordingly, I will be moving a motion at the end of my address that the scheme not be capped. We believe that its growth has not been open ended and fearsome to the budget; it has been regulated, controlled and quite well managed. It is fashionable and probably realistic to criticise those authorities that have to manage these schemes because they do not get everything right. But, by and large, Austrade has a reputation for having managed the scheme well. It should be commended for doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation has two motivations. Before damning it completely, I should indicate that the Australian Democrats believe there are many improvements in the bill. Those amendments are based on the efficiency audits of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the scheme by the Australia National Audit Office&mdash;another accountability mechanism which very frequently does a good job in assisting in the efficient management of the country. In this respect the bill reflects a number of positive aspects in terms of administrative, managerial and operating effectiveness. But the bill&mdash;this is where our criticisms will be focused in this debate&mdash;alters the character of the EMDG scheme, the export market development grants scheme, in two fundamental respects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, it alters it from an open&hyphen;ended to a capped scheme. That will result in far more discretion, far more of a winner picking mentality within Austrade. Secondly, it reduces the budget from $204 million&mdash;I think it was expected to reach $212 million this year on an open access basis&mdash;to $150 million. That is a reduction of nearly $70 million. But the real reduction, as I said, will be far less because this is a scheme where the grants are taxable in the hands of the individual. In other words, the government is claiming a saving of nearly $70 million, but the real saving will be about $40 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our main concerns with this bill reflect those of the majority committee. It should be pointed out that many coalition members are very disturbed by some of the trends emerging in this bill. We have focused on trusts: we commend the government for its changes to trusts as a result of submissions from the community affected by this bill, from the committee itself, from the opposition and from us. We want to accord our gratitude to you for your responsiveness. I will be putting up amendments during the committee stage; I will deal with trusts at greater length at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area which I understand is attended to as a result of the trusts amendment is the element of retrospectivity. Persons who, quite rightly, made decisions about how they would spend money this year discovered only in December, nearly five months after the budget, that what they were proposing to do would now be rendered retrospectively inapplicable under the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area that the government, the Democrats and the opposition have come to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2495"> agreement on is that of air fares. We concur with the view, and from long and practical experience it is the right view, that air fares are the single most important mechanism for promoting exports because they promote face&hyphen;to&hyphen;face interaction. If you want to persuade people you talk to them face to face. That is why in this parliament we do not sit in front of our television sets all the time. We actually come down here and talk to each other. In the most important debate that seems to have been around in terms of people's consciences, the euthanasia debate, they were all here listening and reacting. The face&hyphen;to&hyphen;face mechanism is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next concern we have, and we wish we did not have this concern because it is a huge and costly drain on exporters and it is quite a large component of the eligibility mechanism, is the costs of patents, trademarks and other intellectual property. It is a fact of life that if you have a brand of good or service of any kind, if you want to compete internationally you have to make sure you are protected, otherwise you will arrive with your little bag of tricks and they will get stolen from you. It is as simple as that. The patents, trademarks and other intellectual property protections are designed to prevent your competitors from stealing your brand of goods or services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last area really refers to the nature of Austrade's discretion. Austrade is a statutory authority and its discretion would be less of a concern under an open access scheme. But as soon as you cap a scheme it results in a situation where they themselves have to distinguish, subjectively sometimes, between applicants. That means that the criteria for selection needs to be particularly well developed as a consequence and there does need to be a proper reviewable system. I should indicate to government that there is a problem with the capping of the scheme which results in a different way in which Austrade will have to function in terms of distinguishing between applicants and their eligible claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not propose to go through much more in my opening remarks. I am aware we are under time constraints. I would commend to the Senate my minority report which I think expresses the Australian Democrats views 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> succinctly and well. There is a comity of views between the opposition and ourselves on these matters. We will be supporting the opposition amendments. We will be supporting the government amendments. I move:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"but the Senate is of the view that, if the scheme is to be capped, funding for the scheme should be not less than last year's levels."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not want to move to a division. What I would like to do is get an indication from the government, the opposition, Senator Colston and Senator Margetts whether they will support that motion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all those who have spoken in the debate on the Export Market Development Grants Bill. I would also like to thank the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee for the prompt manner in which they dealt with the draft bill. We found the report to be a constructive contribution and that is the way things should happen. The draft bill was sent to the committee so that a debate could take place outside this chamber and the legislation could be dealt with much more quickly when it came before the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We took particular note of some of the comments from the business representatives and also from others during the debate. I think the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) indicated in the other place that he was prepared to consider the issue of trusts and access to the EMDG scheme in the light of that legislation committee's report. The report was tabled on the 20th. I thank Senator Troeth for the job she did as chairperson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has carefully considered both the report and what was put to us. On the strength of the arguments we have decided that the trusts should be included in the scheme and the government amendment which has been circulated to that effect is with you all. The amendment also seeks to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2496"> ensure that trusts are subject to rules so that, in short, they have the same degree of accountability as all other export market development grant claimants. We have had an agreement with the Democrats and others as far as that is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill delivers on the government's commitment to maintain the export market development grant scheme and to provide full rate eligibility for the first time to the tourism industry. It simplifies and better targets the scheme; it supports the SMEs; and it retains a well&hyphen;funded program, despite the budget black hole of the previous government. The EMDG scheme has been assisting Australian exporters for over 22 years, as Senator Cook said. We believe it has assisted many people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two significant measures have been introduced to direct more funds to small and medium enterprises. The minimum expenditure threshold has been lowered to $20,000 per grant to benefit more small and medium size enterprises. In addition, applicants with income in the grant year in excess of $50 million will no longer be eligible to receive a grant for that year, thus freeing up available funds for those exporters most in need of assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also recognised the significant contribution made to our exports by the tourism industry and increasing the grant rate for all tourism providers to the full 50 per cent and allowing free samples of services provided and access to approved joint ventures, I believe, will be a great help. The government has, because of the fiscal legacy we inherited, decided to place a cap on annual funding and this is consistent with the government's wider goal of fiscal restraint. Most importantly, the mechanism for affecting the cap will provide for full payment of smaller grants at the time of determination. As to the point that Senator Murray made, no, we will not be supporting his amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To minimise the potential reduction to individual grants, the government has introduced a number of policy changes which will simplify the scheme, address fraud and better target those SMEs in the early years of exporting. The fundamental principles of the scheme have not been altered. The scheme 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will continue to provide assistance to small and medium Australian exporters and potential exporters through the partial reimbursement of selected promotional cost. Under this bill the scheme retains its open access nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill demonstrates the commitment of the government to assist Australian SMEs to enter and develop export markets. I note Senator Cook's concern about smaller companies. We have retained a well funded EMDG scheme which encourages smaller firms into exports. We have also made substantial progress towards reducing the budget deficit and providing a better macro&hyphen;economic environment for all Australian exporters. All small firms are eligible for grants. Indeed, the bigger impact of the reduced budget for the EMDG is on the larger companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of Austrade's discretionary powers, Senator Murray raised concerns about protecting commercial-in-confidence information. I have checked the provisions within the current Austrade Act 1985. That act provides substantial penalties for any breaches by Austrade staff. They are of the same order that Senator Murray seeks. Therefore, I believe that further amendments on that subject would not be needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To all the people who participated in the debate, I thank you very much again for your kind words. The Senate is a place where I believe we have to look at legislation and do the best thing we can for the community. I take your points on notice. I believe that this scheme will be a better targeted scheme within the constraints that we have under the fiscal responsibility that we have to the taxpayers of Australia. I believe it will make sure that the export industries are assisted well in the next few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank Senator Murray and the other senators for being able to talk about this bill outside the chamber and taking in account what was said at the inquiry. I commend the bill to honourable senators.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Trusts are an extensively used legal mechanism for conducting family and business affairs in Australia. There are, as we know, varying kinds of trusts and they all have characteristics which make them less transparent and often more complex than corporations. It is for this reason that informed commentators are cautious and careful in dealing with some kinds of trusts. However, the fact that trusts may have a reputation that they can be used by a minority in a manner which is not conducive to good social conduct does not mean that the majority of families and businesses using them are operating outside the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should indicate those characteristics of trusts which distinguish trusts from corporate entities and should be noted for the purposes of this amendment. Those characteristics of trusts are as follows. Firstly, the beneficial and ultimate control of the trust is shielded from public disclosure. In contrast to a corporate entity where the shareholders are available in the annual ASC declaration, there is no such mechanism for trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the distribution of income in a trust is generally discretionary and can vary between the beneficiaries year by year. That again is in contrast to a corporate entity whose ASC declaration will indicate the percentage shareholding and, therefore, the percentage entitlement of the shareholders. Thirdly, the beneficiaries of trusts are shielded from the public eye. Once again that is in contrast to a corporate entity where the shareholders are identified in terms of their shareholdings and return, whereas the beneficiaries of trusts are concealed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, trusts may be used to maximise tax effectiveness and planning in ways which are not available to incorporated bodies. The government has indicated that it is going to put trusts under greater scrutiny in this regard, if I understand their signals correctly. Speak 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2500"> ing for the Australian Democrats, we would welcome that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Austrade officials at the hearing made sound and valid points, although they might have expressed themselves a little more clearly I think, about some of the problems they do experience with trusts&mdash;that is, being able to determine exactly what lies behind trusts and who is dealing with them. I was at pains in the question and answer section with one witness to establish whether that witness would have a problem with outlining the exact nature of his trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His answer was no, he was quite happy to show who was in control, who the beneficiaries were and what the percentage distribution of income was because the trust to him was a legal device which maximised his relationship both with his export trade and with his business affairs. My view is that that sort of attitude is likely to pertain to most trustees and participants in trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this amendment is to allow Austrade to require where it wishes&mdash;it is not obligatory; it is a discretion&mdash;for a trust to disclose relevant information about control and beneficiaries if it wishes to proceed with the grants. The second point Austrade made, which was a good one, was that at times it has great difficulty understanding the relationships of trusts to corporate entities and in what manner funds are controlled and moved about. Once again, my Australia Democrat amendment does not allow for Austrade, at its 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> discretion&mdash;it is not obligatory&mdash;to request that information if it needs it in order to make a more informed and more objective decision as to who should get grants and on what basis of eligibility. Accordingly, I commend my amendment to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments relate to eligible expenses and return effectively the provisions of the existing bill. We had, as has been said in the various speeches delivered on this subject today, a quite worthwhile and useful Senate Economics Legislation Committee hearing on this bill. During that hearing an innovative procedure was adopted in which the chairman, Senator Troeth, invited witnesses to the hearing to put their views directly to the Austrade witnesses, who then forthrightly replied to the concerns the industry witnesses had raised. What the industry witnesses were concerned about were matters of interpretation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I indicated during that hearing, and I now wish to implement that indication, that I would ask the government during this phase of debate on this bill whether it adopted the interpretations that Austrade had given the industry in the committee hearing as its understanding of what this bill meant and would do so for the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act. I, therefore, wish to ask: is the parliamentary secretary at the table, Senator Brownhill, in a position to now confirm on behalf of the government the advice that Austrade gave the industry organisations at the hearing that relates to how this bill will be interpreted?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the advice that I have, it is not clear that the Acts Interpretation Act allows the parliamentary secretary to endorse departmental evidence as material to which regard can be had in interpreting the act.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of that answer and in view of the time constraints that we are under, I indicate that I do not think that is an acceptable answer. The purpose of the procedure entered into at the committee was for the industry associations to be able to clear up directly with Austrade in the presence of the committee their concerns about how this act would be administered by the trade commission&mdash;Austrade. If the government is not prepared to back Austrade's interpretation&mdash;and that is the only possible interpretation of the answer just given&mdash;I am not sure what industry should think about the advice given by Austrade. I think their concerns&mdash;and they have raised a number of them in the evidence&mdash;are therefore justified and the pity is that we are under time constraints today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequential pity of that is that we cannot explore this question in great depth other than to say no&hyphen;one should therefore necessarily place their faith in what Austrade has indicated to the committee would be the interpretation. In saying that, I intend, of course, no reflection on Austrade. I am sure those officers conducted themselves as they believed was right and proper. What I do intend is to make a reflection on the government in not backing up that interpretation. I mark this spot in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> for the reason that industry associations should be aware of that when they approach their understanding of how these provisions would be interpreted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that this could be cleared up in a trice. It could be done in the blink of an eye if the government would bring forward the guidelines that obviously have to be published and would accompany the final legislation as a guide to Austrade in its interpretation. The fact that we do not have those before us, and did not have them before the committee, means that the issue is still at large. The industry organisations are still, I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2502"> believe, within their rights and justifiably raising these matters, and the administration of the terms of this bill must be cloudy until the government moves to change it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Monday, the Prime Minister brought down a statement about cutting red tape in small business. One of the big problems for small business in interpreting what their rights are vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis government agencies is vagueness and uncertainty. They do not have discretionary time to hire advisers and to advise them&mdash;they do not have the discretionary finance to do that&mdash;and they do not have the discretionary time to spend on trying to work it all out for themselves. I think it is a terrible state of affairs that this vagueness now continues, and it works against the very purpose that the government proclaims this bill to serve, namely to simplify the administrative system of the export market development grants. With those words, I, of course, persist in my amendments. I will take the vote on the voices.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my contribution to the second reading debate I spoke about how these provisions in the government bill narrow eligibility. The headings that I have just read out are the areas being made narrower, where eligibility is reduced. The purpose of these amendments is to turn back those provisions in the bill, letting the legislation essentially stand in its current state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, it is perhaps important for me to register strongly that the provision relating to expenses for registration of eligible intellectual property rights is important because Australia is a small country and, as an exporting nation, is open to piracy of its intellectual property and open to breach of its patents. Where that occurs in foreign countries, our exporters have to go to the legal jurisdictions of those foreign countries to enforce our rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no tougher jurisdiction to go to than the United States. If we are exporting sophisticated goods to the US and our patents are breached in the United States, our companies have to then undertake a proceeding in a US court before a US jury with a US judge disposed to the US national interest. Without criticising the American legal system, I must say that in arguing that in a US court it is very difficult indeed to win a positive decision. So we start from behind the eight ball anyway. The changes that the government would make to the Austrade bill would make it even more difficult. If we cannot protect our intellectual property, if we cannot have our patents respected, the effort that companies have made in developing that property or those patents is rendered as zero.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think one of the biggest issues in international trade is about the protection of intellectual property. It is an issue that the United States has made a feature of, particularly in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> its relations with China, where open abuse and piracy does occur, and in relation to other countries. I think it behoves us, Australia, who are essentially a small player in the world marketplace, to be rigorous in protecting our standards here. That is the reason behind that amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I asked for this to be dealt with separately because it places us right in the middle of the problem that results from capping, and that is that capping inevitably requires choice between eligibility and the allocation of funds. As Senator Cook would have been aware from my speech on the second reading motion, I have a particularly keen interest in clause 38C within his amendment. However, it is tied up with the entire amendment, and a later amendment to be put by me addresses that particular question. Our problem is that, once the bill is passed and a cap imposed, we recognise that the best use of money available then needs to be made. Our focus, as I spelt out earlier, is undoubtedly on air fares and intellectual property. If this was an uncapped scheme, Senator Cook, I would support you wholeheartedly, but I regret that, because it is a capped scheme, I have decided to oppose it.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to make a point about the secrecy provisions for trust information. An earlier amendment that was passed unanimously on the floor meant that Austrade could ask trusts to give them information. But, of course, that information will remain the private matter of a disclosure to Austrade and not to the public as a whole, and it is appropriate for that disclosure to occur. It is not appropriate for trusts, as has been formerly the case, to receive public money and taxpayers' grants when control of those trusts and the beneficiaries have been concealed. We have now made that a far more transparent and open process. I am very pleased that the government has accepted that principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the proposed Democrat amendment 23, I have been informed by the parliamentary secretary that the act does currently ensure that any information requested of trusts will be treated with due regard to commercial confidentiality and that the process for doing so is already well established. If the parliamentary secretary is willing to put that on the record and explain how the existing secrecy provisions and protection of private information operates, I will be happy to not proceed with the amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have this legislation back before us. We will be moving, once again, hopefully with a different result from that of last time, the completely unexceptionable amendment to ensure that this act does not conflict with the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I said `completely unexceptionable amendment' is that this government found it completely unexceptionable and unobjectionable when they accepted it in relation to the rights of social security recipients, with not the slightest difficulty. Senator Tambling, representing the government here in the Senate, said so. Senator Tambling in fact said that because the government asserted that that legislation did not conflict with the Racial Discrimination Act, as the government asserts this legislation does not, then the government had not the slightest difficulty in accepting the amendment, which was moved in precisely the same terms as the one that is currently before the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record clearly shows, despite repeated questioning from me, the leader of the Democrats, Senator Kernot, and, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2510"> I believe, Senator Margetts of the Greens, the minister on not one single occasion provided the slightest explanation for the distinction between the concerns the government has in accepting this amendment in this respect and the lack of concern the government had with the social security legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only explanation the minister offered was that the government did not want to accept this amendment because it would provide the possibility of enhancing the prospect of some legal challenge. In fact, the minister produced with a flourish, like a magician producing a rabbit from a hat, advice from the Department of the Attorney-General saying that, and then thought I had said something extraordinary when I agreed with the advice from the Department of the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I pointed out to the minister, I have not the slightest doubt&mdash;in fact, I challenge him to put the question again&mdash;that, if the same question had been put to the Department of the Attorney-General, in respect of accepting this amendment for the social security legislation, then the answer from the Department of the Attorney-General would have been in precisely the same terms. It was an unexceptional answer from the Department of the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you put additional provisions into pieces of legislation that make it clear that the legislation does not conflict with another act, of course you will, by simple definition, increase the opportunity for people to put a legal challenge against it. It gives them another ground for doing so. So none of that was particularly exceptional or noteworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the minister utterly failed to do, having given that explanation, was to explain why that problem in respect of the social security legislation apparently was of no concern to the government when it would have had precisely the same effect. I might add that it was not a non&hyphen;controversial issue&mdash;double negatives are dreadful things; I will rephrase that to say `another controversial issue'&mdash;as those provisions in the social security legislation were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what the government and the minister failed to do&mdash;I will give the minister the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opportunity to correct that now&mdash;was to provide any kind of rational distinction as to why people affected by the Social Security Act, social security recipients, are entitled to the protection of this amendment&mdash;and the government, without question, without an argument, happily accepted it, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record shows&mdash;but Aborigines apparently are not. The government has a concern that they do not want to open up any additional legal grounds for Aborigines, but they are perfectly happy to provide that opportunity to beneficiaries from social security provisions. I invite the minister to attempt to make the distinction between the two pieces of legislation, which he failed to do last time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another important question. The reason I make this point is that, despite the minister's best efforts, and the government's generally, at misrepresentation in reporting after that debate, the opposition was not, in fact, opposing the government's legislation or the building of the bridge at all, as we had made clear again and again some time ago. It was pointed out that that was not the position of others. We were not opposing the passage of this legislation last time nor the building of the bridge. We simply wanted to make it clear that the government's assertion that there was no conflict between this legislation and the RDA was a fact by the government, as they say in the classics, putting its money where its mouth is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Had the government accepted the RDA amendment the last time this legislation came into the Senate in the same happy way they accepted exactly the same amendment to the Social Security Act, then the bill would have been passed in the Senate at that time. We will be pressing that amendment again today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that needs to be pointed out in this debate is that the people who are directly affected by this legislation, which for them is the effective repeal of this federal act in so far as their interests in Hindmarsh Island are concerned, is that they are the victims. The government can blame who it likes for the problems that this application has caused. It can blame the former government, and indeed it has. It can blame deficiencies in the act, which to this point in time I do not think 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2511"> it has. Perhaps the minister has not bothered to read the Evatt report on this legislation; after eight months, the government has certainly failed to respond to it, which I think is a very relevant matter to raise during this debate, and it will not be the last thing I say about it during the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government can blame all sorts of other things. But the one thing that the government cannot blame for all of the delays is the Ngarrindjeri women. All they were doing was exercising the rights they, like any Australians, had under the law. They were not responsible in any way, shape or form for any difficulties that may then have occurred under the legislation. But it is their rights that are being affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition, with the greatest respect to the minister, does not think that asking the government to accept a modest amendment to taking the government and the minister at their word&mdash;that there is going to be no transgression to the RDA&mdash;is a very large or unreasonable ask at all on behalf of the small group of Aboriginal women in South Australia who are having this federal act repealed&mdash;in effect, their application to their interests. That is in fact what is happening. It has been the sorry history of this country&mdash;unfortunately, it is a history that is being repeated today and has been repeated since March last year&mdash;that the victims are always the ones who get the blame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I do not think that you can fairly say that the women whose rights are being removed by the passage of this legislation are in any way, shape or form to blame for any problems that may well have occurred. That matter is laid out very fairly and very cogently in this report, which has been sitting on your desk now for eight months, not responded to. I will be asking you again today, as I did in Senate estimates, when we are all likely to see a formal government response to the Evatt review of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. The problems that are attached to this act, none of which are brought back to the Ngarrindjeri women, are clearly laid out in this report.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will briefly refer you, Minister, to the genesis of this legislation. I was very familiar with the genesis of this legislation. It was a former minister for Aboriginal affairs, Clive Holding, who introduced it. The federal government made it absolutely clear at the time that it was not even intending this legislation to be legislation at first resort; it was intending it to be of last resort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something else that I will quote from this report shortly relates to the fact that, when you consider the tiny number of occasions&mdash;tiny number of occasions&mdash;when declarations have been made under this act in all the years that it has been in existence, I do not think that you can make out a fair case that this legislation has been abused or overused by anybody. In fact, the cold hard facts are that there is only one declaration in existence today in the whole of Australia, that is in Alice Springs&mdash;one. Why was the act brought in in the first place? Minister Holding, when he introduced it, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a State or Territory has no law capable of providing effective protection, or no action is being taken to give effect to that law, the Commonwealth will act in appropriate cases. It is open to the States to ensure that effective heritage protection is offered by their legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then the report of the Hon. Justice Elizabeth Evatt says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Twelve years later this hope has not been realised. The result is that the Commonwealth Act is often called on as a substitute for State protection&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It also is worth advising the Senate of what an organisation closely connected with the operation of this act said about that. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effectiveness of the Act in providing protection for areas of significance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is limited by incompatible and inadequate legislation operating in a number of States. This has created a situation where the Commonwealth Act is invoked to provide primary site protection rather than, as the scheme of the Act suggests, a last resort of back&hyphen;up to legislation in the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That statement was made to this review by the Aboriginal Sites Protection Authority of the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, sadly, the stated intention&mdash;I think a laudatory one&mdash;of the Commonwealth by introducing this act 12 years ago to fill an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2512"> appallingly obvious deficiency in the protection of these important sites&mdash;sites not just important to the cultural heritage of Aboriginal people but, at the end of the day, to all Australians&mdash;and to try to encourage the states to introduce appropriate legislation of their own, has regrettably, at the time of writing this report and now as we speak, failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply want to point out again, as we have in the past, the appalling deficiency of state legislatures in failing to provide appropriate protection. In some cases, that has probably simply been by a process of neglect. In other cases, I think that, because of the controversy that sometimes surrounds these issues, states are perfectly happy to leave the Commonwealth to grasp the nettle when they do not want the controversy landing on their own doorsteps. But, of course, on a number of occasions the failure has been because of the absolute open and stated hostility to the rights of Aboriginal people in any case to have any protection for their heritage at all.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins interjected that I might help by voting for the RDA amendments. It was quite clear last time that the Racial Discrimination Act amendments were the means by which the opposition were giving themselves an excuse to support the bill. Senator Collins and a number of people from the opposition benches quite 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lucidly condemned the bill. But they gave themselves an excuse to support it if an RDA amendment was tacked on. Now they have changed their position and said, `Look, we like the bill so much, we will support it any way.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has indicated that, being as it is so close to the South Australian election, they will jump on this populist bandwagon. And here we are again.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, he did not. I am paraphrasing, that is true. I am putting my own spin on the fact that the South Australian election is just around the corner. Last time, the opposition made some wonderful comments about how rotten the bill was. Guess what? The bill is just as rotten as it was then. What they are saying now is that, whatever happens in the RDA amendments, they are going to support the rotten bill&mdash;`What else can you say? I have to now leave it to you to decide what the rationale was for the change in the decision.' The bill is still as rotten as it was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate the comments that Senator Collins made about the Evatt report. Most people will be getting letters from people who are concerned that perhaps the issue that has been left out is the fact that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 fails to provide protection for people with information of a sensitive nature that cannot be given in the normal form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was fairly disgraceful to hear the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) mention that, if this information was real, it would be written down by an anthropologist. That forgets the fact that the concerns and the issues of Aboriginal law, if they are as they have been stated, could not have been written down. Therefore, going back and saying, `It is not written down, therefore it does not exist' is contradictory. You would either say, `These issues of Aboriginal law are not and never are relevant' or say, `Yes, cultural issues are important, and we as a parliament need to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2513"> move some way towards recognition of cultural values and cultural law.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we do not have any recognition of that, one wonders what the purpose is of having an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, if not to protect those visual elements of culture which we know are all to our benefit. In the Middle East and in Europe, people spend a lot of time, effort, money, resources and person hours protecting archaeological sites of 100 years, 200 years, 1,000 years. In Australia, often we are dealing with issues of physical cultural heritage that might be 25,000 years old, but sometimes we build roads through them or take rock carvings out of their place and put them in a pile and say that we have protected them. We do not value Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage as we should in Australia. Other people in the world do value their cultural heritage. We do not put the value on it that we should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this act of 1984 is some recognition that we ought to be moving in the direction of doing something about protecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage. But it has been shown by Justice Elizabeth Evatt to be deficient. It is my understanding that both sides of government have indicated that they agree something ought to be done about it. Obviously, therefore, I indicate that at the third reading stage I will be moving an amendment to that effect to look at this issue. Of course, even though the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has given it to the states to look at, that will give the states the opportunity, as well as other interested parties, to give their evidence and their opinions. Hopefully, by that stage the Commonwealth will have an opinion written down and will be able to provide us with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Racial Discrimination Act, I stated quite clearly and categorically the last time this bill was dealt with in the Senate that I fully support the Racial Discrimination Act. What I did not support was its being used as an excuse to support a revolting bill. As I said, the bill is just as revolting&mdash;it has not changed. What is the case now is that the opposition has indicated that, whatever hap 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pens in relation to racial discrimination, it is no longer as concerned&mdash;that is paraphrasing as well&mdash;that the bill might go through without a Racial Discrimination Act amendment on it. They will support the bill anyway. Therefore, I am forced to say that, because of my support for the Racial Discrimination Act and not because of my support for the bill, I will support the amendment. But, of course, my opposition to this still revolting bill stands.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concur with the comments Senator Margetts made about Australia's failure to value Aboriginal cultural heritage. We will be supporting her third reading amendment to refer this really important report to a committee for response. That is one way of getting a response and at least it gets the issue back on the public agenda for debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the matter of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill itself, the Democrats' position is clearly on the record. It has not changed. We do not think that this is just a bill about building a bridge. It is a bill which legislates for discrimination. Nothing about its recommittal here has changed that fundamental fact. Yes, I agree, procedurally this issue has been an absolute nightmare. That means we should look at the procedures. We do not seek a little piece of specific legislation to deal with a particular problem. That is the way a lot of state governments want to go: got a problem; special piece of legislation; get rid of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the long history of this bill tells us is that the processes do not work. Some of the solution is in this report yet we have not even considered it before we get to this bill. As we know the political expediency of the numbers here, this bill is going to go through now. It is because I think that will not be the end of the matter that I want to take just a couple of minutes to look at some of the legal points in relation to the issue of discrimination. I think that there will be an appeal and I want to take this last opportunity to put a couple of things on the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Article 14 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and the first optional protocol 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2514"> to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both of which Australia has ratified, provide a right of individual petition to an international committee for breach of either convention. Miss Jennifer Clarke, a lecturer in law at the ANU, in her submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill, canvassed the articles in these conventions which provide a right of complaint for the Ngarrindjeri women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the convention on the elimination of racial discrimination those articles are article 1, which clearly prohibits racial discrimination and defines discrimination as any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin in relation to any human rights or fundamental freedom, including freedom of religion; and article 5, which guarantees racial equality before the law. In the light of those particular articles, I think one can argue that this bill is clearly seen as discriminating against the Ngarrindjeri women and other groups of people seeking to use similar laws, because it removes their right at law to have their claim dealt with under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights has much broader forms of human rights obligations, but the relevant articles are similar to those that I have just articulated. Article 18 protects freedom of religion and article 27 protects minority cultural rights, both of which apply to the present case. It is my understanding that, for an action under these conventions to be successful, the Ngarrindjeri women will need to prove an additional two elements: firstly, that the applicants are a victim&mdash;Senator Collins has already used that description several times in the debate&mdash;and, secondly, that they have exhausted all domestic remedies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have to do is to fall back on the Human Rights Committee's 1992 decision, in Toonan v. Australia, which dealt with the definition of victims, giving it a wide meaning. As neither of the applicants in that case had actually been subject to the criminal law which they claimed violated their human 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rights under the ICCPR, the Tasmanian government had urged the Commonwealth to state that they were therefore not victims of the law. But Toonan argued that the laws had created the conditions for discrimination in employment, constant stigmatisation, vilification, threats of physical violence and a violation of basis democratic rights. The committee accepted this expanded notion of victim and stated that the threat of enforcement and the pervasive impact of the continued existence of these provisions on administrative practices and public opinion had affected and continued to affect Toonan detrimentally. So there is an expanded notion of victim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that the Ngarrindjeri women's arguments relate to abuse of their cultural history and an ongoing sense of humiliation and degradation because of the proposed bridge, there is a case that they could be deemed victims for the purpose of the two conventions. The second test, the second point, of whether or not all domestic remedies have been exhausted, also applies. Where can the Ngarrindjeri women go now? The short answer is that here they have nowhere to go. In their own country and as a result of the exemption created by this bill, the Ngarrindjeri women are about to be dispossessed again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this is appealed, if this is taken to an international adjudicator, and if the action is successful, Australia will for the second time this decade distinguish itself in the international arena as a nation which actively discriminates against its citizens. I do not believe that this Senate or the parliament as a whole should be a party to legislation which actively sets up such discrimination. Whatever your views might be on development, on that whole development debate&mdash;in this case, it is a specific bridge&mdash;I do not believe, as a member of this Senate, that any senators should support legislation which seeks so blatantly to remove current legal rights from a particular group of people. That is why the Democrats do not support this bill. It is not about whether you want a bridge or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I indicate our support for the ALP amendment. Our position has not altered. The arguments Senator Bob Collins advanced are just 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2515"> as relevant as they were last time around. I think they have been strengthened by the addition of the Evatt report comments. As I said, we will be also supporting Senator Margetts's third reading amendment. We think it is really important to consider the implications of the Evatt report. The government has not. Therefore, an inquiry by a parliamentary committee is both appropriate and timely.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join in this debate because I think it is a vital one for the sort of society we live in. I accept and agree with what has been said by all the speakers before me. I just want to say something about the Racial Discrimination Act because it is one of three acts that set, within the Australian scene, something like a bill of rights&mdash;a bill of rights that this parliament has set up. The three are: the Racial Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act and the Disability Discrimination Act. That whole regime that we set up to make sure that there is no discrimination is important not only for the Aboriginals but for all of us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember former Senator Button, the Leader of the Government in the Senate as he then was&mdash;in one of his quirky moods, which often occurred&mdash;talking about discrimination and saying that there ought not be ageism. Everybody said, `Of course there should not be ageism.' It seemed a funny thing at the time. But there can be ageism. We have understood that and, as a result, there is now in the Workplace Relations Act a provision that says people should not be discriminated against in their work because of their age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is something about all of us and about everybody in Australia that others can pick out and use to discriminate against us. It is not just racism; it is not just sexual matters; it is not just a disability. It can be anything. It can be age. Senator Bob Collins, facetiously perhaps, said that there might be prejudice against largeism. Well, there could be. It is just another illustration of how people can pick out something and use it against us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we do not stick by the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act in this matter, it is not just the Aboriginals, the indigenous 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people, who will be put at risk; everybody has the possibility of being discriminated against because of some particular feature of their body or their beliefs or some other aspect. That is what is so important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take up the point that Senator Kernot made that, if there is some expectation about some legal proceedings, then there is a concern about that. But, as I understand it, there are no legal proceedings in operation at the moment. As things now stand, there is no reason why this bridge should not go ahead. But the fundamental principle that must be maintained is that there should be absolutely no suggestion of discrimination because of a particular aspect&mdash;as I said, of a person's race, body, sex, or indeed any other feature.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond to some of the points raised. Senator Bob Collins raised the social security bill and tried to draw an analogy between that and the government's response. I do not think that is valid because there can be no comparison. The Hindmarsh Island legislation and the building of a bridge has been a highly litigated issue, as you know, over three years at least with the expenditure of over $4 million. To draw an analogy or suggest an apparent inconsistency with the social security legislation I think is invalid. I would also point out that the opposition opposed precisely this amendment to the Native Title Bill in 1993 for the same reasons as the government now opposes it. Our legal advice is that there is no inconsistency with the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts spoke about the Heritage Protection Act, and I share her concerns and those of Senator Collins that the Heritage Protection Act has been found not to function. The previous government set up the Evatt inquiry into it. We have received that report. I have read it, Senator Collins. I issued a press release late last year announcing proposals for reforming the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. Under those proposals, as it was previously the Commonwealth act will be retained as an act of last resort to apply where state and territory 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2516"> legislation does not meet national minimum standards or where national interest considerations exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The processes for granting protection to Aboriginal sacred sites under the Commonwealth act will also be substantially improved. A discussion paper on the national minimum standards is being sent for comment to the states and territories, indigenous, mining, pastoral and other relevant interests today. The Evatt report on the Heritage Protection Act is also being sent out for comment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Margetts does appreciate that reforming the Heritage Protection Act is a complex undertaking. Proper consultations will be required with a wide range of interested parties, including the states and territories and indigenous people, pastoralists and miners. This will take time. However, it is intended that the legislation will be passed by the end of the year. We do not believe that there is any advantage by slowing this process up. We will have it through by the end of the year and we seek your indulgence that that process will achieve the desired objective that all of us wish to achieve. I will speak further on that, if necessary, when you move your amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot said&mdash;and I agree with her&mdash;that procedurally it has been an absolute nightmare. Observers on all sides would agree with that. I could not agree with her more in that regard. That is the very reason that we have come to this stage of introducing this legislation&mdash;to end the nightmare. That will only be achieved by the passage of this legislation. It may well be that there is an appeal to an international body or that there may be further legal recourse. So be it; that is the way of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cooney, with his usual erudite and intellectual analysis, approached the issue from another point of view. But I would point out to Senator Cooney that he made one factual error. The Chapmans did seek an order for yet another reporter, then withdrew it because of this legislation. So it is possible that there would be further action if this bill did not go through, Senator Cooney. It is a hypothetical, I suppose, at this stage, but it&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot and Senator Margetts both referred to the cultural and religious beliefs of the Ngarrindjeri women, indeed Aboriginal people generally, and religious beliefs are at the root of a lot of the complaints that I have received about the support that has been given to these Aboriginal women in South Australia.</PARA>

I suggest that those people that are genuinely interested in the debate&mdash;and I accept that their interest is genuine, even though I might disagree with their position on it&mdash;should read the Evatt report. It is a comprehensive, authoritative document all in one volume that actually lays out precisely what the effect of this act has been. I want to quote from page 2 of the report. Under the heading `How effective has the act been?', the subheading is `Few areas have been protected by declarations'. The terms of reference, of course, require Justice Evatt to report on this. The terms of reference ask for the report to cover:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Justice Evatt goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One indicator of effectiveness is the number of places that have been protected by the Act, directly or indirectly.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Remember: this act has been in operation for 12 years. Only four declarations have been made under section 10 in relation to areas. No section 10 declarations have been made in respect of areas in New South Wales or Queensland, despite the large number of applications from those states. Few short&hyphen;term declarations have been made under section 9, which applies to serious and immediate threats. Furthermore, two of the four declarations under section 10 were overturned by the

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Isn't it true that about 10,750 of the 25,000 applicants for Austudy whose applications had been assessed for this academic year have had their applications reassessed as a consequence of your backflip on the Austudy actual means test on 20 February? Can you, Minister, confirm that the department has now discovered that it has misunderstood the actual means test procedure yet again? Can you confirm that the department has failed to take into account the requirement that, where taxable income exceeds actual means, the taxable income is to be used as the basis for the assessment? How many of the 10,750 reassessed applications will need to be re&hyphen;reassessed because of this error?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Denman for the question. In the vicinity of 10,000 people were reassessed&mdash;you say as a consequence of a backflip. I cannot resist the opportunity and the obligation of clarifying for you what actually happened with relation to the Austudy difficulties in February.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In July last year I received a brief advising that we should discard the imputation arrangements endorsed by the previous government&mdash;that is, where someone's actual means were assessed not on the basis of what they said they had spent but, on the previous government's formula, on the basis of what it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2519"> was decided they must have had available to them as actual means to spend. It was put to me that such a system was seen by the Austudy clients as arbitrary and unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I agreed that that system should be disposed of and that we should shift to a system of self&hyphen;declaration of expenditure combined with some reasonable compliance measures. One measure flagged in the brief was to run the self&hyphen;declared expenditures by Austudy applicants against ABS minimums&mdash;that is taking, as I understand it, the minimum expenditure on any particular item and, if the cost is cheaper in the city, using the city cost and, if the cost is cheaper in the country, using the country cost, using metropolitan, regional and rural costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Somewhere between that brief and the actual implementation, that compliance measure&mdash;that is, `Run their expenditures past a minimum. If they're spending a lot less than the minimum, we better check up on them'&mdash;was incorporated as the assessment measure. Senator Denman, if you had the opportunity to be at the estimates committee, you would appreciate that there is not yet an explanation as to how or why that happened in the department.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics published its business expectation survey where businesses comment on their expected performance for the short and medium term from the June quarter through to the March quarter next year. What do these figures indicate; and what do these figures tell us about how small business in Australia is faring?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="2520" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These figures are very important to the government, because this is a government that is interested in the wellbeing of small business&mdash;business in general, but small business in particular, because we know how hard small business had to do it under the previous Labor government. The figures are quite pleasing. Bear in mind, Madam President, that this survey covers some 3,000 firms of various sizes. So it is a reasonable indicator of what business in Australia is feeling at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is pleasing is that the survey is demonstrating that businesses are now more confident about their performance and their future. That is not surprising, because of the economic reforms that have been put into place; in particular, our willingness to cut expenditure to keep pressure off interest rates and the industrial relations changes we have made&mdash;all changes that help Australian businesses. Also, of course, they will now have more reason to be confident because of the small business reform package that was announced by the government this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The survey shows us that businesses believe that their profit expectations are improving. Firms expect profits to be 7.8 per cent higher in the June quarter than in the March quarter but, more importantly, to then rise 12.2 per cent higher in the next March quarter. So that is an expectation of reasonable profits now, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but growing profits. Similarly, in relation to new capital investment, firms expect capital expenditure to rise by 3.4 per cent in the June quarter, and to continue to rise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment or employment prospects are not as good as we would like them to be. But I am pleased to note that they are expecting growth to the March quarter of next year. And at least that is positive, because one of the reasons we want business to do well is to create employment opportunities for more Australians, particularly those who missed out under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These results, Madam President, are consistent with other economic intelligence that we have had of recent times. I remind you of the national account figures, which showed continuing growth; retail sales figures, which showed as being 2.7 per cent higher in January than in December; and the business investment outlook figures, which showed that real business investment grew by 20 per cent last year. The latest survey shows that expectations remain robust and, in fact, the budget forecast for business investment has been revised upwards from 14 to 17 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking specifically at small business, there is no doubt that it continues to do it&mdash;according to these figures&mdash;tougher than large business, but again the expectations are quite reasonable. Small business expects profits to rise by 4.2 per cent in the June quarter, compared with this current March quarter. But it then expects profits to rise by 9.4 per cent in the March quarter next year&mdash;again very positive. It expects its capital spending to grow 1.3 per cent in the June quarter, but 2.9 per cent in the March quarter&mdash;again continuing to invest, continuing to grow. It also expects to be employing more during the next 12 months, so that is pleasing. Finally, it is expecting its exports to grow in the next 12 months&mdash;and that is very important for the trade accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So business is telling us that it is reasonably confident about the future and, when we look a little further into the future, it is even more confident. What that does is demonstrate that the policy reforms instituted by the new Howard government have been correct and have given business an opportunity to grow 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2521"> and employ as it was not able to under Labor&mdash;and that is good news for all Australians.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Foreman, for the question. The answer to the first part is: yes. The answer to the second part is: not in detail. The answer to the third part is: I would be surprised if 2,000 academics lost their jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just give me the opportunity, Senator Foreman, to point out that a number of people who were prophesying doom and gloom for the higher education sector are now nowhere to be found. Why is that, Senator Foreman? It is because in some of the highest level HECS charges, having shifted to a differentiated HECS last year, we find that universities&mdash;at least some, anyway&mdash;are overenrolled in some of the most expensive courses. So universities will not be losing any jobs as a consequence of what we have chosen to do. But whether they choose to restructure for other reasons is another matter. So I think that one is a debatable point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to 4,000 people vis-a-vis DAS: no, I am not aware of that; and I have not seen what the New South Wales manufacturing sector says it is going to do. I will guarantee you this, Senator Foreman: at the next election the people of Australia will judge us on what we have done to generate real jobs. They will have very clearly in their minds that, after 13 years of Labor, with the highest 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unemployment since the depression, the highest unemployment since World War II and months and months and months of youth unemployment at tragically high levels&mdash;much higher than they are now&mdash;when your government failed to do anything to address the structural inefficiencies in the economy to get rid of this ingrained stain of unemployment that your people put on the economy, the Australian people will be looking to this side of the chamber to say, `What have you done about it?'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Already there is a very impressive list of what we have done about it. For starters, when your people were in government you had years of growth and were still running deficits. Why? Because you were absolutely gutless politicians, completely incapable of facing up to the difficult decisions of putting a budget back into black. We came in and found Beazley's billions and billions of dollars worth of black hole and on this side of the chamber we have had the confidence and courage to fix that problem. Because to walk away from that problem and leave a budget in deficit when you have economic growth, is to walk away from the people who most need assistance&mdash;the people who are looking for a job or the low skilled who are most likely to lose their jobs. That is something Senator Foreman might like to reflect on before someone gives him such a question that he is prepared to ask again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can add onto fiscal restraint&mdash;which your people were never able to show&mdash;the changes to the industrial relations system. If you look at countries that have better employment records than us, you will see that inevitably the IR system comes into play. Look at what we have done with unfair dismissals and what we did only this week in relation to small business. We have only been in government one year. It took you 13 years to leave the mess how it was and in one year we have made significant changes to improve that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes. I think the electorate will judge us on what we have done and they will judge us as being a government of courage. They will see that you are still not prepared to say sorry for the shocking mess you made of it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Knowles for her question. It is very kind of her to ask me such a question. Last year, as you know, Madam President, the government took the opportunity to minimise what direct cuts to the higher education sector needed to be made to fill Beazley's black hole and actually took the savings by and large by seeking a higher contribution from students, fairly balancing the public and private benefit of a higher education, and we have certainly delivered on that promise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We took the opportunity to ensure that undergraduate places&mdash;your first chance in the higher education sector&mdash;would continue to grow. This year we are prepared to fund about 6,000 more undergraduate places than last year. There will be 10,000 more in 1998 and about 13,000 more in 1999. That represents an increase of 3.7 in undergraduate places between 1996 and 1999. It is important to underscore that because there were many on the other side who said that the changes we wanted to make would lock people out of university and it would be the end of higher education. Quite the opposite is the case. There are more undergraduate places than there were in 1996 and more people are seeking to get in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the budget included other changes. It introduced some equity into the HECS system by not charging doctors and teachers the same per annum contribution for the degree that they earn and allowing universities to charge full up-front fees to additional students in 1998. Nonetheless, it is important to note that some of the fundamentals of the higher education contribution scheme have in fact been retained. That is, no student is forced to pay an up&hyphen;front fee to attend university in Australia. If someone has a lower income, they can pay back their HECS when they start earning. No-one has to pay up front.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, as I have said, we have asked students to make a higher contribution for what they get. It does not appear at this stage that the increased contribution we are asking students to make has deterred them from enrolling in university. In fact, applications have held up well, despite a trend over recent years for some decline in response to the improving job prospects after the worst recession in Australia since the Great Depression.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not have firm data probably until September this year, but we do believe that&mdash;as I was indicating to Senator Foreman&mdash;law, which is in the highest HECS band, has been very heavily subscribed. One vice-chancellor, who was amongst the most critical publicly and privately&mdash;one of the vice-chancellors whose public and private message is always the same&mdash;and who was one of the greatest 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2523"> critics of our HECS increases, sheepishly admitted last week that his university is over enrolled. Those who were prophesying doom and gloom are now prepared to admit that some of their universities are over enrolled and in the highest HECS bands. Furthermore, he has had his first delegation from students saying to him, `Listen, sport. I am paying $5,500 a year for this', and the students are now demanding quality delivery of their courses, because it is costing them $5,500 and the student population around Australia will certainly be pushing for greater quality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I had more time I would tell Senator Knowles something about science and engineering enrolments, because there were a lot of people prophesying doom and gloom in that area as well.

Will you guarantee that the proposed allowance will be above the poverty line, so that young people are no longer told&mdash;as they are being told each day by student assistance centres&mdash;to go to the Salvation Army for food parcels?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Ferris for that question. It is true that Labor has only ever paid lip service to small business. When the Labor government took over in 1983 small business was the engine room of growth. When Labor came into government&mdash;and bear in mind that Labor is the political arm of the trade union movement&mdash;the only advantage it saw in small business was for union growth. So what did we see? We saw small business being badgered and hounded by union organisers to try to get them to increase their numbers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had Labor's unfair dismissal laws. Business found that they could not even dismiss someone caught stealing, whether from the till or from stock. In many cases thieves were rewarded and small business reacted in the only way it could, by curtailing growth and not employing people. Labor's performance on small business can only be described as absolutely deplorable. Labor cannot help itself when it comes to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A search of the Internet today provides confirmation of Labor's assessment of small business. Labor produced a list of 12 key achievements of the Hawke and Keating government. They included: the prices and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2529"> incomes accord, Mabo, the national agenda for women and the republic. You know what? There is not one mention of small business. Senator Schacht, you should be ashamed. That is why the Howard government's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More Time for Business</EMPHASIS> package received such overwhelming support from all areas. While this package restores balance to small business and eases the repressive union bias on small business employers, it addresses the need for government to help return confidence and growth to small business and thus real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key elements of the Howard government's determination to be a team player with small business is the proposal to establish the small business innovation fund. In this era of technological growth it addresses something Labor never had the vision to address&mdash;the need to assist small technology based businesses.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The fast ferry industry in Australia is the only area of sophisticated, complex manufactured goods that this country leads the world in. It is an industry that did not exist eight years ago. It is an industry that grew up under a Labor government. It is an industry that now leads the world. It grew up under a Labor government with assistance from a Labor government by a bounty introduced by a Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bounty act that the Labor government introduced was due to expire on 30 June this year. It is not true, as the minister, has said that under Labor the bounty would have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expired. What is true is that the act, with the bounty in it, would have expired. Our commitment to the industry was to continue the bounty. That was our commitment and negotiations between the industry and my colleague, the honourable Chris Schacht, the minister for construction at the time who was in charge of this sector when I was minister for industry, were in an advanced stage of completion. Had we not been defeated in the election, we would have continued the bounty. That was the situation that the industry knew. That was our commitment, and we were in an advanced state of delivering on that commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now let us look at the government. The government introduced a bill into this chamber to make sure that the bounty did conclude on 30 June, and it would not have been extended. That bill is on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> now. That bill has been amended, of course, because of subsequent events. Let us cast our minds back to what those events were. Last December, when this chamber was debating the rapacious slashing and cuts by the government to the research and development bill, this government had negotiations with the Independent senators in this place. As a consequence of those talks on that bill&mdash;this is my suspicion and I compliment him if my suspicion is right because one of those Independents, Senator Harradine, is a Tasmanian and this industry is based in Tasmania and Western Australia&mdash;the government issued a press statement saying that the bounty would be extended for six months to 31 December this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government was pushed into it. It did not want to do it. It resisted. It wanted a major money bill passed. It ended in negotiations with pressure from an Independent from Tasmania, and that is my assertion. It caved in and extended the bounty for six months. So let us not have any of this allegation that the government has done something voluntarily to help this industry. It has not. It has been made to do it by this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 16 December, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) put out a press release crowing about this, and they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2533"> named Senator Harradine and Senator Colston as having helped them to make up their minds about it. In that press release, they said that this aligns the bounty with the OECD agreement and for ship builders who are the major competitors for our industry. That is, those who are the major competitors for the Australian manufacturers. The department says in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> transcript of the estimates committee last time that they are the Europeans. It is in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. But what has happened here? Yesterday, the Prime Minister answered a question in the House in which he responded that he thought that the promise made by Ministers Costello and Moore in fact did align the bounty with the Europeans. It does not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is now clear&mdash;and it was clear to us and clear to the industry that has lobbied the government on this matter since it made its announcement&mdash;is that the bounty does not align it. The Prime Minister thought it did. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and the Treasurer made sure it did not, and it did not for this reason. The Europeans give their manufacturers a nine to 25 per cent bounty&mdash;ours is a five per cent one&mdash;and they are pinching orders out of shipyards in Australia and putting Australians out of work, and the manufacturers get theirs to the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If an order is placed this year, they get three years to build their ships. In Australia, you have to complete your ship to get the bounty by the end of the year. It is not aligned. Yesterday, the Prime Minister said he thought it was. He thought that, if it was not, he would make sure that it was aligned. It is not what his ministers did, and you cannot accept this stuff from Senator Parer today that it is what his ministers did. It is now for the Prime Minister to prevent retrenchments in Kwinana, to prevent people from going out of work in Tasmania, to deliver on his promise, and align those bounties with the OECD agreement. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation we have now is quite an extraordinary one indeed. To be absolutely frank, the Labor Party is glad that Senator Colston has gone because we do not believe that it is appropriate that Senator Colston hold such a position of trust. Given his extraordinary bookkeeping efforts in relation to his own travel allowance claims, we certainly would not want to see Senator Colston in any way responsible for the affairs of other members of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do find it interesting, to say the least, that Senator Colston gave his resignation to Mr Fahey, the Minister for Finance. I suspect that that is yet another example of Senator Colston's lack of attention to detail. It is obviously a matter for the Senate, and a resignation that needs to be appropriately dealt with by the Senate. It is up to Mr Fahey to explain how it took so long for him to communicate to you, Madam President, that he had received a letter from Senator Colston.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do point out that this is even more remarkable, given there had been a lot of discussion about this particular issue in the press. Even a minister for finance as out of touch as Mr Fahey, I think, ought to have been aware that the Senate was debating this issue and voting upon this issue.

Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The various claims made in Statements to the House and the Senate and the contents of correspondence from various Ministers to maintain the exclusion are answered as follows, the answers are from documents obtained under FIO and from public record:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) `They were never allotted for operational service', (contained in a letter from the Hon. Con Sciacca Minister for Defence Science and Personnel 1995).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) `Members of the RAN were only doing the duty for which they had enlisted', (October 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation in the Senate). This applies to all Service personnel everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) `They were in no danger', (November 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation in the Senate). They shared the same danger as all other Australian Service personnel serving in Malaya at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv) `They were not on Special Overseas Service', (in a letter from the office of The Hon. Bronwyn Bishop Minister for Defence Industry Science and Personnel to Mrs Williams of Adelaide dated October 1996). Requirement for Special Overseas Service was introduced in 1962 without retrospective conditions, therefore has no relevance to events of 1960.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move the following amendment to the motion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"but, in respect of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997, the bill be referred to the Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee for report on 14 May 1997".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A reporting date of 23 June would leave very little time for debate in the budget sittings because it is the Monday of the final week of the budget sittings, which, as senators would realise, will be a very difficult time for us all. A date prior to the budget would be far more suitable and it would still give the committee over six weeks to deliberate these very limited legislative changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important government initiative. There is a great deal of community support for it, including from young people particularly from regional Australia who understand the need for it. All around Australia it has been very clear, as the opposition has recognised by its willingness to support the measures, that Australians want this put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past we have dealt with much more complex legislation much more quickly than this. I draw senators' attention to the fact that the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill was referred to a committee on 10 October last year 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and it reported on 4 November, which is 25 days, and the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Further Budget and Other Measures) Bill was referred to a committee on 31 October and it reported on 18 November, which was 18 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those senators who have been here for a long time would remember that in the past the process was that bills were referred to committees on a Wednesday, committee hearings were held on a Friday and they reported on the next sitting day. In this case, the first Friday is Good Friday, and that is obviously not appropriate or possible. Nevertheless, the next sitting day, 14 May, is the date I have proposed in my amendment. I do believe that allows adequate time for this legislation to be examined very thoroughly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, plenty of legislation in the past was dealt with in a very much faster manner than in recent times. A reference to a legislative committee does not need to take so long. I remind the Senate again that the people of Australia want this legislation. They want the measure put in place as expeditiously as possible. They want to see the policy implemented. They will be frustrated at a Senate which looks as though it is playing games when in fact it is prepared to pass the legislation but wants to stall it. Senators who do that will have to hold themselves accountable to the young people of Australia, who in overwhelming numbers say they want the opportunity to contribute to their country to help 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2540"> maintain their confidence and their self&hyphen;esteem in the difficult task of looking for work in the current environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No good can be served at all by a late reporting date, but there is much to gain for regional Australia and for the unemployed people who live in regional Australia by an earlier reporting date so the measure can go through the chamber as soon as possible. I urge senators not to play games with the lives of young Australians. Having a shorter reporting date will not truncate the debate. Between now and 14 May the committee has plenty of opportunity to report, but the proposal of 23 June is ridiculous. It does not need to take so long. I urge senators to consider that in deciding on my amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government whip interjects. The government whip chairs the Selection of Bills Committee. Is the government whip willing to stand up in the chamber and indicate that this was not a unanimous decision of the Selection of Bills Committee? Of course he is not, because he was rolled over too, because he is weak and incompetent also. A whip worth holding their hand out for their money would not get rolled over like this, Senator Calvert.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is a situation where the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) proposes an amendment to a unanimous report of the Selection of Bills Committee&mdash;chaired by one of her own, rolling over one of her own&mdash;to refer a social security bill, a bill that she is responsible for, to the Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee. That is the situation. It is an admission from the minister's own mouth that she is not capable of handling the legislation committee stage of this particular bill. The minister is again exposed in terms of her absolute incompetence in her ministerial responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is on the same day that an amendment to the Commonwealth Services Delivery 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Agency Bill would have been carried if we had had an immediate recommittal of a vote, by leave, after Senator Harradine came into this chamber. There is no doubt about that; every senator in this chamber knows it. But, of course, the opposition was very reasonable and, I have to say, Senator Brown and Senator Woodley, who were also involved in that debate, were very reasonable, allowing Senator Harradine, by leave, to withdraw his request for a recommittal, even though an amendment would have been carried in this chamber this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the same minister who sat there, saw that, and now comes into the chamber and suggests that a unanimous report of the Selection of Bills Committee should be rolled over so that her own bill goes to a different legislation committee with a different reporting date. This bill, her own bill, is about one of the most significant issues in Australian public life today. There is no argument about that, not even from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this circumstance the Selection of Bills Committee has proposed a reporting date of 23 June to allow an adequate time for the issue of the so&hyphen;called work for the dole bill to be debated. But, no, that will be brought forward to 14 May and  dealt with by a different committee&mdash;without any consultation, I might say, with that different committee. I understand, Minister, that in fact the secretary of that committee will be overseas at the time when the committee would be holding its hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a serious proposition. This is not adequate time to deal with this issue. It is not proper process. There was never an intention to deal with Selection of Bills Committee reports this way&mdash;without referring these matters to other parties in the chamber for proper debate. This amendment should be opposed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a couple of words about this. I am not going to make excuses but I am just going to explain how the Selection of Bills Committee works. It has always worked in a very cooperative fashion with all parties. Sometimes matters come before us where we have not had all the i's dotted and the t's

But if Senator Faulkner wants to change the rules and wants to get down to tintacks, I can tell you that your deputy whip&mdash;not Senator Conroy&mdash;arrived here last night with this particular reference and put it on the table, and we were led to believe that it had been around to the appropriate ministers. It had not been. That is why this amendment was put today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to play that game, fine. Do you know how the Selection of Bills Committee works?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had an amazing admission from the Chairman of the Selection of Bills Committee that he was not doing his job, that he had not checked out things, that he had walked in here and moved a motion that he later supports an amendment to. Why didn't you reconvene the committee, Senator? Why didn't you put the minister's amendment to the committee and seek agreement? If you cannot chair these committees properly, if you are not doing your job and following through to make sure all the details are covered, give it away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing is that I was amazed to hear Senator Newman demand this timing and that this particular committee do it because the Australian people were demanding it. They were dead silent on this issue, other than one or two comments before the election&mdash;and the one or two comments before the election went to deny that they would ever embrace such a scheme. So do not come in here and say that the Australian people are demanding it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have had more respect for Senator Newman if she had just come in and argued on the timing of this and related it properly back to the legislative program. People could have agreed on a date of somewhere between 14 May and 23 June. But of course the whole reason for this has nothing to do with dates. This is shifting it from one reference committee to another, because the responsible minister has to take something through a reference committee. And guess what happens if Senator Newman's amendment gets up today? This matter shuffles out of the social security area and into Senator Vanstone's area&mdash;someone who is more capable of shepherding it through; someone who actually understands, occasionally, concepts, arguments, et cetera; someone who does not sit there like a piece of blancmange waiting for the department secretary to rationalise and put forward every possible argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply suggest to Senator Calvert and everyone else that this place does work by commonsense. Pull this off the floor now, go back and reconvene your meeting and see whether you can come up with a decent compromise as to which committee and which date. Why slog it out here in a meaningless way? If it is such a good committee that works on such a good basis, surely Senator Calvert can convene a meeting in the next hour. People can sit around the table and they might come up with a compromise that is workable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But at the moment all we have got is an ambush: a minister coming in and ambushing the chairman of the committee from her own side and saying, `What he signed up for is no good.' All he can give is the Nuremberg defence or some other defence: `I didn't really understand what was happening. I did not actually check the details. I've been conned.' I do not know which of those explanations is acceptable, but I can say this: wasting the Senate's time on this, when it is a 10-yard walk to a committee room to sort this issue out, seems stupid.</PARA></SPEECH>

As Senator Margetts and Senator Lees would know, these are issues about which the government is to make decisions. The fact is that, if this committee wants its deliberations, its inquiries and its conclusions to have any influence on government decisions, obviously the report must be tabled prior to those decisions being made. Therefore, in those discussions with the relevant people in the government, it became clear that 15 May was an appropriate reporting date, and that is what I have moved.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This motion calls upon the Senate to provide copies of the TA forms that were the basis for Senator Colston's claims for payment of travel allowance. These forms indicate, I believe, that he personally has signed for those particular claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Senator Colston's response to the two Senate reports that were tabled in this parliament two days ago, he made a number of points in defence of his claim that these matters were all questions of administrative error. They were bookkeeping errors, I believe he suggested. He said to the Senate by way of the tabled statements that he took information from his staff and on a regular basis filled in his TA forms. The response states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would regularly ask my office manager at the time for the dates of my travelling to place on my claims and I would transcribe those dates onto the claim form. In doing so I assumed that the dates which were given to me by my office manager were correct.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the course of my investigation, I discovered that in numerous cases these dates were not correct.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He makes the proposition that he personally filled in these claims and, secondly, that on a regular basis he received information which he later found was incorrect. What we would like to see is in fact whether or not it was he who personally filled in those forms and, secondly, the dates on which those claims were actually made. I believe it would be a reasonable basis for this Senate to examine those claims based on the proximity of the actual travel that was claimed to the point at which he submitted those claims. If he filled in those claims at the end of a particular week in which that travel was undertaken it would be a reasonable proposition to put that he would have some recollection of what actual travel did occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that in the context of the other statements that have been made by Senator Colston in his defence. He says that he was a senator here who actually kept boarding passes to aircraft. He was a man who had records of such detail that he could ascertain which aircraft he travelled on by the boarding passes that he himself had collected. He also said in these documents that he would have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to check the various other records that were made available to him&mdash;on the basis of DAS monthly reports and of course his own detailed knowledge of those particular events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know, and I think all senators here would appreciate, Senator Colston's particular expertise when it came to the issue of claims being made for travel allowance. It was understood, as he himself says in his defence and on the public record has stated, that he checked claims made with Senate staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only do we have his own expertise to measure what now appears to be his administrative errors but we also have the expertise available through the Senate staff, which he himself says he checked. This is a man who was meticulous in his record&hyphen;keeping, he says, to the extent that he kept boarding passes of air travel. I also suggest to the Senate that this is a senator whose travel records have disappeared from the transport office. It is an extraordinary proposition. On 27 February it was reported by the AAP that his travel records disappeared from the transport office.</PARA>

We object to this final report being delayed in this way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also say that the Senate has a vital interest in this matter. The matters that are subject to these two departmental briefs not only are of interest to all senators but also I think there is enormous public interest in them. Accordingly, we are seeking access to them. That is not unusual for the Senate. It is not unusual at all. But what is unusual is the extent to which this government has gone to cover up this and a number of other issues. We have seen cover-up after cover-up after cover-up.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, I do acknowledge in your case that, for example, today your willingness to table the letter you sent to Mr Williams is a different approach to ministers in the government. I acknowledge it. I think it is proper. I thank you for it. It was interesting to see that in your letter to Mr Williams you have sought access from Mr Williams to the Chief General Counsel of the Commonwealth for advice on whether the matter should be referred to the Australian Federal Police. I appreciate the fact that you have tabled that letter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also appreciate the fact that you have tabled the clerk's advice to you. I draw the attention of honourable senators and others in the building who are interested to the advice that has been presented to you by the Clerk of the Senate on Senator Colston's travelling allowance. I acknowledge that that has been tabled as a result of a question I asked, but it is an appropriate course of action for you to undertake and it would be appropriate for other ministers in the government to exercise their responsibilities in a similar way. There has to be transparency in these sorts of issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In saying that there needs to be transparency, what this motion also does is acknowledge and accept that there is a need for confidentiality, given that these matters may be subject to an investigation and report of the Australian Federal Police. I have said publicly and in this chamber&mdash;and I will say it again today and stand by it&mdash;that we believe nothing less than a full investigation and report from the Australian Federal Police on this matter is acceptable. That is what is required. This motion is acknowledging the possible confidentiality requirements. What it says is that these briefs should be made available only to Senator Hill, Senator Kernot and me, and that the release of the briefs should be on the understanding that their contents&mdash;if they are such sensitive matters&mdash;should not be publicly disclosed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether Senator Alston has seen them but I do know that it is Senator Alston who has a case to answer. It is Senator Alston that involved himself in a sleazy political deal with Senator Colston to deliver the deputy presidency in this chamber. At the end of the day, Senator Alston and Senator Hill&mdash;at least I believe Senator Hill is ashamed of what he did, Senator Alston, but both of you acted as agents for Mr Howard in this&mdash;it is the Liberal government and senior ministers in it who have a case to answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also make the point that this is the same crew that rode into government on a white charger, talking about parliamentary standards, ministerial accountability, open government and raising the standards of this parliament&mdash;the same mob. And you, Senator Alston and Senator Hill, are two ministers responsible for one of the sleaziest, lowest, most contemptible buy&hyphen;offs in Australian political history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say again that the demand that is made in this motion is reasonable. It takes account of privacy and confidentiality if needs be and, given the extent and the nature of the allegations that surround Senator Colston, it is one that I believe the Senate should endorse. We are sick and tired, in relation to this issue, of the sorts of cover&hyphen;ups we have seen from the government. They were even attempted earlier today in relation to Senator Colston's membership. When others in the government knew apparently that he had resigned, they even kept attempting day after day to try to protect Senator Colston's position there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You really need to get your act together on these sorts of issues. This is a cover&hyphen;up that is not acceptable. We will continue to delve to get to the bottom of it, to ensure that these issues are on the table. I urge decent senators to think about these issues and the sorts of claims and speeches that were made time and again by members of the Liberal and National parties, when they were in opposition, about the need for this sort of information to be

<PARA STYLE="Para">The motion calls for a further inquiry into Senator Colston's actions in regard to certain claims made, and certain behaviour in the use of parliamentary entitlements. The issue is one of some urgency as far as this parliament is concerned, because I think it would now be conceded in all quarters that the concerns raised about the misuse of these travel entitlements present us with a stench that hangs right over this parliament. It was produced as a result of the demonstrable, repeated and habitual abuse of parliamentary entitlements and it is a stench which now hangs right over the frontbench of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite an extraordinary proposition to suggest that these issues can be simply passed away by the notion that there has been an administrative error. There are 43 occasions that have now been clearly demonstrated for which a travel allowance has been paid which should not have been paid. It has been acknowledged as such by the senator concerned. These are issues which are being presented in the press of this country&mdash;not by the opposition, but in editorial comment across this country&mdash;in a way which goes very much to the heart of the level of trust and honesty that can be expected by the Australian people of this government itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a view very aptly presented in the editorial in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Coalition's Colston ploy now hangs as a bad smell over the Prime Minister and his team.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a smell that unfortunately reflects upon the entire parliament, because all this goes to the issue of probity and public accountability. It goes to questions of very basic issues of fraud which ought to be removed and ought to be resolved quickly and in a manner which ensures that this parliament's integrity is protected. It goes to the very basic issues of the way in which this government does business. It goes to the basic question of the manner in which majorities have actually 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been put together to ensure a legislative program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Clerk of the Senate has advised us by letter of the very basic issue of the fraud control plan of this chamber. This plan, which we have been made only too well aware of by way of the letter from the Clerk dated 25 March:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . imposes upon the Clerk of the Senate the responsibility to "promptly examine instances of suspected fraud to determine whether a basis exists for further action", and "on the basis of the information supplied, determine whether the alleged fraud:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. is without foundation;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. should be the subject of advice from the AFP/DPP on whether an offence has been committed;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. is a matter for departmental action, ie, disciplinary, civil or administrative proceedings to recover any monies lost to the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. is a serious matter for prompt referral to the Australian Federal Police for investigation."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The plan covers all matters concerned with the responsibility of this department. This motion is squarely aimed at that responsibility. It is incumbent upon this government to come clean on these issues because what is becoming increasingly obvious is that this government is facing a very sobering experience&mdash;as Senator Colston said&mdash;of having been caught. But it is not Senator Colston that is suffering from this sobering experience. It is the government that is suffering the hangover that results from this shoddy action. We have seen in recent times this parliament voting to suppress reports, to hide and delay investigations and to put things off to the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams)&mdash;I have been quite concerned about this&mdash;in an attempt to bury this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the manner in which there has now arisen the extent to which not only Senator Colston but also Senator Hill, Senator Alston and Mr Howard are in the gun. There is also the extent to which Senator Hill, Senator Alston and Mr Howard are owned by Senator Colston, just as he is owned by them. From the complicated web that is now emerging, it is apparent that this government is increasingly becoming enmeshed in this scandal. It is incumbent upon you, members 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2555"> of the government, to come clean and to fulfil your obligation to the Australian people and this parliament and make sure that this scandal is exposed and that these matters are clearly put right.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy President, this is a fairly familiar track that we are passing along today. We seem to have heard this debate once or twice before in the last week or so. I must say that I presumed that if it was to be brought on a third time there would be something new put before the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there does not seem to be anything new at all. It is a rehash of what is now very familiar, plus an attempt by the Labor Party to cast the net even wider. One could be forgiven for believing that Senator Colston, during these years of alleged misbehaviour, was under the authority of somebody or some party other than the Australian Labor Party. This is the most extraordinary aspect of this matter: that the Labor Party, in its efforts to persecute a former colleague because he left its midst, intends to explore his behaviour in the years in which he was one of its own and at a time over which it had jurisdiction for the responsibilities that he is now alleged to have breached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet during all these years&mdash;and today Senator Carr seeks to extend it back to 1990&mdash;Labor were in government. Labor had the ministry of Administrative Services and a Labor president sat in the chair. For all these years of Labor control there was not a sound, there was not a whisper, of alleged misconduct. But as soon as Senator Colston leaves their midst and as soon as Labor acknowledge that they are on a path of punishment, it becomes the principal issue on the Labor Party table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising that the Australian people seem to be, through the opinion polls, demonstrating a disappointment with the Australian Labor Party, which have not learnt the lessons of the last election&mdash;that, as a future 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> alternative government, it is time they concentrated on the big picture and on the tasks of rebuilding their credibility, of building policies for forthcoming elections and of presenting themselves as an alternative government. But we hear nothing of that. The principal interest of the Australian Labor Party, as demonstrated in the Senate over the last few weeks, has simply been payback&mdash;payback against Senator Colston and payback by alleging misconduct. If they had any interest at all in these matters, they would have taken action years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what is the difference now? There are two differences. Firstly, he left the Labor Party and he has to be punished for that. Secondly, they are now in opposition and it does not matter. It is good sport, apparently; you can amuse yourself with the politics of payback without believing it has any consequence.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because I had no idea Senator Colston was making fraudulent claims, and I am telling the truth. If you go to the estimates committee transcript, Senator Hill, you will see that I asked one question about one day of travel allowance; so I did not know. From that one question, apparently, we had the knock&hyphen;on effect of all those discoveries that I had no idea about. The Senate department went off and investigated one claim that I made by way of a vague allegation. What they came back with were two reports and a confession from Senator Colston to a third lot of activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us see how they got that particular information. They crosschecked the Canberra claims going back 3&half; years and they came up with 23 different nights that were not accounted for. They checked a very narrow range of interstate claims&mdash;only six months&mdash;and they found 12 nights, I think. When DAS caught Senator Colston misusing his Commonwealth car in Brisbane and told him the dates, he himself crosschecked those with his travel allowance claims down here and fessed up to another eight. What we have not had checked are the three years prior to July 1993 or all of the interstate claims&mdash;other than six months&mdash;from 1990 to 1997.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You do not know what the explanation is. It could be, as far as Senator Collins alleges, systematic fraud. But you do not want to know. You want to see nothing, hear nothing, look at nothing. You do not want the Senate department to check those areas they have not previously checked, because you are afraid of what they will find. You are afraid that the 43 nights may escalate into 60, 70, 80 or 90 nights incorrectly claimed. That is what you are afraid of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion simply asks the Senate department to check these other areas back to 1990. Clearly, if they find a pattern of fraud there, then they are going to have to go back beyond that. But do not come in here and say that we all knew; we did not. Full figures were not published until 11 September 1996. So they could not be checked. I am sure that they were not made available on a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis to the then President of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The absolute stinginess of this! When you add up the amounts of money for the nights that Senator Colston has misclaimed, you will find that he is even $5 short on those figures; he cannot even repay the full amount. He has to jib the Collector of Public Moneys by another $5. Of course, as we pointed out earlier today, the Senate will not demand that he pay interest on what were effectively interest&hyphen;free loans for 3&half; years and less. If you do not pay the amount, the old tax department will soon put an interest rate on you. So will Social Security. But not this particular chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion should go through. It should not have to be passed as a bipartisan resolution, because it simply asks the Senate department to go and check more extensively than it has in the past.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2557">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the fact that that department has found 43 errors in Senator Colston's favour and has yet to discover one error against him, one would presume that it should look at these other fields. If it does not turn anything up, there is no harm done to the Senate or Senator Colston. If it does, it would be interesting to know whether the staff member who has taken the fall was responsible for claims prior to 1993 going wrong, because it is my understanding that she was not working as office manager for three of those years&mdash;and that would be very revealing indeed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what this motion is about is filling the gaps. We can quite rightly ask, on behalf of the Australian taxpayer, what Senator Colston was doing in relation to his taxpayer funded trips and travelling allowance prior to 1993. Perhaps the government presumes that, because Senator Colston has not forwarded 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> further moneys in repayment to the Department of Administrative Services, no other `mistakes' or `infringements'&mdash;as they are described&mdash;whether they be accidental or otherwise, occurred.

This is a man we are talking about who has had enough time on his hands to identify the cheapest sandwich available in Parliament House, and we are expected to believe that this same individual has not had enough time over the last four years to check his own bookkeeping. Come on. Who do you think you are kidding? I will tell you who you are not kidding: you are not kidding us and you are not kidding the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are saying here is that we call on the Senate President to authorise an investigation into Senator Colston's travelling allowances from 1 January 1990 to July 1993 to make sure the question of Senator Colston's records is properly covered. We have requested that all travel allowance payments&mdash;DAS airfare and car hire records&mdash;be completed back to 1 January 1990. Only records between June 1993 and December 1993 have been reconciled and are currently available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This goes to the heart of the narrow scope of the second Senate report. It looked at six months worth of claims other than Canberra and it recouped from Senator Colston $3,065. Why is the government not willing to ask or direct the Department of the Senate to look at all the other trips between 1990 and 1997 and reconcile them? The principle that the government works on, Senator Hill and Senator Alston, is this: out of sight, out of mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is logical, in our view, that an examination must be made by the Department of the Senate and the Department of Administrative Services of all travel allowance records to determine whether Senator Colston was in Canberra at the time of those claims. We argue, and I think we can argue very forcefully on this, that nothing less will be acceptable to the Australian public. If their money had been used wrongly, whether by misfortune, administrative error in Senator Colston's office or otherwise, it should be paid back, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2559"> and we say paid back with interest. We believe that this has been, as I have said before in this place, deliberate and systematic abuse of Senator Colston's travelling allowance entitlements. We believe that if further infringements are found along with the ones we already know about then they certainly should be placed in the hands of the Australian Federal Police.

Until he achieves his final result of hounding Senator Colston out of this chamber, he will not be satisfied. I do not question your motives, Senator Collins, because you have shown in the past that revenge is not one of your motives. I never once suggested that your position was one of revenge. I would not say that, but Senator Ray has said that, as has Senator Carr in the speeches that he has made here today. He has made it quite obvious that he is determined to take this revenge on one of his former colleagues. He has made it quite clear from what he has said in the chamber that that is his motive. Anything that has been said here today only proves that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I am not motivated in any sense by revenge in respect of anything I have said about Senator Colston. I wish to make it clear, because I was accused of the contrary. I personally did not know about these claims. I found out about them only when they were published.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that I was motivated was not by revenge, as Senator Alston suggested, I was motivated by simply this: I had the privilege of chairing the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, between 1987 and 1990, for over two years. I am intimately familiar with the workload of the chair of that committee. I would hope that the staff of the committee, and that was principally Peter O'Keeffe, would be prepared to attest to the fact&mdash;if they were questioned by the Federal Police, and I think they should be, in terms of the workload required of the chair&mdash;that I was as competent a chair of that committee as any other.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have pleasure in presenting this first report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee Inquiry into the Australian Legal Aid System.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry into the Legal Aid System in Australia was referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee on 17 September 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The terms of reference for the inquiry are extensive and cover many issues of great importance to the provision of legal aid in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee has received 157 written submissions, many of which are very comprehensive, and has held eight public hearings around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At these hearings the committee has received evidence from 134 witnesses from a diverse and impressive range of backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the committee reviewed the evidence and submissions, it became evident that there is a great deal of concern and confusion about the uncertain future of legal aid arrangements in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, our inquiry into legal aid has found that all stakeholders are currently preoccupied with the consequences of change in the legal aid system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee set out to examine the terms of reference systematically but found itself caught up in a storm of anxiety, the eye of which is the Commonwealth Government's decision: 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2564">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&bull;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to reduce the global budget for legal aid,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&bull;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to terminate legal aid agreements with the states and territories, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&bull;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to renegotiate funding according to different and more limited parameters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to coming to Government, the Coalition had promised to support legal aid at pre-election levels. The committee has heard many witnesses describe their disappointment with the Government's backdown since its election in March 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee has received excellently researched and compelling evidence from many distinguished witnesses including State and Territory Attorneys-General, the Law Council of Australia and the State and Territory Law Societies and Bar Associations, members of the Judiciary and academics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee has heard that Australia has built a national legal aid system which is recognised internationally as an excellent model.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This model, referred to as a "mixed model", brings together the energy and goodwill of the private profession, the legal aid commissions, and the community sector working together cooperatively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although there are separate legal aid commissions in each of the eight (8) states and territories, plus about one hundred and fifty (150) community legal centres, these agencies, and the profession, work together to contribute to a truly cooperative national system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The model provides a mix of services ranging from representation in court where this is necessary, but it also includes providing minor legal assistance, advice and legal education so that many people are able to help themselves solve their legal problems before these get out of hand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's legal aid system, with this level of cooperation, and the extent of services provided, is the envy of many countries. The parties who contribute to the current Australian legal aid system are justifiably proud of it. They are anxious to preserve it and to build on it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee heard, however, that the current legal aid system has one major and fundamental downfall. That is, that it is "mean", because it does not have sufficient resources to extend it to many people who need it or would benefit from it. Indeed, many witnesses told the committee that the system is far from being a "Rolls Royce" system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee also heard evidence from experienced practitioners and from community organisations representing the perspectives of a range of constituents with special needs. Some witnesses told of the degree of vulnerability of their clients in an already over-stretched, and some say, underfunded legal aid system. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Witnesses want to further improve the system, not watch it fall apart. Witnesses are worried about who else will miss out on access to services and assistance in the future, when, already scarce, resources are radically cut back.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The strength of feeling about this is such that the committee decided to prepare this first report concentrating on the current situation. The committee considered that it was important to do this in advance of the 1997-98 Budget due for delivery in May.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee considered that, by presenting the evidence provided to it date in a report to the Parliament, the Government may be better equipped to understand the degree and nature of concern about Commonwealth legal aid expenditure reductions and policy refocusing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many witnesses believe that the Government has acted in too much haste in relation to legal aid in its effort to implement a deficit reduction strategy. Small initial savings could lead to far greater economic and social costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Peter Short, President of the Law Council of Australia said the following to the committee, and I think this sums up the views of many:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Law Council and, I think, society as a whole generally accept that a government should balance its budget and has to reach priorities. In a nutshell we are saying that, by cutting legal aid, the government has reached a wrong priority. We say that in any civilised society equality before the law is one of the hallmarks of successful government. Equality before the law means that people who are attacked or under threat by a legal system must feel comfortable that society is providing them with an equal opportunity to answer and relieve themselves of that burden. It is a positive obligation of a civilised society to provide that minimum level of legal assistance."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee has been very impressed with the extent of commitment nationally, to the preservation, and further development, of a viable legal aid system in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is significant support for such a system, for example, from governments, the legal profession, academia, the churches and the social services sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a great deal of expertise in legal aid and the broader justice system being willingly offered to Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee has recommended that the Government consider establishing a high level representative task force to advise Governments on the legal aid system and its place in Australia's justice system.  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2565">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence to the committee suggests that such a representative expert group would receive support from the Law Council of Australia and national legal aid organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee is concerned about the uncertain future of Australia's current cooperative legal aid system. The committee intends to continue to gather evidence addressing each of the terms of reference and to take the opportunity to test and further develop this evidence at future public hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee's continued inquiry will contribute to public debate and awareness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee agrees with those witnesses who have told it that legal aid issues ought to be considered alongside broader issues in the justice system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For this reason it will undertake the current legal aid inquiry as part of its wider responsibility to inquire into the continuing ability of all Australians to have access to litigation and legal services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee's intention in tabling this initial report is to ensure that the input of the many persons and organisations who provided the committee with evidence is available to the Parliament and can be taken into consideration by the Government prior to its delivery of the 1997/98 budget on 13 May 1997.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a damning report, and it is important to point out to the Senate that it is a unanimous report. There is no 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dissent from this report. It is an agreed report by all members&mdash;government and opposition&mdash;of this very sorry story that is outlined in the report. I commend the report to anyone with an interest in aviation safety in Australia. It condemns the Minister for Transport (Mr Sharp) but it damns the minister's hand&hyphen;picked chairman, Mr Forsyth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report tells a very sorry story indeed, and it is an unfortunate chapter in what has been a long history involving the use of this rescue equipment. During the time available to me, I do not think that I can do much more than to point anyone with an interest in aviation safety to the relevant sections of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make it clear&mdash;as the report itself does&mdash;that the involvement of the minister and his adviser in this went to the extent of involving themselves in discussions with Mr Gruzman on the equipment. Subsequently, on request from the new chairman, Mr Forsyth, they were involved in directing, in writing, a fly&hyphen;off, as it was called&mdash;or a testing program&mdash;to test this equipment against the rescue equipment that Airservices Australia was already using.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Airservices Australia and the Royal Australian Air Force recently performed in an exemplary fashion in completing one of the greatest sea rescues of all time. That rescue was performed without using the PADS equipment, and there is a good reason for that. Having spent well over $1 million&mdash;and by the time this sorry story is finished it will probably be closer to $2 million&mdash;on the PADS equipment in what the report says was a very precipitate fashion, the equipment is currently unusable. It is lying idle in a warehouse in Melbourne and has had its certification formally withdrawn by CASA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer all honourable senators and, indeed, everyone else, to page xii where the report says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The precipitous action of the new Chairman of the Airservices Australia Board in instigating an evaluation of search and rescue systems, and his haste in accepting the results of that evaluation, ignored a long history of considered deliberation on the PADS system in that very organisation, and a clear and very recent decision to reject any move 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2566"> to replace or augment the existing system with PADS equipment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister&mdash;as the report points out&mdash;also ignored a detailed brief that had been given to him in April, which laid out the full sorry history of this saga and the firm decision that Airservices Australia had made not to purchase PADS equipment because it posed a danger to the lives of the crews that were using it&mdash;that is, the rescue crews. The reason I point that out is that the minister, in interview after interview&mdash;right up until the last interview he gave on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> &mdash;kept saying, `PADS is more accurate.' As the report points out, the committee has no dispute with that. The accuracy of the equipment is not in dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that there are serious problems at the other end of this equipment that directly potentially endanger the lives of the rescue crews themselves. For the board and the chairman to take the action they did is&mdash;I quote the relevant paragraph on the same page:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concludes that because the Chairman requested from the Board, and received, authorisation to proceed unchecked, he must accept full responsibility for a decision that resulted in the expenditure of over $1 million on equipment that is currently unusable. The Chairman, in making his decision, placed too much emphasis on accuracy of the delivery system and insufficient emphasis on the safety of the crew involved in the delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For these reasons, the Committee concludes that the actions of both the Board and the Chairman were imprudent to the point of negligence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a hard finding, and a unanimous finding, of the committee. But it was an inescapable finding, unfortunately&mdash;I say that word `unfortunately' advisedly; I mean it&mdash;because the evidence given to the committee was overwhelming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new chairman was appointed by the minister. I have to say all oppositions are in the position for quite a while&mdash;particularly when the current opposition was in government for 13 years&mdash;of being able to blame the previous government for all its sins and omissions. But, as the report makes clear, this situation is absolutely laid at the feet of this new minister. This is his chairman we are talking about; the person he appointed with a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> great deal of fanfare. Why do I mention that? Obviously because the minister has been running a campaign&mdash;a foolish and reckless one, in my view&mdash;against the chairman of CASA, the air safety authority, claiming that the chairman is incompetent, the board is incompetent, and, because of the minister's concern about air safety, he wants to replace the chair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No evidence has actually been produced to justify those attacks on Mr Justice Fisher. In fact, to take one example of just how reckless the minister's accusations have been, to justify dismissal of the board of CASA he accused them of dereliction of duty because they had not prosecuted the people responsible for the DC3 incident. In fact, as was demonstrated within 24 hours, it has never been the responsibility of CASA or its predecessor, the CAA, to prosecute anyone; it is the responsibility of the Director of Public Prosecutions. CASA acted with perfect propriety in forwarding everything they needed to forward to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who has taken a decision not to prosecute in the public interest. But this a relevant matter because this minister has set the standard for himself on this. This minister has said that, if there is proven incompetence on the part of a chairman of any board involving safety, they should go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This unanimous report, this all party report, finds that the chairman of Airservices Australia was imprudent to the point of negligence in this matter&mdash;this is the chair appointed by the minister. It also criticises&mdash;I think justifiably, to some extent&mdash;the board. But of course there are mitigating circumstances, of which all committee members are aware, that need to be stated. It was the chairman's first meeting as chairman when this proposition was put. The board, I suppose, felt, `Well, this is the new broom.' In fact, the new chair told us that he had laid down his philosophy to the new board as to how he was going to conduct matters. He summed it up for us in what I thought were extraordinary words: that his experience as a chairman&mdash;of Dymocks books, as it happens&mdash;and his experience in business had led him to the view that `if a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2567"> thing was worth doing, it was worth doing as quickly as possible'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That, I have no doubt, is the appropriate philosophy for Dymocks books. Unfortunately, it is not the appropriate philosophy for the chairman of a government statutory authority whose primary statutory responsibility is the safety of the Air Navigation Act. This is particularly so when the chairman had at his disposal numerous reports, one of them from the Royal Australian Air Force, that laid out in detail that this equipment posed a risk to the lives of the crews that were using it. He gave extraordinary evidence to the committee that, although he had seen the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> report on PADS, which provoked him into going to his first board meeting and asking for carte blanche to buy it, he had deliberately not read any of the previous reports so that he was unbiased. He had absolutely no standard against which to check the accuracy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is extraordinary stuff. In the 10 minutes I have got left I do not have time to go over it, but I say again: anyone with an interest in air safety has got an obligation to read this report because it has damned this chairman. I take no pleasure in saying that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to your laugh, Senator Parer, have a look at the public record.

It is not something that I delight in doing. Read the report, Senator Parer, if you do not think this is justified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This new chairman went to the board meeting and, as we say in this report, said, `Give me power of attorney to do this myself without any further recourse to the board.' And they did! Therefore, the new chairman, having wanted to take full responsibility, now has to take full responsibility for the mess this has turned into and the fact that over $1 million has been spent on equipment which currently cannot be used, equipment which during its testing further placed the lives of aircrews in danger, as we all know. It is now up to the minister to determine whether he is

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(6.05 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some brief comments on the report by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee into the purchase of the precision aerial delivery system, PADS, by Airservices Australia. I do not disagree with most of what Senator Bob Collins has said about what is in this report. In particular, I want to emphasise the exoneration of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) for in his involvement in this particular process. That is dealt with in two chapters of the report and also in the findings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no question that the findings of this committee, as Senator Bob Collins said, are very harsh on the board and the chairman. That is a matter that the minister will have to deal with. In the couple of minutes I have&mdash;I know business must move on&mdash;I would like to briefly highlight that there was nothing forthcoming from Senator Bob Collins. Hopefully something might be forthcoming from the shadow minister for transport, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), in the other place in terms of the campaign that they carried out with regard to Minister Sharp while this hearing was going on. I quote a particular question that was asked of Senator Alston by Senator Bob Collins:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . his understanding was that the minister had approved both the re&hyphen;evaluation of the equipment and its subsequent purchase? Are you also aware that the committee was given a letter by the senior adviser to the minister, Mr Wallis, which clearly indicates the extent that both he and his minister were involved in the matter? In the face of this evidence, it is clear, minister, that Minister Sharp has caused you to mislead the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a very serious claim from Senator Collins. It was done on half information. I believe that Senator Collins and the shadow minister, Mr Tanner, from the other place owe Minister Sharp an apology for the way they picked up a half truth and ran with a particular aspect of this case. As we got all the evidence and all the information on the table for this report, it became quite clear that this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2568"> claim, this charge, this press campaign, was being run on a false premise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, at that time&mdash;and this will be shown in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Senator Collins himself questioned the accuracy of the evidence being put forward before the committee by Mr Forsyth. He questioned it himself, yet that did not stop him running this particular campaign. I call on both those gentlemen to do the honourable thing and recognise the fact that they were using half information, running a campaign on a false premise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will leave my comments at that. I re-emphasise, firstly, that the minister and his adviser were exonerated. They only got involved when they were asked to get involved to confirm a couple of aspects of it, which I would determine normal ministerial behaviour. Secondly, it was most disappointing to me as a member of that committee to find out the processes that were gone through. Hopefully, lessons can be learned for other government instrumentalities so we do not see an occurrence such as this again.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond firstly to Senator Crane's comments and then go to the substance of the report. I do not think Senator Crane can stand there straight faced and say that the only involvement the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) had was being dragged in by Mr Gruzman. If you have a look at the facts, Senator Crane, it is clear that when Mr Forsyth wrote to the minister about wanting the fly&hyphen;off, the minister authorised the fly&hyphen;off, ignoring his own departmental advice, ignoring previous advice from Airservices about the dangers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An extensive briefing was given to the committee, so it is impossible to say, `Oh, we do not think PADS is a particularly good system.' An extensive briefing based on extensive testing by the RAAF, the department and everybody else who had been involved in it was: `This system is a dud because it is not safe. Yes, it hits the target but in hitting the target it is potentially causing a life threatening situation to the crew in the aircraft delivering it.'</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CRANE" NAMEID="UW4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator Crane</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That's all in the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3L6">Senator CONROY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was all in the report before the minister but he ignored it. It was there before we did our report. It did not need this report to reiterate that PADS is not safe to the crews delivering it. It was there in black and white from the RAAF and a host of other sources before our report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will then go through the farce of what happened in the training and the evaluation. We had a situation of some rescues in January, which all senators would be aware of. The minister came out in response to Mr Gruzman and said, `There's nothing wrong with PADS. It is just a training problem. The crews have not been trained properly.' Still the minister is refusing to accept all the evidence put before him and before the evaluation panel and the cancelling of the training that took place in November because it was again shown to be unsafe. The minister has consistently ignored all the evidence that has been before him. So he has not simply supported the purchase and the fly&hyphen;off and been dragged into it; he has chosen to ignore all the expert advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In coming back to the substance of the report, Senator Collins made a number of references. The chairman of Airservices, Mr Forsyth, walked into his first meeting, after watching <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS>, and decided with no briefings, no requests for information, no what do other people think: `I want to organise this. I want to clear this up.' Information was available from Airservices if he had chosen to ask.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He had been briefed but he told the committee the briefing was not satisfactory. But when asked by the committee: `What was it that you found unsatisfactory in the briefing from Airservices?' he could not remember. He then went on to praise the staff of Airservices six months later, saying that they were a very professional organisation. At the time he said that their briefing was unsatisfactory but could not remember why. So he wrote to the minister for permission. As I said, the minister ignored all the evidence and advice from his own departmental briefings and said, `Go ahead. Order the fly&hyphen;off.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So then we move to the fly&hyphen;off, and the evidence before the committee on the conduct 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2569"> of the evaluation panel is damning. Read the report. You have an RAAF report, scientific testing conducted 12 months before, that states, `This is unsafe for the following reasons . . . These must be addressed before there is further evaluation, further testing, of PADS.' This information was presented to the evaluation panel, according to evidence given to the committee, before the evaluation tests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When appearing before the committee, the evaluation panel was asked: what evidence did the manufacturer provide to you of the changes that he had made to models D to E that satisfy and fix the issues raised in the RAAF report? The evidence went from extraordinary to bizarre. We were told that no, there had been no independent testing by someone else on the manufacturing design. Mr Gruzman had thrown the PADS units on the back of a truck and driven it down a bumpy road to simulate stormy conditions in a plane at 100 feet, among air turbulence.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ha, ha!</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3L6">Senator CONROY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You can laugh, Senator Hogg, but that is actually the evidence that the evaluation panel took. The manufacturer said, `I put it on the back of a truck and drove it over a bumpy road to simulate air turbulence,' and they accepted that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Should you just accept the word of a manufacturer of a product that a safety problem had been fixed? When asked, `Would you accept as satisfactory evidence before a committee from a manufacturer?', the chair simply said, `I fixed it.' The committee asked the chair, Mr Forsyth, `Would you agree that it is acceptable to take the word of the manufacturer in this circumstance?' Mr Forsyth's answer was, `I'm not qualified to say.' Senators are laughing at that. But Mr Forsyth's response was, `I'm not qualified to say.' He used the back of a truck to simulate stormy conditions in a life&hyphen;threatening situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then received evidence from the pilot who was actually trying to conduct the evaluation.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="HOGG" NAMEID="7L6">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7L6">Senator Hogg</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Was he in the truck?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3L6">Senator CONROY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, the pilot was not in the truck, Senator Hogg. He was even more 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> damning before the evaluation committee about what a joke it was. We have here a product designed to save lives. They conducted an evaluation in sunny, still conditions. Most operations to save lives at sea are conducted in stormy weather.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would have thought that the panel conducting a test on air safety equipment would seek to find rough, stormy conditions to simulate as closely as possible the conditions that you would find in a rescue. Did the panel do that? No. It looked for a day but it could not find any stormy weather. So it said, `Well, that's it; it's passed the test.' This is what happened when Mr Forsyth was asked&mdash;it is here in the report&mdash;why the panel was forced to do the tests so quickly. He was asked why they had to be finished in such a short time frame. Mr Forsyth said, `Well, if they had asked, they could have had more time.' When we asked the chief executive of Airservices why, he said, `It was necessary to do it so quickly.' But the panel itself told the committee that it felt constrained and it could have done a better job if it had had more time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a disgrace. The panel is culpable and the chair is culpable. The minister ignored all the advice. But Mr Forsyth, as he said, is not qualified to make a decision. He is not qualified for this job, and he should consider his position.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aged Care Income Testing Bill 1997 is being tabled today in advance of the Aged Care Bill 1997 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to establish an administrative procedure to support the implementation of the income testing arrangements that were part of the aged care reforms announced in the 1996 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aged Care Income Testing Bill will allow the Departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs to commence income testing residents in nursing homes and hostels so that they can be advised by my Department in advance of 1 July 1997 about the level of charges they will face when the Aged Care Bill is passed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill only enables an income assessment to be undertaken and advice to be provided to residents of the outcome of that assessment. It does not enable charges to be increased, nor does it allow any reduction in the level of Commonwealth subsidies paid under the National Health Act 1953 and the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The substantive income testing provisions which would enable increased charges and corresponding reductions in subsidies will be provided for in the Aged Care Bill 1997. It is anticipated that the Aged Care Bill will also be tabled during this sitting with a commencement date of 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions in this income testing bill would therefore cease to operate once the new aged care legislation is in force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for an exchange of information between the Department of Health and Family Services and the Departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs. The Department of Health and Family Services will provide resident information to the other two Departments who will match it to their records to retrieve information for those residents, to enable the determination of ordinary income for those residents. Information will be provided to the Department of Health and Family Services under the relevant parts of the acts administered by those Departments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are provisions in the bill to ensure that any personal information exchanged for the purpose of income testing is not used for any other purpose. These provisions have been developed in consultation with the Privacy Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The income test to be applied by the Departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs is the existing test carried out in determining entitlements to pensions and benefits. The determination of income for people already in receipt of Social Security or Veterans' Affairs pensions or benefits will therefore be based on their existing available income information and they will not have to provide additional details. People will, however, be able to request a review of the determination if their circumstances have changed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Special protections for war widows and widowers have been built into the bill so that they will not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2572"> pay any more than other people with an equivalent income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9 per cent of current nursing home and hostel residents are non-pensioners. The Department of Social Security will undertake assessments for this group in order to ensure that they can be advised of their potential income tested charge as much in advance of 1 July as possible. The Department of Social Security will require 3 months prior to 1 July to undertake the necessary assessments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The income testing provisions in the Aged Care Income Testing Bill have therefore been introduced for passage in advance of the provisions in the Aged Care Bill to provide this necessary lead time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When income testing is in operation after 1 July only those who can afford to pay a little more and make a fair contribution will be asked to do so. Older people will not be asked to pay what they cannot afford for the residential aged care services they need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People who are not satisfied with decisions made about their income will have a right of appeal, first to the relevant Department and then to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Social Security Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms announced in the 1996 Budget will see far-reaching changes to residential aged care services in Australia. The establishment of the administrative procedures provided for in this bill is essential to the Government's overall strategy of providing residents with detailed information on the reforms and with certainty about the impact on their individual situation.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">We move to disallow three regulations contained in statutory rules 1996 No. 307 which have been made under the Workplace Relations Act 1996. Each of the regulations concerns termination of employment. I must express my disappointment that at this stage of business we are dealing with these disallowance motions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It came to my attention only briefly before dealing with this matter that an arrangement had been reached between the government and the Democrats which deals with at least some of the issues pertinent to this, but of which the opposition had no knowledge. It may well have been the case&mdash;and we are yet to analyse more completely the terms of this arrangement&mdash;that it dealt with some of the issues that I will be covering now. I will deal with some of those in more detail as I reach them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regulations we seek to disallow are: regulation 5, new regulation 30BD contained in regulation 7, and new regulation 30C contained in regulation 8. Perhaps it is time also 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to highlight the other element of concern the opposition has in this matter and that is that, in relation to the government's industrial relations package, the only area where it signalled such changes to regulations was in respect of the filing fee&mdash;not some of the other areas which I am about to cover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New regulation 5 would exclude three classes of employees from making an application for relief under the unfair and unlawful termination provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. Those three classes of employees are: employees engaged under a contract of employment for a specified period of time; probationary employees where the maximum period of probation is three months or less, or is more than three months and is reasonable in the circumstances; and casual employees engaged on a regular basis for more than six months. Casual employees will now have their entitlements changed and this will now be extended to 12 months under the proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to employees engaged for a specified period of time, I note that under the existing regulations, where the contract of employment was made after 16 November 1994, these employees are excluded only if the specified period is less than six months. For contracts made before 16 November 1994, the duration of the specified period is, as in the proposed regulations, irrelevant. The reason for the difference was that the relevant regulations were amended on 16 November 1994 to introduce the necessity for a specified period of less than six months. So in effect this new regulation seeks to reverse the 1994 amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I need to cover the two important reasons why this amendment was put in in 1994. First, employers were being encouraged to employ employees on fixed term contracts of lengthy duration in order to avoid liability under unfair and unlawful termination provisions. This is dealt with in part in the government&hyphen;Democrat deal but unfortunately the dealing with it will not cover the significant concerns that we would raise. In fact, the provision in this deal, on my very limited first reading of it, seems, on our interpretation, to make a microscopic change, if anything 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2574"> hardening the provision, moving it from fixed term contracts where the main purpose is to avoid obligations to being a substantial purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reason for the original amendment was that the original regulation was inconsistent with Australia's obligations under article 3 of the ILO recommendation concerning termination of employment, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Adequate safeguards should be provided against recourse to contracts of employment for a specified period of time the aim of which is to avoid the protection resulting from the Termination of Employment Convention.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have not heard&mdash;and I do not know whether the Democrats have heard&mdash;an argument from the government that this trifling change will actually rectify the problem that we find whereby, if these regulations go through, we will be inconsistent with the ILO. It was thought that the only way to properly prevent recourse to contracts that sought to avoid the obligations was to provide that only contracts with a specified period of six months or less would be exempted. As I said, no arguments have been put to the opposition which change that. The Democrats obviously accepted these arguments back in 1994, so I will be interested to hear from the speakers following why it appears that they have accepted something different as satisfactory now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is, of course, an additional argument which does not seem to have been dealt with at all in this deal&mdash;and that is that the new regulation will effectively have retrospective operation. Employees who, after 16 November 1994, entered into a contract for a specified period of more than six months will now find themselves without access to unfair and unlawful termination provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. I do not know whether that was considered between the government and the Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us move on to some other areas. In relation to probationary employees&mdash;and none of that is in this deal&mdash;I note that the present regulations only exclude employees where the probationary period is reasonable. The effect of the new regulation is to deem that three months or less can be reasonable in every 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> case. This deeming provision is completely inconsistent with the approach that has been taken by the Industrial Relations Court of looking at what is fair and reasonable in the particular circumstances of a job. For example, in a 1994 case, Chief Justice Wilcox observed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps the most important consideration, in determining what is a fair and reasonable period, will be the nature of the job. In the case of a person employed to carry out repetitive duties under close supervision, a reasonable period may not extend beyond a week or two. In the case of a person employed in a marketing or managerial position, working with little or no direct supervision and whose quality of performance cannot be immediately apparent, it may be reasonable for an employer to specify a probationary period measured in months.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In recent times, Mr Howard has said that to him 12 months is a reasonable period. It seems Mr Howard thinks he knows more on industrial relations law than the equivalent of a Federal Court justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a very strong and very good argument as to why a discretion should remain with the commission to determine whether the probationary period is reasonable in all of the circumstances. It surprises me that the Democrats, the great upholders of the Industrial Relations Commission and its powers, have not dealt with this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regulation 5 would also permit casual employees to make an application under unfair dismissal provisions only where they have been employed on a regular and systematic basis for a period of at least 12 months. This contrasts with the present regulations, which permit casuals to make an application where they have been employed on this basis for a period of six months. This change strikes against the general understanding of what is regarded as a short period of employment. It will also encourage&mdash;much against the rhetoric of the government about part&hyphen;time employment&mdash;further casualisation of the work force as employers are encouraged to employ casuals for up to 12 months at a time in order to avoid their obligations with respect to fair and reasonable employment. This is certainly not about establishing a fair system. It seems to be establishing a loose system so 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2575"> that some employers can seek and find out rorts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to new regulation 30BD contained in regulation 7, we are dealing with a $50 filing fee. The committee which dealt with the Workplace Relations Act heard submissions on this issue. Under the existing regulation, no filing fee is payable. The government justifies the introduction of a filing fee on the basis that it will discourage unmeritorious and vexatious claims. But because a monetary sum is involved, the only claims likely to be discouraged are those of people with very little means, irrespective of the merits of their claim. It is unlikely that people with the means to pay $50 will be discouraged from vexatious claims. I note that the Democrat&hyphen;government deal deals with this issue by providing that a filing fee be refundable if it is withdrawn, but that does very little in terms of the concerns that we would have and that indeed were raised before the committee in relation to this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the new regulation 30C contained in regulation 8, this regulation would remove the prohibition on termination of an employee who is temporarily absent because of illness or injury in either of two circumstances: the employee's absence extends for more than three months, unless the employee is on paid sick leave for the duration of the absence; or the total absences of the employee within a 12&hyphen;month period extend for more than three months, unless the employee is on paid sick leave for the duration of the absence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the government&mdash;and I hope that a response will be forthcoming before we need to vote on this disallowance&mdash;a couple of questions. It is unclear in the wording in the regulation what is meant by duration. If a worker is on paid sick leave for a period of 2&half; months of a total more than three&hyphen;month period, are they covered or, because the last two weeks of that period are unpaid, could these provisions come into force?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I ask the government in relation to these provisions: what happens to employees who have cashed out paid sick leave? Is one of the consequences of them cashing it out that they will lose their eligibility to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> protection under unfair dismissal laws because they have cashed it out? Will workers be apprised of these circumstances when they are balancing up the no disadvantage in a total sense in agreements that they might reach?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present regulations do not qualify the current prohibition in the way proposed. In other words, if an employee is temporarily absent because of an illness or injury, irrespective of its duration, the employee cannot be terminated. The unfairness of this new qualification on such an important prohibition is manifest. The qualification is arbitrary. As soon as the employee has been absent for more than three months, either consecutively or cumulatively, the employee is liable to be lawfully terminated even though the illness or injury is perfectly legitimate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give the Senate some examples of what is perfectly legitimate. One analogy I personally feel is a quite good one is: if we can do this to people who are ill, why not do it to women who are pregnant? It is not the employer's responsibility if someone falls pregnant, just as it is not the employer's responsibility if someone becomes ill. So why bother giving women special consideration when their absence is beyond three months?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps an analogy that will affect more people in this place would be the one Senator Murray outlined&mdash;I apologise to him for borrowing this&mdash;relating to people who have questionable tickers, or hearts. If someone has a heart attack, because they are likely to be absent for around three months do they potentially face being lawfully terminated?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to conclude my comments at this stage by referring to my very brief analysis of the government-Democrat deal. Firstly, I want to again reinforce my disappointment. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2576"> The opposition has cooperated in relation to this disallowance on several occasions to facilitate government business. To some people's surprise, they thought we were actually considering the terms of this deal, which we have never seen. So the opposition has agreed to delay this disallowance on the basis that we want to facilitate the cause of government business, and we find ourselves at the last moment being presented with this deal, the terms of which we have had no time to give proper consideration to. But let me give my limited consideration of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On my reading of it, it includes two reviews, one note, one restatement of the current law or what is presently the case and, as I said, one microscopic change from the `main purpose' to the `substantial purpose'. There is nothing in this deal, and it has not even dealt with half of the issues that I have raised in just the brief 10 or so minutes I have had to speak because we have agreed to contain ourselves to limited time. I look forward to the response from the government and the Democrats.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3M6">Senator MURRAY</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(6.41 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, my sincere apologies to Labor. This letter was struck between the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) and me late on Sunday evening with the understanding that the workplace regulations disallowance would be running on Monday. I had understood his office had distributed it, and I presumed it was in Senator Sherry's hands. That is my understanding, but you have my apologies that I did not pursue it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor is seeking to disallow three regulations issued under the Workplace Relations Act dealing with termination of employment regulations. The first deals with those classes of employees who are excluded from protection of the unfair dismissal regime; the second deals with the application fee for lodging an unfair dismissal application; and the third deals with the circumstances under which absence from duty due to sickness ceases to become an unlawful dismissal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats advised Labor that they shared their concern about the potential scope of these provisions. These provisions, we felt, if applied in a regressive 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and nasty way, could reduce the promise of the unfair dismissal regime to provide a fair go all round. I think one of the aspects we have to be constantly aware of is that, with the Workplace Relations Act and all the workplace regulations, there are unfortunately employers and employees out there who are less than ideal in their practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I placed our concerns before the Minister for Industrial Relations, Peter Reith, and, in several meetings since those regulations were first brought to our attention by the ACTU, Minister Reith and I discussed the various problems. We finally met on Sunday night, and he agreed then to amend these regulations in several substantial respects. I understand the minister will read that correspondence into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> shortly through the parliamentary secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats' key concern with those regulations was that employers might, with regard to the specified term or the fixed term contracts as they are known, try to avoid the unfair dismissal provisions. With the introduction of Australian workplace agreements, we think that specific term or fixed term contracts will continue to grow in popularity. Where a specified term contract is a genuine specific term or fixed term contract and a person is terminated at the end of that contract in accordance with the contract, we think it is reasonable they should not then be able to challenge that as an unfair dismissal. They would have signed up for a term, they would have done that term and the contract would have ended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the issue of double jeopardy which existed with the present act; that is, if somebody was dismissed within the period of a fixed term contract, they would be able to go to the courts and be paid out for the entire unexpired portion of that contract if that contract was terminated unjustly. Under the laws, it could be interpreted that they could also get rectification from the Industrial Relations Commission. That was plainly a problem which needed to be resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where employers try to take what we think of as permanent or normal engagements and place over them a facade of a specified term contract, they should not be able to avoid the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2577"> provisions. In other words, if the intention of constructing the contract is to avoid the unfair dismissal regime, they should not be permitted to get away with that. If they terminate the employment before the contract expires or after it expires, it will no longer be a specified term contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they have had a succession of specified term contracts, one after another, then the nature of the employment really ceases to be a specified or fixed term contract and becomes a rolling contract. The amended regulation will make it clear that both these cases of contracts will not be excluded from the unfair dismissal regime. They will not be excluded in that circumstance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exclusion in 30B(2) will also be expanded to ensure that employers cannot use contracts to avoid these provisions where a substantial purpose of the engagement is to avoid the provisions. Senator Jacinta Collins, we were advised that `substantial' actually provides a greater protection than `main', and that was the advice we followed. That protection will be broader, we believe, than the protection under Labor's old regulation. Disallowance of regulation 30B, as an aside, would also have the perverse result of allowing very high income earners earning over $64,000 a year access to the provisions. I do not think that is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has raised the issue of casuals and probationary employees. These regulations are about balance and judgment. At this stage, we think the balance is probably about right in the amended regulation and we are going to leave it at that. But the minister has agreed, at our request, to review these regulations after 12 months and we will need to look at the empirical evidence then. It is our consistent opinion that we have to see how the new laws settle down before we arrive at a conclusion as to how they will operate. Casual employees will also have the protection of the wider 30B(2), where the contract of employment using casual engagement is subject to action if it has a substantial purpose of being there to avoid the unfair dismissal provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regards to the application fee, right from the start we accepted the principle of an application fee. Therefore all along the ques 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion has been about the quantum. Frankly, we were concerned with a $50 quantum. But the registrar reports that at least 50 per cent of applications for waiver of the application fee have been granted. In other words, half of the people going to the Industrial Relations Commission are not having to pay the application fee. We thought the application fee could have emerged as a major impediment to people applying for unfair dismissal. We are advised that, to date, this fear does not seem to have eventuated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it does remain early days. These laws are still coming into practice. The minister has agreed to amend the regulation to give an 18&hyphen;month sunset clause and to conduct a full review of the impact of the fee after 12 months. The regulation will also be amended to allow a refund of the fee where matters are discontinued. We think that is reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to regulation 30C, Labor are concerned that this provision might exclude employees from accessing unfair dismissal where they have been absent from work on prolonged unpaid sick leave. The regulation will be amended with a note to make it clear that this provision applies to only the unlawful dismissal provisions and that the commission will still be able to decide whether a dismissal is unfair in the case of extended sick leave entirely without prejudice to these provisions. We thought that was the best outcome we could arrive at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, we think that the regulations as amended will not be more than slight amendments to the old regulations put in place by Minister Brereton, as he then was. In some respects they will provide more protection for employees; in other respects we agree with you: there will be less. In all cases they will provide the certainty which business says was missing from the old regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to now draw a line in the sand on this unfair dismissal matter. This is as far as the Democrats intend to go for an extended period. We think these provisions should be now allowed to bed down so that employers, employees, unions and employer organisations can get used to them and use them and to then see on the basis of empirical evidence whether we need further reform, or more 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2578"> tightening up or better protection on the basis of evidence and experience. I must express to you, Parliamentary Secretary, our concern and some alarm that the government is seeking to make more changes in this area with its latest small business announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats intend to oppose further excluding employees merely because their employer happens to be a small business. You cannot take people and exclude them from one class of rights unless you can clearly show that it is for the common good of society as a whole, and you cannot do so on the basis of belief when you have no empirical evidence to support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think the proposals following from the small business announcement will fail the test of providing a fair go all round. It will be unfair to the most vulnerable and the most industrially unrepresented section of our work force&mdash;the employees of small business. The Democrats will support and indeed already support measures to encourage the Industrial Relations Commission to deal expeditiously with small business unfair dismissal claims. But a wholesale exclusion, as proposed the other day, goes far too far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been disappointed that so far Labor have been ambivalent in their reaction. But I am quite sure that, knowing them, they will soon come out with a very precise statement in this regard. I hope that when I or they move a disallowance on that proposed regulation in a few months, if it is done by regulation, we will both be able to defend workers' rights to have their unfair dismissals reviewed as they have been to date.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Surprise, surprise: it was written into the legislation that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) is able to make regulations based on the size of business. So guess what he is doing? He is making regulations to take away people's rights to be treated fairly. Basically, it looks like he is going to do it in the future. I am pleased to hear Senator Murray indicating that the Australian Democrats want to see this bedded in and not go any further for the moment. But that does not indicate that they are ruling it out in the longer term, supporting allowing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> small businesses to treat their employees unfairly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I often wonder what would happen if it were a matter of criminal law. Would it matter whether you were a small business or a large business as to whether you would be obliged to abide by criminal law? No. If people are entering into contracts, should not the contracts on both sides be required to be upheld? One would think, yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, what we get&mdash;and we already know this as a result of the general workplace relations legislation&mdash;is that the upholding of only one side, the employer's side, is seen as being important and not necessarily any rights on the employee's side of the contract. Those contracts that people have insisted on others writing, it seems, are only useful for one side; that is, to take away from employees or insist on obligations for them to be under. But there does not seem to be a balance achieved with the rights of the employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, I indicate that we recognised right from the beginning that what we saw in the bill was the thin end of the wedge&mdash;indications that people would lose the rights for which they had fought over so many years, so many decades. These rights include reasonable sick leave, and so on. Employees do not necessarily get paid for that leave, but they have fought for the right to be able to be recognised in relation to bona fide sick leave. We have seen indications that those rights are being rolled away very quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I indicate that the Greens WA will be supporting these disallowance motions. Also, we will be watching carefully in relation to any future motions that come up to implement the government's small business statement&mdash;a statement that Labor and the Democrats, according to their indications, welcomed. I guess we will need a few more qualifications to make sure that workers are protected and will not have further rights rolled back and the erosion of their basic rights which have been so hard fought for, by so many people, over so many years and, indeed, so many decades.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is just one matter that was raised by the minister which I would like to comment on. He spoke about the cost of the legal proceedings that had occurred over the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. I know that he did not intend it in this context, but I would hate the impression to be created that there was a cost on fairness and a cost on justice. Some people talk about affordable safety. Some people talk about affordable justice, and I think that is a wrong concept. It is one of the core functions of government&mdash;talking about government in terms of the three arms of government, and in that sense it is one of the core functions of government&mdash;to see justice done and to see it done to everybody no matter what their race, creed, colour, size or age.

I am sure that it is not being brought in on this basis, but if this bill was brought in on the basis that this is the only way in which we can cut costs and that this is really a cost cutting exercise, I think that would certainly send out a wrong message about how we should conduct the affairs of this society. The way the affairs of this society should be conducted is through the proper legal processes. Sure they go wrong, just as the parliament goes wrong and just as government goes wrong from time to time, but that underlying principle is important.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a senator from South Austral 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ia, I am obviously not unaware of the long running controversy of the so&hyphen;called Hindmarsh Island bridge affair. I have never been a great participant in the debate because since it started I have always held other positions in the parliament and so on. But I have certainly supported the previous government's position and have debated it accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that I have noticed over a period of time the ability of people to change their position. I find it ironical that way back in 1992&hyphen;93, when the Chapmans as promoters and developers first proposed the bridge, the bridge was to be built by them at their cost if the government would approve the development of the marina, et cetera, on Hindmarsh Island. When that was changed, they did not have access to the money. In the end, in negotiations with the then Labor state government, the case was that the state government could pick up the cost of the bridge in some significant way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that stage, the then Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, Dean Brown, and the federal member for Barker, Mr McLachlan, publicly and strongly opposed the bridge being built and campaigned accordingly. I find it ironical that they did at that stage oppose it. Furthermore, certainly Mr McLachlan came in a later stage of the whole affair to be an absolute advocate of building the bridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that, as soon as a group of Aboriginal people indicated their opposition to the bridge, Mr McLachlan changed his mind and became a supporter of the bridge being built. For about a year, in 1991-92, he was strongly opposed to the bridge being built. I do not think any of us should get too pure about the range of positions that have been held on this issue, because there has been a fair bit of shifting around in regard to the bridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of us do not support a particular religious view about society. I openly declare that I am an agnostic. I have considerable scepticism about organised religion of all forms. I have always been extremely sceptical of any government attempting to make law in any area involving religion which is based on a mystical or an unproven belief in some 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2582"> thing&mdash;the supernatural, the afterlife and so on&mdash;which is demonstrably a matter of faith and commitment, and not demonstrably proven by scientific fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every time a government moves into that area, it is running a risk of getting terribly entangled and then breaking down the separation between the state and the church. Over the last couple of thousand years or more, every time the church and the states got wrapped up with each other there had usually been some dreadful atrocity committed against those who were declared the non-believers. The Christian church has been just as bad in all its forms as have other faiths&mdash;the Islamic faith, Buddhists and all the variations and forms thereof.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always taken a very sceptical view that, when someone proposes to me that there is a particular religious significance for a particular person and that it should be in a law, that ought to be treated very cautiously. Therefore, when the Ngarrindjeri women indicated that this issue had a particular significance for them, I treated that no differently than someone fronting up to the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of England or an Islamic organisation and saying, `We ought to make laws in an area based on our view or our religious beliefs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You end up making some very difficult decisions, and in the end you probably disadvantage many more people. That is not to say that I do not fully support the Ngarrindjeri women. They are entitled to have that view, even if it is in dispute with others. All religions are in dispute with each other. No&hyphen;one has yet proven that there is a religious view that everyone agrees on. There is always a dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I find very difficult to take is the holding of a royal commission into the religious beliefs or the spiritual beliefs of a group of women&mdash;or any group in the community&mdash;to then find that their views were fabricated or that religious belief was fabricated when they chose not to give evidence. I am not surprised that a royal commission found that that was a belief in which the royal commissioner could not believe. The Ngarrindjeri women who had that belief chose not to give 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> evidence. Can you imagine holding a royal commission into whether immaculate conception took place?</PARA>

But, when it is a group of Aboriginal women who we think hold a stupid view, we proceed to hold a royal commission to prove that they have fabricated that view. I do not care whether they have fabricated it or not. To me, that is not the germane issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that I think the majority of South Australians would say, `Thank goodness a decision has been taken and the bridge has proceeded.' I find that overall in this issue there has been an amount of hypocrisy from people, including members on the other side. When they thought they could attack a former state Labor government for being involved in building the bridge, they opposed it. When the Aboriginal people opposed the bridge, they then seemed to change their minds and they attacked them religiously.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to respond to some of the points raised. Senator Bob Collins raised the social security bill and tried to draw an analogy between 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that and the government's response. I do not think that is valid because there can be no comparison. The Hindmarsh Island legislation and the building of a bridge has been a highly litigated issue, as you know, over three years at least with the expenditure of over $4 million. To draw an analogy or suggest an apparent inconsistency with the social security legislation I think is invalid.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is it. I point out to the committee that&mdash;and I am not going to protract this issue: we have been over the ground enough times&mdash;all of that litigation and money had absolutely nothing to do with any argument about inconsistencies in the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what the relevancy of that distinction is in respect of this particular question, I do not know. It had to do with all of the reports and all of the disputes and the fact that ministers did not read the secret information and so on and so forth. I will not stray on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one other matter that I do want to correct. The minister went on to say that the `opposition opposed precisely this amendment'&mdash;which of course is wrong&mdash;`to the Native Title Bill in 1993'. I was here during that debate. I recall what the minister was referring to. What a pity he only told half the story, because the other half is actually in the act as section 7. That is not correct either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My memory of what happened&mdash;and the Greens and the Democrats and Senator Kernot may have a more precise recollection&mdash;was that effectively there was an assurance that this did not affect the operations of the RDA. One bit was moved by the Democrats and another bit was moved by the Greens. During the negotiations over getting those two bits together, a compromised form of words was, in fact, suggested by former Senator Gareth Evans, who had the carriage of the legislation. That was agreed to, and it appears as section 7 of the act.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2584">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was a distillation drafted by former Senator Evans&mdash;and I was in here when it happened&mdash;of a number of amendments of similar kind moved by both the Democrats and the Greens. This was a distillation of all of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the information that we rejected the amendment is absolutely untrue. There it is in the act. It is part of the law. Minister, if you concede that that argument is flawed in terms of you advancing it as an argument against accepting this, I think in true justice you would have to now tap the mat and agree to support the amendment, or maybe you could redraft it so that it reads in exactly the same way as the one we accepted to the RDA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply conclude by saying that, in respect of a number of other statements that were made about the cost of reports and the length of time for reporting, the minister would be well aware&mdash;but other members of this committee would not be aware&mdash;that the matter was canvassed at some length during the Senate estimates processes and questions that I asked ATSIC officers. We started off with answers that said that the cost could be between nought and a million. I commend the ATSIC officers. They knew exactly where I was heading. I commend their professionalism in trying to do the right thing as best they could for the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pursued the issue. The ATSIC officers&mdash;and, of course, it is ATSIC that is going to have to pay the bill for this, should there have to be a report at any time&mdash;said on the record, and it is in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, their commonsense estimate&mdash;and, Minister, I concede that these are rubbery figures&mdash;of where they thought it might or most likely would end up. The period of time for the report was two months and the estimated cost was $100,000, which I think is probably close to the mark.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Was it $200,000? I thought it was $100,000, but I will not press you on that. It was $200,000. It is a long way from the million, of course, which got a real workout here in the chamber. Again, I do not raise that, Minister, as any substantive issue. The substantive issues are that, once again, some red herrings have been 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thrown in our path tonight. The fact that a lot of money was spent on this act had nothing to do with the RDA&mdash;nothing whatever. Again, it just shows you how difficult it is for the government to try to really make a case for why they accepted this amendment without question in respect of social security but will not with this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say again that the assertion that we rejected this amendment in 1993 is so flatly wrong that it actually became section 7 of the act itself. I urge honourable senators to support it. Let me say, Minister, that if there is an inconsistency with the RDA, there will be a challenge to this act, whether this amendment is carried or not, if someone asserts that it does conflict with the RDA. If it goes through unamended or if it goes through amended, there will still be a challenge to the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that the only defence that the minister can offer, and he has not yet run it, as to why the amendment therefore causes him any complications is if he is concerned that his advice might be wrong and that a court would determine that, because it is a later act of the federal parliament, without this particular amendment it does not in fact technically in a legal sense transgress the Racial Discrimination Act for the simple reason that it overrides it, which is something, of course, that the government has said consistently is not its intention. So I guess what we are saying is, `Prove it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, without going in gory detail through the Evatt review, I would also point out that there is also information right up front in the Evatt review&mdash;not, I might add, argued by anyone in this chamber. It is on page 15 of the Evatt review. It is listed, of course, under Aboriginal concerns about the operation of the act, from their perspective, not going far enough. The heading is `No obligation to make a declaration'. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.33. Aboriginal people are critical of the Act because the power to protect areas and objects is discretionary.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a fact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister is not obliged to act, even if an area is of significance to Aboriginal people&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2585">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A point made again and again, as senators know, in debate in here.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He/she can revoke a declaration without any express requirement to consult the parties. The Act does not specify criteria which, when established, confer a right to a declaration. The political nature of the discretion is discussed in Chapter 10.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is simply a matter of fact. There is no obligation to make a declaration and the minister is not obliged to act even if the area is of significance to Aboriginal people. That absolute discretion under the act, as was confirmed in the recent Boobera Lagoon decision by a court, has always been there. This whole thing has been a furphy from day one and a political beat&hyphen;up of the highest order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After this bill passes the Senate&mdash;with this amendment, should it pass&mdash;there is nothing whatever, so far as this federal parliament is concerned, to prevent the construction of that bridge commencing immediately. So what I suggest to the minister and to all honourable senators, to conclude this debate in the quickest time possible, is for the Senate to support the amendment and to pass the amended bill and to build the bridge.</PARA></SPEECH>

Just before I came here I was talking with Wadjularbinna from the Aboriginal people on the other side of the nation to those at Hindmarsh Island. Senator Margetts is trying to find a means of redressing some of the concern that Wadjularbinna expressed to me as an Aboriginal person&mdash;that is, the need for we non&hyphen;Aboriginal people in this country to understand that we have an obligation to accept a difference in cultures: to accept that the original culture of this country, while subjected to centuries of depredation, exists, is vibrant and is no less important and enriching to this country than the culture we brought so recently to these shores.

If we ignore it we continue to repress people's spirit, and at the same time say, `We do not understand, therefore we do not care, therefore we will ignore you, therefore we are responsible for the consequences.' I think the consequences are far more grave than many people of non&hyphen;Aboriginal culture have assessed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is our responsibility as law&hyphen;makers in this place to face that responsibility, to address our obligation and to incorporate, at least on an equal basis, their cultural, spiritual and legal beliefs when there are dealings with the Aboriginal people of this nation. So it is very important indeed that this motion by Senator Margetts, which seeks to find a way to do just that, be supported. It is a very important motion. It is a very critical means of trying to find an answer to a problem we created&mdash;one for which we have not yet found a solution. We ignore it not only at our peril but also at a great cost to our own esteem further down the line as more and more of us recognise that we are wrong to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wholeheartedly support this motion. I hope it will get the Senate's support. I hope that the Senate will, through this mechanism, try to find a better way of dealing with the phenomenally important and enriching Aboriginal culture of this nation.</PARA></SPEECH>

All sides agree it is necessary and urgent&mdash;there is no question about that. We have gone through a process, as you know. I mentioned previously that I issued a press release late last year announcing proposals for reforming the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act.

A discussion paper on national minimum standards was sent for comment to the states and territories and indigenous, mining, pastoral and other relevant interests today.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2588">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say, Minister, I have some degree of puzzlement as to your opposition to this reference considering the fact that in my view, appropriately and responsively, this major report is an excellent report. I said earlier in the debate today that if anybody has concerns about the operation of this act&mdash;and I have had this criticism made to me directly, and it falls to stony ground if you read this, that this act has been abused by Aboriginal people&mdash;the cold hard facts are that only 99 applications in total over 12 years have even been made under the act. As I said before, this review points out that, as we speak, only one single protection order currently exists in the whole of Australia at Alice Springs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a major piece of work, and I would have thought that before the Senate actually passes any amendments being referred to a Senate committee in some way or other is as certain as the sun rising tomorrow morning is certain. I am not quite sure what you achieve by opposing this, with respect. There will be a reference to a Senate committee of this inevitably at some stage before the Senate passes whatever legislation you might bring forward. Frankly, it might as well go to the committee now as later. Sooner or later it is going to go to a committee; it might as well be tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say on the record&mdash;and I am sure I would be joined by Senator Kernot and Senator Margetts who has moved the motion&mdash;that we will all cooperate to the fullest extent with you, Minister, in expediting that process.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it would shorten proceedings if we have one debate on these three messages. I therefore propose, with the leave 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the Senate, to move a motion in respect of each message at this stage, to make my comments and after the debate has concluded to have the question put separately in respect of each motion. I can foreshadow that I will move in respect of each message that the committee does not press its requests to which the House of Representatives has disagreed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I might assist the committee by stating the government's position. These bills were the subject of amendment by the opposition which resulted in the indexation of the threshold for the private health insurance incentives and for the Medicare levy surcharge. This package of bills was also altered by the opposition's successful rejection of the government's proposed increase of the medical expenses rebate from $1,000 to $1,500.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of further consideration, the government has decided to amend the Taxation Laws Amendment (Private Health Insurance Incentives) Bill 1997 and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996. If I might firstly deal with the taxation laws amendment bill. These amendments deal with schedule 3 and propose that the medical expenses rebate be increased from $1,000 to $1,250. This will entail an increase of 25 per cent rather than the 50 per cent which the government previously proposed. I think it was Senator Harradine who raised that earlier and the government has considered this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that this rebate has not been altered since its introduction in 1985. It is the government's view that a 25 per cent increase over a period of 12 years is hardly what one would call harsh. This amendment has the benefit of easing the impact on those people who claim the rebate but still increasing the incentive for people to move into private health insurance. It also makes a contribution to the budget deficit similar to the original review estimates contained in the 1996-97 budget. This measure will involve an increase to revenue in the region of $20 million in a full year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the second amendment, the government has decided to amend the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2592"> This amendment increases the income threshold for the Medicare surcharge for families by $1,500 for each dependent child after the first child. Hence a family with three dependent children will have an income threshold of $103,000 per annum before the Medicare surcharge is payable. This recognises that families with children have additional expenses associated with those children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's private health insurance incentives package otherwise remains the same. We reject the amendments made by the opposition in relation to the indexation of the respective thresholds in these bills. The opposition amendments will not help stem the flow of people moving away from private health insurance and will result in a loss to the government between now and the year 2000 of over $200 million. Any benefit indexation might bring is far outweighed by this factor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of this indexation brought upon us by the opposition, there will be a void of some $60 million in a full year. Where do we get money to fill that void? Do we take it from worthwhile programs which none of us would like to see affected by such a move? The opposition knows that there is a cost to everything and it has to ask itself whether indexation is worth that sort of decision in order to make a political point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any event, there are good precedents for a fixed threshold. I would refer to the income tax free threshold which exists now. Both this government and the former government have seen fit to preserve this fixed threshold as well as others. There is similarly no need to extend or index the thresholds contained in these bills. I believe the general arguments in matters generally touching on this package were well canvassed when these bills were last before the Senate. I do not intend to delay the Senate further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add, however, that, during the debate on this matter on 4 March 1997, I made a statement that I need to correct. That followed a question from Senator Neal. When discussing in committee the mechanism for changing the qualifying income threshold for the private health insurance incentives, I indicated that this threshold could only be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> changed through a disallowable instrument. I, of course, meant to refer to the actual amount of the incentive rather than the qualifying threshold. It is the amount of the incentive that is the subject of a disallowable instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already advised Senator Neal that I referred to the wrong provision. I believe nothing flows from this. I commend these bills and the government amendments to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. I do wish to indicate that the two amendments that have been circulated in relation to this matter by the government will not be opposed by the opposition. I must confess that they have been circulated quite late, so I have not had the opportunity to appraise in detail the technicalities of the amendments, but I assume that they do what the parliamentary secretary has indicated&mdash;in relation to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill, that it decreases the amount of expenditure that must be incurred before a tax rebate is provided; and in relation to the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, that it provides an additional allowance before the levy comes into play for those who have children. Could the parliamentary secretary confirm that the additional amount allowed to be earned before the levy comes into play is $1,500 per child?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to indicate at this stage that the opposition will not be pressing their first amendment which was moved in the Senate&mdash;that is, amendment to the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill. There is a concern in the opposition that, even though it would be fairer and more equitable for there to be indexation of the income level for payment of the levy, any further attempt to amend this bill may mean that the legislation is delayed and those who need the relief and are looking forward to it may well not receive it as soon as they might otherwise. So we will not be pressing that particular item.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the second amendment that was moved&mdash;to the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, and the indexation of the threshold for those high income earners&mdash;the opposition does intend to continue to press that amendment. In fact, some events that have occurred since this matter first came before the Senate would lead us to the view that it is really very much the position that we feared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was looking back in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> at some of the statements made by the parliamentary secretary. I was somewhat concerned that he may have misled the Senate&mdash;I would hope inadvertently, but potentially intentionally. He was asked by me&mdash;and pressed quite heavily on this point&mdash;whether the government had any plans to reduce the income level where the Medicare levy for high income earners would come into play. The parliamentary secretary responded on at least two occasions&mdash;and I am paraphrasing&mdash;that there were no plans to drop the threshold level. You may recall that, subsequently, a document came into the hands of the opposition that showed that our fears were extremely well&hyphen;founded. That document was in a submission from the department of health to the ERC which suggested that savings could be achieved by reducing the level of the threshold and bringing the levy into play at a lower income level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not make those suggestions lightly. The document that we were provided with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2594"> indicated that copies were given both to Mrs Moylan and to Senator Ellison as the parliamentary secretary to Dr Wooldridge. I would like the parliamentary secretary to respond to that issue and to indicate, firstly, if the government is again prepared to make an undertaking that the threshold will not be dropped for the levy and, secondly, to explain why the statement was made previously that there were no plans when obviously Senator Ellison had in his possession this document that I refer to.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The document to which Senator Neal refers dealt with a number of matters. I can concern myself with only the matters which deal with the areas for which I have responsibility. They do not include the matter raised by Senator Neal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, that document was merely an option which was put by the department. I believe that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has explained in the other place the character of that document extensively. It is not a plan. It is not a decision that the government has taken. It has no standing as a government document as such. Therefore, when the government says it has no plans, it has no plans. That document does not form part of a plan. The common use of the word `plan' in the English language is for a decision that someone is about to embark on. It is a design that someone has decided to implement. That document does not constitute such a thing, and Minister Wooldridge made that very clear in the other place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the extent that I concern myself with only that part of the document which deals with my area of responsibility and did not include the matter that Senator Neil raised, I did not turn my mind to that aspect of the threshold that she mentioned. But, in any event, this document was not a plan nor formed any part of the government's plan. It was an option that departments put to governments from time to time, just as they did when the opposition was in government. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Options were put to the government by the department then but they did not form part of plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I have repeatedly said to those opposite that I cannot give undertakings as to what will be in the budget in this year or any other year. You referred to the statements of Senator Gareth Evans, as he then was, in this very chamber. He gave similar statements to the then opposition when they requested similar undertakings from him.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak to all three bills in just one hit, as it were, unless issues come up, as they tend to in this place, that I cannot resist responding to. I will begin with the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1996. We will not continue to press for this amendment&mdash;indeed, we will also not continue to press for a similar amendment to the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2)&mdash;partly because of the amount of money involved. I think we have made the point very clear to the government that it is now on their head to ensure that the indexation is catered for if they really do believe that this is the way to get people into private health insurance and thereby solve some of the problems being faced by our health system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again make the point that when we look at taking money out of government coffers&mdash;in this case, for health&mdash;it is always tagged to the relevant portfolio area. We are being told that this is a health measure, it will cost $200&hyphen;odd million and therefore it has to come out of the health budget. But when we have the opportunity to raise some moneys, such as from an increase in the Medicare levy, which we will also be debating in a moment, we are told, `No, sorry. We can't actually put the money we raise into health.' We are very quick to take money out but, as was the case when we discussed these bills before&mdash;indeed, it was made very clear by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge)&mdash;there is no guarantee that any of the extra money we raise will end up in the health budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats believe that they need to make this point yet again, so I flag 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2595"> now very clearly that, when we debate the indexation and when we have the third reading on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No.2 ), I will call for a division to make the point that all the additional money we are raising should go&mdash;must go&mdash;into our public health system. I am not speaking about just hospitals, I am talking about our public health system&mdash;be it dental health services, community health services, mental health services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, all the additional money raised from the increase in the levy should go into public health. The government should have given us a much clearer explanation as to why the Democrat amendments that would have raised between $360 million and $380 million a year will not be supported when we could have had a substantial improvement in our public health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that we have some additional amendments before us&mdash;in particular, to the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2)&mdash;in relation to what is now the family surcharge threshold. We are quite happy to work with you on that one. I note also that you are now putting before us a change to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill to reduce the medical expenses rebate threshold from, if I am reading this properly, $1,430 to $1,250. At least we see there is some recognition that a $500 increase&mdash;although it does not look to me like a $500 increase; I am not quite sure where that figure came from, as I thought we were talking about $1,500&mdash;was too high. At least we now have a more reasonable figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As this will now be supported here, all I can say is that surely it is about time this government gave some encouragement to those people who are prepared to self&hyphen;insure. If we do want to see people move into the private sector, we should not keep trying to push them into the private health insurance funds when they have already voted with their feet and shown they really do not wish to get into the prescribed or approved funds. Many people are self&hyphen;insuring. So, whilst we are still disappointed that there is an increase in the rebate threshold, at least it is a lot better than the $500 originally proposed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make two very brief observations. I know time is on the wing and there is not really time to have a full-scale debate on this matter. I feel that the action of the opposition in respect of this has set the scene for some improvements to be made. I acknowledge the work that was done by Senator Neal on that particular matter. The figures that have been given by the government as to the lost revenue does of course bear heavily on my mind. I have come to the view that I will not vote to continue to press for the amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note what the government is proposing here. At least they are starting to recognise that a family of whatever income with children has more necessary expenditure than those without. I commend the government for at least acknowledging that. The amount of $1,500 is, I suppose, a start. I acknowledge that the government has at least attempted to acknowledge that principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am rather concerned as well that the $2,100 per child that is operative in respect of the cut&hyphen;in figure for the Medicare levy to be paid&mdash;I am not talking about the one per cent increase&mdash;has not been changed for about eight years. It is quite clear that the latest figure used by this government in respect of children is $3,000. That $3,000 is operative in respect of the family tax initiative. I would have thought that the government ought to be having a look at that in the context of the budget. That is possible, but presumably the government does not feel it is appropriate for that matter to be determined at this particular stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figure of $1,250 is probably based on inflation and, under those circumstances, I am prepared to accept that. So, in short, I will agree with the propositions being put forward

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect of the question that Senator Neal raised, what she was asking was, I believe: what would the effect be if the motion that is moved by the parliamentary secretary is, first, adopted or, second, negatived? The Taxation Laws Amendment (Private Health Insurance Incentives) Bill contained discrete sections which were excised. Normally, for example, if the motion that you move is negatived, then what would happen is that amendments that are made are, in fact, no longer in the bill. But when the question is put that the clause stand as printed, the effect of a negative vote on this particular occasion would mean, yes, the $1,500 could be retained in the bill.

<PARA STYLE="Para">I hope everyone has now got the motion. The purpose is to provide for three extra sitting days for the Senate just before the start of the winter sittings. It would be Tuesday, 6 May, Wednesday, 7 May and Monday, 12 May. Basically, the first two days of those would be what we might describe as normal Senate schedules, with some variation at the end of the day. Monday would be for government business, and Tuesday the 6th and Wednesday the 7th would then be followed by the two planned estimates days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These extra sitting days and the times and details have been the subject of some discussion around the chamber. They are at the request of the government to facilitate dealing with what we might describe as leftovers from the government's program, which is quite extensive. They are not designed to allow new bills to be debated, but to deal with some of those very important bills that are not going to be dealt with, because of the pressure of time, in this first session.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that we have had before the Senate in this session some very major packages. They have taken considerable time and it has meant that the government was not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> able to make the progress it would desire before the next budget, which, of course, with the new schedule, is brought on earlier this year. With that in mind, we have sought the cooperation and support of other parties and Independents in this place. I put this motion to the Senate urging that it be adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be our intention to give notice to honourable senators, well before these days, of the bills that we would hope to have debated on those days, so that proper preparation can be made for them and orderly practice can be adopted. I also indicate that I recognise that this means that there will be an additional cost for both services to senators and services of the Senate. As it is the government requesting this additional time to meet our programming requirements, we accept that we would have to bear those additional costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do appreciate the spirit within which our request has been discussed tonight. I know that there is not enthusiasm for extra sitting days and I can understand that. But I would ask honourable senators to appreciate that we have put it at the end of this break to facilitate senators' programs&mdash;</PARA>

Of course the following Monday, the 12th, is the start of what will be a sitting week. I therefore hope that it will not unduly inconvenience senators.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did indicate to a meeting of leaders and whips held a short time ago that one of the ironclad laws of business and process in this place is that if you tend to put on extra days or weeks of sittings at the beginning of a session, it is much less likely to be effective than if you in fact add sitting times at the end of a session.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2602">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the last couple of days probably demonstrate that, on all of us, there are certain pressures towards the end of a session and governments are more likely to be able to progress a legislation program then than at the beginning of a session. It is for those reasons that I do not personally believe that Tuesday, 6 May and Wednesday, 7 May are the best options in terms of those days that are available to the government to ensure that the government's urgent legislation program is dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really do think there is a requirement on the government. It is an inexperienced government. It is a government that is obviously struggling to manage the intricacies of legislative programming in this chamber. I think all senators would agree that it has been a particularly poor performance from the government in regard to its management role over the last couple of days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen so many changes in the order of business before the Senate that we really have to concentrate very hard to try to work out what is in the government's mind&mdash;that is, if anything is in the government's mind at all&mdash;as it approaches the task of managing a hefty legislation program. I am sorry to report that Senator Hill and his colleagues do not appear to be up to the task. But the opposition, for its part, with its far greater expertise and experience in these matters, has been able to provide as much assistance as one can in these circumstances. I am pleased to say that we&mdash;Senator Carr, Senator Evans and others with responsibilities; opposition office holders in this regard&mdash;have held out the hand of friendship to try to assist Senator Hill and Senator Campbell in these dark hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Senate is to sit on Tuesday, 6 and Wednesday, 7 May, I think it is appropriate that the ordinary routine of business be dealt with on those days, so that there will be question time and the capacity for the usual matters that senators at times take advantage of, as well as there being a considerable amount of time for dedicated government business.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is true. Of course, Monday, 12 May itself will be a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dedicated government business day. This is a proposal that is obviously only reluctantly embraced by the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really think the task at hand here is for the government to get its act into gear in relation to the management of this chamber. It has been a poor performance. Yes, you have an excuse in terms of your inexperience and lack of understanding of the procedures and processes in this place. But I am sure if you listen more closely to the advice that has been offered, Senator Hill, perhaps next time even you can do a little better than you have been able to manage on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I have indicated on behalf of the opposition is that we will not be taking a dog&hyphen;in&hyphen;the&hyphen;manger approach to this. We are not going to divide on this and waste the Senate's time because clearly there is a majority around this particular proposal. That, I might say, is indicative of the level of cooperation this government has received from the opposition in relation to its legislation program&mdash;something that is acknowledged at times by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill). I place that on record: you do acknowledge it at times. But the point needs to be made that this is a level of cooperation that was never extended to the previous Labor administration during the period that Senator Hill was Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. Any criticism of the opposition, of course, is groundless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am glad, Senator Hill, that at last you realise the approach you took in opposition, now that you have the experience in government to understand the difficulties of managing a legislative program. I hope, Senator Hill, that after the next election when you find yourself back in this chair you will remember it.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the Senate therefore calls on the Government to draft further amendments to the bills to address these concerns.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The purpose of this amendment to the second reading motion is in fact to defer further debate on the surcharge bills in the Senate following the end of the second reading debate this evening. I would like to make it very clear that the effect of voting for this amendment obviously will be to defer consideration of the package of legislation. If that is not carried, the Labor Party will not be voting against the second reading but rather, as I said earlier, will be voting to defer consideration of the bills. If that is not carried, we will be moving into committee to consider a range of amendments that we propose to put to the package of legislation before us this evening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party moves this amendment due to the following reasons. These are reasons which the Labor Party believes are not just critical but fundamental to the whole nature and process of any review of this legislation. The government's stated intention, in imposing the phased&hyphen;in 15 per cent surcharge on all superannuation contributions on high income earners who earn between $70,000 and $85,000, was to introduce greater equity into superannuation. The Labor Party supports greater equity in superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of this position, the Labor Party does support in principle the government's imposition of the phased&hyphen;in 15 per cent surcharge on superannuation contributions made by or on behalf of high income earners. However, the Labor Party does not support the imposition of the full 15 per cent surcharge on middle to low income earners who earn less than $70,000. The inclusion of eligible termination payments, unused payment of leave, redundancy payments and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> other payments will have the effect of requiring low to middle income earners to pay this 15 per cent surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is neither fair nor equitable. Neither is it fair nor equitable when the individual will also be required to pay an advance instalment on the following year's surcharge liability. This means that low to middle income earners will be hit by the initial surcharge liability and then half of that liability again. In the Labor Party's view, it is atrocious that a government would consider imposing a full penalty tax of 15 per cent on the superannuation contributions of those individuals who fail to provide their tax file numbers to the superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In evidence presented to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, AMP amongst others highlighted the difficulty in obtaining tax file numbers from members. AMP had recently conducted a campaign to collect tax file numbers from members and received a mere 11 per cent response rate. The problem that the government does not seem to have understood is that in many cases the superannuation fund has either lost contact with or the ability to contact members. In this situation there is no way of contacting members to request tax file numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further problem is the fact that many individuals do not read the information they receive from the superannuation fund. As a consequence of being either an itinerant, casual or part-time worker or failing to read or comprehend what is sent to them, these individuals will be slugged with a penalty tax. It is also concerning to the Labor opposition that this 15 per cent tax will have a dramatic effect on the family. This is utterly hypocritical from a government that stood solemnly before the Australian electorate last year on 2 March and said they were about families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How will this new 15 per cent surcharge affect the family? The entire concept of superannuation is to introduce intergenerational equity. This means that if I save for my retirement through superannuation perhaps I will lesson the burden I will pass to my children and grandchildren. There is no doubt in anyone's mind that the current age pension of $8,300 is hardly enough for an individual 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2607"> to live on. They do require other financial assistance. Often this assistance is provided by other family members or provision of state services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell the Senate what a massive peace of mind it is for Australians to think that they are doing something positive for their old age by saving. The surcharge will reduce the ability of individuals to save adequate amounts for their retirement income. As a consequence they will be required to ask for help and assistance from their family members. In an era when families are already doing it tough, trying to save for children's education, housing and other necessary essentials, having to provide additional retirement income for older family members is an added burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The surcharge also impacts on the decisions of married women. Women, as we all know, are more likely to take time off during their working lives to have and raise children. During this time out of the work force they are unable to accumulate a significant, if any, level of superannuation savings. When women do return to the work force they normally attempt to put additional contributions into superannuation in order to build their retirement nest egg.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This surcharge bill does not provide for any averaging of annual taxable income and therefore unfairly discriminates against women. I will return to this point a little later, but I would just like to note that if women do not have the ability to benefit from accumulated compound interest as a result of reduced benefits arising from the payment of the surcharge it will impact very heavily on the ability of a family to function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is also extremely concerned about the potential breaching of privacy laws. Superannuation funds are not government agencies. The government clearly stated on Monday when it announced its response to the Small Business Deregulation Task Force package that privacy laws will not extend to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The collection mechanism proposed by the government currently requires all superannuation funds to collect tax file numbers from their members. The superannuation fund is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> then to match tax file numbers with superannuation contributions and provide all this information to the tax office. In compiling all this information, the superannuation funds will be able to ascertain the level of taxable income of individuals. If individuals choose to make this information unavailable or fail to provide tax file numbers they will be slugged the full 15 per cent tax. This means that individuals have no rights to protect their privacy in relation to income levels and, of equal importance, the funds have no duty to protect the privacy of individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor is also concerned about the number of  constitutional questions that have been raised in relation to this legislation. First the government had to announce that Federal Court judges would be exempt from the surcharge due to the section 72 constitutional protection in relation to their remuneration. Then the states came out arguing that the Commonwealth could not tax the states on two different grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the state schemes are unfunded and therefore paid out of consolidated revenue. The money does not become the property of the member until payment of benefit. This means that prior to payment of benefit it is the property of the states. Under section 114 of the constitution, the Commonwealth is not able to tax the property of the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point that the states made related to the taxation power in section 51(2) which prohibits the Commonwealth from discriminating in taxation between states. Due to the different superannuation scheme designs used by states it will undoubtedly be the case that some states will have to pay higher surcharge liabilities than other states. This, the states have argued, would be unconstitutional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the problem of state judges and magistrates. Appearing before the Select Committee on Superannuation, state judges and magistrates argued quite convincingly that they are required to perform some federal duties in relation to the AAT, the Social Security Tribunal, et cetera. They should also be afforded the protection of section 72 of the constitution. Judges and magistrates also argued that should this legislation pass they would consider a High Court challenge.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2608">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the Treasurer and Senator Kemp say in relation to these problems? `Don't worry; it's fine. We are in negotiation with the states over this issue. They will come to the party.' It is unfortunate for the government that today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on page 1 it quite clearly states that the states are not about to come to the party. We will have the ludicrous position where all Commonwealth employees and private sector employees will have to pay the surcharge. However, if you are employed by a state government&mdash;and there are at least 25,000 employees of state governments&mdash;you will not have to pay the surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation got worse. On 11 March the Business Council of Australia represented by Dennis Rose QC indicated they believed that the whole bill was unconstitutional because of clause 34. He indicated that it would be beyond the constitutional power of the Commonwealth to levy a tax on an individual and require a third entity to pay it on their behalf. As the entire bill revolved around this issue, Mr Rose suggested the entire bill be withdrawn for redrafting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Labor opposition raised this issue with the government we saw utter confusion on the government side. First the Treasurer said that there was no constitutional issue. Then he said that the government would look into it. Then he said that the government would seek further legal advice. Then the PM said that it was a plot by the superannuation funds. I have never been aware that the Business Council of Australia was a superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then finally last Thursday the government introduced some amazing amendments to delete clause 34. You said that there was no problem and it was all okay. In a press statement released today, the government indicated that further amendments will be required to allow trustees to reduce a member's benefit to pay the surcharge liability. It is funny, Senator Kemp; I think I raised this issue in question time yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the fourth set of amendments introduced into this package of legislation. This is policy being made up on the run. This is simply not acceptable for a bill of this level 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of significance. The government has introduced two new bills and three sets of amendments to the bills and, presumably, the fourth set is on the way to try to fix the gaping holes in the legislation. Of course, the problem that has continually plagued the government on this issue is that once they attempt to fix one problem, another emerges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I would like to make is in regards to the amendment that I am moving in relation to eligible termination payments, unpaid leave, sick leave and other once-off payments that will be caught under the definition of adjustable taxable income. The effect of this definition will be to unfairly tax hundreds of thousands of Australians who would not normally earn sufficient levels of income to be caught by the tax. I have some further comments that I will not make on this matter at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to point out that this legislation is possibly unique in Australian political history. It combines a blatant repudiation of a cast&hyphen;iron pre-election commitment not to introduce new taxes and it steadfastly refuses to honestly acknowledge the breach. It does not call the tax a tax; it calls it a surcharge. Frankly, the government has created greater political problems for itself by not frankly acknowledging it is a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a massive increase in compliance costs and procedures from the government, supposedly committed to lessening the burden of red tape on business; a reduction in the benefits of all members of superannuation funds from the surcharge; a complete alienation of the superannuation industry and related professional advisers, such as accountants, financial advisers and actuaries; no cooperation from the states and territories; the prospect that the revenue  estimated to be collected will not be collected from those at whom the tax is aimed; and the complete lack of commitment that the government is showing to its national savings objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What type of messages do these bills send to those individuals who are doing the right thing in saving for their retirement? More particularly, what type of message does this package of legislation send to those individuals for doing the right thing and taking their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2609"> retirement as a pension? Instead of encouraging these people to save and take their superannuation as a pension, the government is going to tax them at a much greater level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the biggest farces of the government so far has been the untruthfulness of the taxation debate. The government has made a number of outrageous, deliberately untrue commitments before the last election concerning taxation. They then solemnly promised on many occasions not to introduce new taxes nor to increase the existing rate of taxes. The people of Australia believed that they could rely on that commitment. They are sorely disappointed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had the Treasurer, Mr Costello, Senator Short&mdash;your predecessor, Senator Kemp&mdash;the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and various officials from revenue agencies bend over backwards to say that the surcharge is not a tax. They have obfuscated through the other place, the Senate, the estimates committees and numerous media interviews. All the semantic gymnastics diminish the Treasurer's and the government's standing with the public and the media. Unequivocally, the answer is yes, a surcharge is a tax. It is classified in the budget papers as a tax by the Bureau of Statistics. I could not put it better than Dennis Rose QC, who remarked before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, `It is plainly a tax.' Of course, nobody, not even the Treasurer, can maintain the pretence of such a preposterous claim forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over time Mr Costello, the Treasurer, has even slipped up. We first saw this on the John Laws program on 26 February 1997 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tax that is collected on employer contributions will be 30 per cent rather than 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Note `the tax'. This was a clear, if inadvertent, admission that he had been fibbing since the budget. On 12 March 1997 on Radio National the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So this is nothing new that we are introducing in the sense of the contributions tax. It's been operating for quite some time. What we're doing is we're changing the rate in relation to high income earners.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is another blatant admission that this is a tax. Again, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM </EMPHASIS> program, we heard 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the attempted adroit language of the Treasurer. He finally dropped the pretence when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, it's a surcharge which reduces the tax concession currently available to high income earners.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The interviewer persisted and asked the Treasurer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How can you look people in the eye and say that this is not a tax?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, he did not answer the question directly; he knew he would be caught out. But he did not admit the truth, and he still has not done so consciously. As a result, the public now knows that the surcharge is, in fact, a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS>newspaper got it pretty right on 13 March with the headline, `Costello concedes super slug is a tax.' Perhaps the Assistant Treasurer or his parliamentary secretary could advise the Senate that if it is not a tax, why is it collected by the Australian Taxation Office and why is it necessary to provide a tax file number to avoid being caught in the net?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, as I have mentioned, we are very concerned that we are dealing with this matter at this time. It is a very important budget measure. It should have been dealt with much earlier in the government's program.</PARA></SPEECH>

It would be an understatement to say that this legislative package is complex and that it creates great difficulties for superannuation funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The complexity stems from a fundamental flaw&mdash;that is, the refusal of the government to collect this new tax on high income earners as a tax on high income earners. Instead, the government has gone to incredible and ridiculous lengths to ensure that the tax is collected by someone else. In this case it is by the superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result will be a $100 million impost on superannuation funds, reducing the earnings 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2610"> capacity of those superannuation funds and reducing the investment returns paid to the 95 per cent of people who will not pay the surcharge. This is so that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) does not have to admit to his own high income earning mates that they will be paying more tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it gets worse. The 95 per cent of people who earn less than $85,000 could still end up paying the tax surcharge if they refuse, if they forget or if they are simply unable to provide a tax file number to their superannuation provider. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation was told by the super fund administrators that they expect, at best, about 40 per cent of members will get around to providing their tax file numbers and, on their past experience, the funds cannot even find an address to contact about 20 per cent of their members. So up to 60 per cent of workers could end up paying an extra 15 per cent tax on their superannuation for simply not getting around to providing a tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the legislation gets worse still. Accountants have advised us that high income earners are likely to desert superannuation in large numbers, rearranging their salary packages into fringe benefits, shares, negatively geared property and other more tax effective devices. The extent of these transfers may not be as dire as predicted, but I would expect to see many high income earners in the private sector with access to salary packaging taking a very long, hard look at their superannuation. With the phasing in between $70,000 and $85,000, they face marginal tax rates of between 85 per cent and 103 per cent on their superannuation contributions. So I would certainly expect to see some movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only people without access to salary packaging paid above the $70,000 cut-off could end up being senior public servants and politicians. So we could end up with a situation where most high income earners exit the system, but most low income earners get swept up by the surcharge and the fund earnings of all are reduced by the massive cost of collecting tax file numbers and administering the surcharge. While that is the worst case scenario, I think it would be most remiss 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the parliament to pass legislation capable of producing such a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, the legislative structure set up by this package of seven bills has very serious problems. I think that is a pity because the intent of the bills is something that the Democrats very strongly support. We strongly believe that superannuation contributions by high income earners are excessive and that they need to be reduced. The current superannuation concessions total about $6.4 billion a year and, according to our research, the six per cent of people earning over $50,000 receive 33 per cent of those concessions while the 22 per cent of people earning less than $21,000 receive just three per cent of the concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They run hard against women, who receive just 26 per cent of superannuation concessions even though they make up 55 per cent of those aged 60 or more. This is clearly a ludicrous result. It flows because the contributions tax on superannuation is a flat 15 per cent. For someone earning over $50,000 this means a 33c in the dollar tax concession. But for someone earning under $21,000, it is a concession of just 6c in the dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An EPAC report in 1994 by Howard Pender found that employer superannuation contributions provided the most tax effective investment possible for high income earners. Others such as Fred Argy from CEDA, Professor John Head from the Monash University, ACOSS, and former Treasury Deputy Secretary and National Commission of Audit member John Fraser have also called for reform of these concessions. That Labor refused to do so for so long showed how close the Keating government had become to the rich and powerful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do support reform of superannuation tax concessions. Indeed, the only gripe we have with this legislation's intent is that it does not go far enough. Why should people earning between $50,000 and $70,000 receive a tax concession worth five times as much as lower income earners? We believe it would be far fairer to provide a flat rebate to all employees at all classes of income&mdash;indeed, this was the coalition's election policy, Fightback, in 1993.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2611">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we support the intent. What we do not like is the way the government wants to collect it. If the government acknowledges that this surcharge is a tax, it would be halfway there. Then it would not be trenchantly opposed to collecting the tax surcharge off the people it is trying to target&mdash;the high income earners&mdash;rather than through an elaborate subterfuge through superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate superannuation committee received a wide range of submissions from an extraordinary variety of sources urging the use of the income tax system as the collecting mechanism. They included the Business Council of Australia, the ACTU&mdash;very rarely seen on the same side of the fence, I might say&mdash;the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, the MTIA and more muted support from the Australian Council of Social Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But for their efforts, the government has simply pilloried them. I wish to record my disapproval of the attack on the superannuation industry, particularly ASFA and Susan Ryan, from the government, arguing that the industry is wanting to defeat the tax. ASFA in our view has been entirely responsible in this debate, accepting that the contribution will be paid but arguing only about the best means of collecting it. I wish to publicly acknowledge the very excellent work of ASFA in exposing the flaws in this legislation whilst always accepting its intent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other submissions to the Senate inquiry found major flaws with the legislation as well. The government still has not properly responded to the arguments of Dennis Rose QC that this bill is probably unconstitutional, nor has it responded to the arguments about the privacy considerations of requiring, under the weight of a massive tax penalty, all taxpayers to provide tax file information and, with that, information about their taxable income to private sector organisations. I have to say that this is a massive invasion of privacy from a coalition government which, as I recall, so vigorously opposed the Australia Card as the great defender of individual rights and privacy. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These issues are automatically fixed with an alternative collection mechanism. ASFA had developed and circulated to senators a set of amendments to show how an alternative collection mechanism could be set up. The Democrats support the general design of the collection mechanism as proposed by ASFA, but we have decided not to move amendments in the committee stage to establish the collection mechanism, simply because of the complexity involved in doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the best outcome for this package would be for the government to withdraw it and to design a new tax collection mechanism which utilises the PAYE system and which does not involve a massive cost for superannuation funds. That is what they ought to do but, as we know, this is not what they are going to do. The Treasurer has indicated to us again and again&mdash;most recently today, and publicly, of course, many times&mdash;that he will not change the collection mechanism. So despite all the evidence presented to the Senate committee inquiry and despite the unanimous view put by so many industry bodies calling for change, the government thinks that it knows better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kemp, I have to tell you that this is a piece of legislation that you can have. You can wear it. We will vote for your legislation without amendment, not because it is good legislation, not because it is fair legislation, but on the clear understanding that you wear the consequences of what we regard as an appalling piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my hope that every superannuation fund in Australia will tell their members next year how much their earnings on three accounts were reduced by the massive administration costs of Treasurer Costello's clumsy and inefficient tax. I hope that the 50 per cent of people likely to be slapped with the tax for forgetting to quote a tax file number to a non&hyphen;government body are made aware that Treasurer Costello did it to them. And I hope that some super funds get so angry that they take it to the High Court and that the court tells the Treasurer that this surcharge has no constitutional basis. And it will be entirely, completely and utterly the government's fault.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2612">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a great pity in all of this that the administrative and fiscal minefield that this tax will create will almost certainly kill stone dead any popular support for further necessary reform of superannuation tax concessions, but the government must wear that, too. And when the evidence is in, if Treasurer Costello or his successor as Treasurer decides that the tax needs to be reviewed, we would be happy for you to come and talk with us. We will resist the opportunity to say, `We told you so,' and will help you to revise the tax and put in place a mechanism that you should have taken the opportunity to introduce in the first place.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will say at the outset of our contribution to this package of superannuation surcharge bills that, fundamentally, the Greens (WA) support the concept of progressive taxation. In respect of this package of bills, it means we accept the principle of some kind of superannuation surcharge, given that for many years high income earners have used the special tax treatment of superannuation to reduce tax obligations by voluntarily depositing surplus capital in superannuation funds. These are often not the same kind of superannuation funds the average worker has access to, but may instead allow high income earners various options to control investment in their own interest, and to withdraw from the fund with minimum cost when they decide it is convenient.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an entirely different form of use, and it creates very different opportunities from those available to ordinary workers, who often find they have no choice as to fund, and that their money is placed in funds which penalise someone taking money out before they reach retirement age. In addition, it is not a means of reducing tax; it is a reduction in disposable income for those whose income is primarily spent on necessities. It is a reduction in the income of those who can least afford such a reduction, including those who are only working part time or casually in low income jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In general, there is nothing equitable about superannuation. It may be of some benefit to workers. It might be, and has been, argued 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that ordinary working Australians are so improvident that they must be forced to save for their retirement because they will not do so on their own. However, ordinary Australians have managed their incomes for years and many are fairly canny about living on modest incomes and can see other potential ways of using money which may bring greater returns long term, and real returns, not only for themselves but for their dependants in the short term. Purchasing a house, or somewhere to live in your later years, is often such an option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With high income earners, we talk about those earning over $70,000 in taxable income after all deductions and other ways of minimising tax. We are talking about less than seven per cent of Australian taxpayers&mdash;not seven per cent of citizens. Such high income earners have no problem purchasing a house, using negative gearing to purchase investment properties, opening family trusts, and utilising the optimum mix of salary, superannuation and fringe benefits. These are the people who have the money to utilise options like income splitting as a potential rort. For the majority of Australians, the use of trusts for dependants often represents sacrifice with the intention of providing for loved ones. But for the rich, they can use options to create structures where income is shifted to another without that other having any real control, and where those assets are not permanently assigned, but can be shifted back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure of the government would place an additional level of tax on such high income earners. To this extent, we support it, as we have supported the establishment of some additional rates of progressive taxation for higher income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, while we support the general principles of progressive taxation, and while we support the general principle of ending the use of incentives for superannuation savings to provide tax shelters for the wealthy, we have serious questions about the mechanisms of this bill. In the first place, this is fundamentally a tax. Call it by whatever name you wish; it is a tax. In fact, it seems that by calling a tax by any other name, the govern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2613"> ment may simply be opening itself up to other various problems. I understand that the federal government has the legal ability to impose taxes. Does it have the legal ability to impose income&hyphen;based surcharges on the general public? And what about the word `surcharge?' A surcharge is an additional charge. Additional to what? What is the government charging the rich for?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A levy is something comprehensible. It is tax, often for a given period, collected for a dedicated purpose&mdash;for example, the Medicare levy, should I say theoretically, or the proposed employment levy. But this money is being collected for undefined purposes, presumably going into general revenue. In what sense, other than name, is it different from a tax? And, if it is an income based tax, why is it not dealt with in the Income Tax Assessment Act?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is odious to see a government promise not to raise taxes and then go ahead and raise taxes and try to pretend it is not doing so on the pretext of calling them by some other name, and then insist they are not taxes. I have no problem with government imposing taxes if necessary. I never have. I have little problem with governments coming forward and saying that they cannot keep their election promises, especially the more extravagant ones, as long as they come clean and say so, and say why, openly, and then accept the consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think the blind attempt in politics to pillory governments for their inability to keep improvident promises, or promises to do something stupid or socially or environmentally destructive is a good thing. I would rather government did something sensible and good for the community than keep promises that are stupid or destructive, though this does not mean I accept making reckless promises for political gain as a good thing. But, if the government, as it has, promises not to raise taxes, and finds that this is not a workable promise, not a promise that can be kept without causing the people of Australia inordinate pain&mdash;and, if I am cynical enough to suggest, electorate pain&mdash;then it should come forward honestly and say so. The government should apologise and outline the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reasons for breaking its promises. Above all, what it should not do is pretend it is keeping its promises, while finding weasel words and fox phrases to try to make black white.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with lying and attempting to persist in a lie is that you must slowly attempt to falsify all reality in order to make the lie fit as truth. I ask: if this is not a tax, under what constitutional powers does the government impose this so&hyphen;called surcharge? I understand there have already been constitutional challenges and the only basis government has for imposing this is under the powers of taxation. If that is so, this is a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a problem with this sort of stuff because not only is it ethically unclean but it results in hideous legislation, as something that should be treated in a perfectly clear and straightforward way is covered up to allow the weasel words some reality. We have seen this last year with the infamous family tax package, where the Income Tax Rates Act was besmirched so that was a simple $200 contribution could be called a $1,500 change of tax thresholds. Here we see a whole new section of legislation, a new power of the Commonwealth and a 50&hyphen;page alternative to the Income Tax Assessment Act created. How dare the government, and just to cover up a lie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear to anyone that this thing is a tax. It should have been treated as a tax. It should have been introduced as an amendment to the tax act, a modification of the tax treatment of superannuation. If the government had gone that way, it could have been done perhaps in a couple of pages with none of this legal ambiguity about Commonwealth power. Not only could it have done so, it could probably have availed itself of measures such as the availability of those with periodic incomes&mdash;farmers, artists, athletes&mdash;to average the incomes. This would have eliminated some of the injustices that are likely to perpetuate, which have been highlighted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it is clear that a disproportionate benefit is obtained by wealthy people from concessional tax treatment of superannuation contributions, it should also be clear, on a moment's reflection, that there will be some taxpayers who may on occasion get a high 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2614"> income, but not regularly. A farmer may have a good year, maybe two, where they are taxed at the highest rate. It may be followed by several years of drought. Under the income tax law, they have the ability to average their income and may not have to pay at the highest rate. Here, in your pocket duplicate of income tax law, there is no such capacity. What a shame, and all because you have not got the stomach to call a tax a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not go on at much greater length. Obviously, the thing to do is to take this misbegotten bill away, and re&hyphen;write it as a tax bill. The outcome would be clearer and less contentious. And, of course, contention is the other price you have paid for your inability to call a tax a tax. You have a Senate that unanimously supports your underlying intent of taxing high income earners at a slightly higher rate, at least in regard to their superannuation contributions. But, by refusing to use the proper name for things and refusing to take the simple, clean and honest option, you have managed to build almost unanimous opposition to this bill. You are your own worst enemies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens will be supporting the ALP second reading amendment to take this bill away and re&hyphen;submit it after substantial re&hyphen;drafting. We suggest strongly that you do not, in hubris, oppose this measure. It is actually a government policy the Senate is willing to see passed, as long as it is in a workable form. We are willing to help you. We would like to see this work, and know that it is not likely to work if pass it as it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I strongly suggest that you take this course. I think you will have the goodwill of the Senate in re&hyphen;drafting it so that we can pass it speedily. I put to you that it is not an efficient or good use of power to pass bills or put things in place that will have to come back session after session to be dealt with again and that require us to drop all other things to put it through speedily because of your own bad treatment in the first place. It is not so hard to get it right. It is not so hard to give families a child rebate, for instance, or to impose a tax. But it becomes very difficult when you have to insist that this is not actually what you are doing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the government has the sense not to oppose the ALP second reading amendment. It would allow us to go to some legislation we might usefully address instead of getting bogged in an interminable committee stage debate. It might even allow us to end this session at an hour not entirely unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I give notice that, if the second reading amendment is not carried, we will support most of the amendments by the various opposition parties that we have seen. I do not like trying to fix this particular mess without getting rid of what is here now, but we will do so if we have no other options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also give notice that it is entirely possible that we will not be able to support the bill if some modifications are not made. So I ask the government to actually listen to the debate and consider the issues raised on their merits instead of blindly opposing everything that the Senate is quite helpfully trying to suggest at this stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If income averaging is equitable for farmers, for artists and sports people there is no reason why some form of life time income averaging through superannuation should not be available to every person gaining an income from personal exertion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is interesting to observe that the concept behind the superannuation tax surcharge has been previously considered and rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor William Vickrey now Professor Emeritus of Colombia University and a former President of the American Economic Association examined in 1947 the idea of taxing employer superannuation contributions in the hands of the employee&mdash;the same concept as the surcharge. In his book Agenda for Progressive Taxation he wrote at page 82 "In principle, the correct method of taxation for all such pension and insurance plans would be to include in the income of the employee the value of the entire contribution to the pension fund both by himself and by the employer on his behalf, and in addition the interest earned by this fund as it accumulates. The pension itself would then be treated as an annuity. But this solution is even more impractical than in the case of life insurance and annuity contracts of life insurance companies. Often the employer does not know how his gross contribution to the fund is equitably divided among his employees. In any event it would still be open to him to postpone his employees' income and hence their tax, by making no explicit contribution to the fund until it was actually needed to make the benefit payments. What is really required is not the contributions he actually makes but those that he should theoretically make to cover the actuarial value of his liability. But many pension plans are such that this actuarial value cannot readily be determined: benefits may hinge on non-actuarial contingencies such as continued service, or may be awarded ex postfacto `in consideration of long and faithful service,' etc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"As with insurance, the only hope for a completely proper treatment is through the application of cumulative averaging"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus as early as 1947 the superannuation surcharge concept was examined and rejected by an acknowledged expert.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superannuation taxation is not a matter of concern for those few persons lucky enough to have an income from inherited property. It is, however, of great importance for those who have to provide for themselves and their families from their own labour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This issue was also addressed over a hundred years ago by John Stuart Mill in his Principles of Political Economy (Book V chapter ii sec 4) when he dealt with the question whether the same percentage rate should be levied on perpetual and on terminable incomes. He observed that "in spite of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the nominal equality of income, A, an annuitant of &pound;1,000 a year, cannot so well afford to pay &pound;100 out of it, as B who derives the same annual sum from heritable property; A having usually a demand on his income which B has not, namely, to provide by saving for children or others; to which, in the case of salaries or professional gains, must generally be added a provision for his own later years; while B may expend his whole income without injury to his old age, and still have it all to bestow on others after his death. If A, in order to meet these exigencies, must lay by &pound;300 of his income to take &pound;100 from him as income tax is to take &pound;100 from &pound;700, since it must be retrenched on that part only of his means which he can afford to spend on his own consumption. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The principle, therefore, of equality of taxation, interpreted in its only just sense, equality of sacrifice, requires that a person who has no means of providing for old age, or for those in whom he is interested, except by saving from income, should have the tax remitted on all that part of his income which is really and bona fide applied to that purpose. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"perhaps a deduction of one-fourth in favour of life-incomes would be as little objectionable as any which could be made, it being thus assumed that one-fourth of a life-income is, on the average of all ages and states of health, a suitable proportion to be laid by as a provision for successors and for old age."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle of life time income averaging has found favour with economists since John Stuart Mill wrote in 1871. Professor William Vickrey makes the point in his 1947 treatise Agenda for Progressive Taxation, (p 166) that "there would still be a very serious doubt of the equity of taxing each year's income as a separate entity. With progressive rates, an individual whose income fluctuates from year to year will, under this method, pay a heavier tax than an individual having the same average income more evenly distributed from year to year." Vickrey goes on at p 186 to point out that it is logical in fact to average a taxpayer's income over his lifetime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is quite remarkable, is it not, that an English Conservative government in the middle of the Napoleonic Wars&mdash;at a time when the Combination Acts were used to suppress trade unions&mdash;was willing to be more liberal in its tax treatment of labour income than is the Australian Federal Government of today. It is also interesting that the bureaucrats who designed this legislation are willing to run barefoot into minefields where even the most speculative academic is afraid to tread.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators may wish to ponder these paradoxes at leisure but before departing from this subject I might point out that, not only does the superannuation surcharge produce wholly inequitable outcome 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2616"> in the case of pensions or annuities, it is also quite unworkable in the case of unfunded State government pensions schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State governments do not have to pay this tax. Even if the Melbourne Corporation Case did not exist and there were no Constitutional immunity for the Crown in right of a State in its dealings with its servants, the State governments can take another tack.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is nothing to stop State governments reverting to the practice followed in l9th Century Britain of simply placing aged servants on half pay and never formally fully retiring them from their offices. A State, for example, could create an internal Treasury trust fund and use it to meet the half pay of its inactive aged civil servants, much as the British Government used to put former Generals and Admirals on half pay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This being a State's House I think we should let the States know that they need not subject themselves to this legislation whether or not it is passed. And if States and their civil servants can not be subjected to this surcharge in respect of de facto pensions or annuities, where is the equity in imposing it on the rest of the workforce?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many other points that will be raised on these Bills. There is not time to go into all of them now but it is my firm view that it should be accepted that the application of the provisions of the legislation to taxable pensions or annuities is quite inappropriate, unjustified and unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An exemption is required where otherwise surchargable contributions are used to finance pensions or annuities. No one can possibly argue that someone receiving a taxable pension or annuity in retirement is somehow getting an unfair treatment from the tax system. On the contrary to impose this surcharge on pensions or annuities is to implement a form of double taxation which in many cases is retrospective in its effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This much has been acknowledged by provisions in the Bills which propose that Public Service pensions be unilaterally cut. It does not do much for confidence in the public credit of the Commonwealth of Australia for a Government to be legislating unilaterally to cut its obligations under terms and conditions of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is rightly concerned about Australia's international credit rating. How does it think readers in the Wall Street Journal or the Financial Times will react when it is drawn to their attention that the Commonwealth Government of Australia is quite willing to propose legislation unilaterally reneging on quasi-contractual obligations or wiping out accrued rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superannuation and national savings are suffering a crisis of confidence because of the perceived threat of legislative risk. Short-term revenue

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, I look forward to reading the speech you have incorporated. I will not comment on it now because I have not had a chance to read it, so do not regard that as a discourtesy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to comments made by honourable senators in relation to these important bills which are before the parliament, as indicated by a number of speakers these form an important part of, first of all, restoring equity in the area of superannuation. I welcome the fact that most senators indicated that it was important to ensure greater fairness in the superannuation system. Senators accepted, as indeed did the Senate committee, the concept of the 15 per cent surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In much of the debate which has occurred in recent months that important principle may have been obscured as particular groups sought to advance their cases. In listening to the debate this evening I was mindful of a recent article about the surcharge written in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> by Ross Gittins where he cautioned that nine out of 10 people who say, `It is not what you did; it is the way you did it,' are lying. There is an attempt in the wider debate&mdash;I am not suggesting in this chamber&mdash;to undermine the surcharge by advancing problems and issues which are entirely spurious. Let me just illustrate this with one point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt, as Senator Allison said, the concessions to superannuation greatly benefit high income earners, and yet the spurious argument has been run&mdash;including, I regret to say, in this chamber tonight&mdash;in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2617"> attacking this measure, which is above all about fairness, that low and middle income earners will be affected. This issue has been canvassed many times in this chamber in recent months and, as I and others have said, not one low or middle income earner need pay the surcharge. All they have to do is provide their tax file number to the superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has given careful consideration to considering alternative options to collect the surcharge. We believe that the option we have chosen is the best option. It is an efficient option, and it avoids imposing additional costs on small business. We reject the ASFA proposal, which would directly involve some 900,000 employers rather than requiring, as these bills before the chamber do, a reporting obligation on behalf of some 137,000 superannuation funds. The alternative mechanism which has been proposed would involve substantial costs on small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some commentators advanced an argument about whether superannuation would still be a good investment. I agree with Senator Allison that much of the comment in this area had been greatly overstated. According to BT funds management analysis, the clear message is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do not forsake superannuation as a core part of your investment folio. Even with a surcharge bringing contributions taxed to 30 per cent, you will need substantial returns from other investments to get better after tax benefits.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think a lot of the comments have been overstated and designed to protect a very important tax concession available to high income earners. I regret that the Labor Party has, in its attack on this measure, quite spuriously run the argument which is incorporated in Senator Sherry's second reading amendment, which we will certainly be opposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The use of TFNs was raised. People might not have realised that the fact of the matter is that the ability of funds to use TFNs was a Labor policy. In fact, the Labor Party introduced a bill to assist superannuation funds to collect tax file numbers. Senators will be aware that, under the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2), which was recently passed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by the Senate, funds will be able to collect tax file numbers for all superannuation accounts. That started on, I think, 16 February. There were arguments that the funds were finding it difficult. It is worth recording that this procedure has been in place for some four weeks.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SHERRY" NAMEID="ZW4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator Sherry</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That doesn't mean they'll get them.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sherry, the funds will have up to 12 months to collect tax file numbers. This is another spurious attack launched on the approach that we have taken. You would not have thought, from what Senator Sherry said in some of the issues he raised in relation to tax file numbers, that he and his colleagues were driving forces just a little over 12 months ago in allowing funds to collect tax file numbers. I put that on the record in case people who listened to Senator Sherry may have felt that they perhaps missed an important point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be opposing the second reading amendment, which is a very poorly worded amendment. It says that the government is to bring forward further amendments. I would have thought that the opposition were unhappy with the bill. They of course have the right to bring amendments. At last, at a very late stage in the debate, we have the committee stage amendments that the Labor Party are proposing to move. I put on the record the fact that Senator Sherry spoke to me some weeks ago and tried to ensure that we were able to provide the amendments to the Labor Party, which we do always in an expeditious fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reading amendment which is drafted is plainly wrong in so many cases and seriously misleading in other cases. It is illogical in that it urges the government to fix up problems which the government does not accept are problems. The Senate is of course entitled to address its mind to particular issues, but I certainly would not accept that the government should go away and fix up problems which we do not accept are problems at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, if you take 2(a) and 2(b) in the amendment, the reality is that they are grossly misleading&mdash;absolutely and totally 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2618"> misleading and totally wrong. Senator Sherry's amendment says that at least one million low and middle income earners may be liable to the surcharge. The short answer is, and I said it earlier in my remarks, that not one person needs to pay the surcharge; all they have to do is supply their tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is part of the deliberate scare campaign that Senator Sherry relentlessly runs in a desperate attempt to grab a headline, which he finds difficult to get, and to undermine a very fair measure. Senator Sherry, if you succeeded in your ultimate aim to overturn these bills, which is implicit in the amendment you have moved, the low and middle income earners would not be cheering, but the big end of town would be cheering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not accept the amendment you have moved&mdash;the quite spurious claims about low and middle income earners and the quite spurious comments about the constitutionality of the bill, and that has been addressed many times in this chamber. We have effectively addressed those issues. You have asked me questions about those issues, if not on a daily basis, on a very regular basis. We do not accept those claims which you have put forward. In relation to privacy, which is another part of your amendment, we have confidence in trustees upholding the privacy of members&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SHERRY" NAMEID="ZW4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator Sherry</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, confidence!</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought you were supportive of the trustee structure. I am interested to hear that you now appear to have some particular qualifications. In relation to the states, we have made it very clear that we are negotiating with the states to make appropriate arrangements to cover public servants. You would not believe, in reading this amendment, that bona fide redundancy payments are excluded. I would have thought that was a very important point, but it is completely brushed over and ignored in the amendment you have moved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill and the concepts have been debated very widely in this chamber. They have been the subject of a Senate committee report. They have been very extensively debated in the lower house. Senator Sherry has decided 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not to alter at least the principle of the collection approach that we have adopted. We welcome that. We are currently analysing the amendments he has put forward and we are trying to work out what he is seeking to achieve there. I look forward to some further advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do record that these amendments came on the scene exceedingly late, and that is a pity. For an office which often approaches my office, and we extend all courtesies we are able to extend, I think it is a pity that these amendments have appeared on the scene so late, which of course makes it difficult to ensure that all issues are properly canvassed. So I urge the Senate to reject the second reading amendment that Senator Sherry has proposed. It is an illogical amendment, it is wrong, it is misleading and it seeks to undermine a fair measure and an important budget measure.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Firstly, I should explain the reason why we do not have a running sheet. Even though our amendments were in some hours ago for compilation into a running sheet, the Australian Democrats have withdrawn all their amendments. This meant that the entire running sheet had to be rewritten. I do not criticise the Democrats for that; that is their prerogative. But I was not aware of that having happened until about 35 minutes ago, which meant that the running sheet could not be prepared in time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the issues that we are considering. I know there are a substantial number of amendments, but many of those which we are considering tonight deal with the same issues. On this occasion we are dealing with a substantial number of amendments: 1 to 5, 8 to 16, 19 to 36 and 39 and 40. All of those amendments are in respect of advance instalments, of which I have spoken during the second reading debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The vote effectively to defer this legislation, requesting that the government rewrite the legislation taking into account the criticisms that were listed, was defeated. We made it clear what would occur if it were defeated and if the government were not prepared to reconsider the various types of issues, including the advance instalment issue. That was not our first option; we would have preferred the government to have listened and to have rewritten the legislation. But that has not happened. That having failed, Labor will now attempt&mdash;hopefully with the assistance of other parties and the Independents in the Senate&mdash;to rewrite some of the more iniquitous provisions in this package of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make one point at this particular stage of the debate about the collection mechanism. We started to rewrite the collection mechanism about two to three weeks ago. We got a further set of amendments from the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government&mdash;and I have to say that the continual government amendments subsequently made that rewriting more difficult. An attempt to redraft the collection mechanism would have meant redrafting the seven bills in very substantial ways&mdash;in fact, a total rewrite&mdash;and could have meant some 400, 500 or 600 amendments. It would have been a massive number of amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our preferred option was that the government would withdraw the bills, rewrite them and reconsider the collection mechanism. That has not happened. That is lost, and we accept that. That is on the government's head. We would have preferred the government to have rewritten the collection mechanism. We were unable to rewrite the collection mechanism, given the massive number of amendments that were required, because we do not possess the same resources as government in terms of drafters. I requested from Senator Kemp access to drafting staff. That was not forthcoming. I do not imply a criticism of Senator Kemp in that because his refusal to meet that request was based on the sheer volume of work. We understand that, but that is part of the problem in dealing with these bills. We think the rushing and the volume of work are unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons, we have not attempted to rewrite the collection mechanism. As I have said, it would have been a massive job. It is the government's role to do that. We urge the government to do that. It is not our job to rewrite the collection mechanism.</PARA>

Half a billion dollars is at risk. If we had been able to start at 8 o'clock, maybe we would have got through the amendments substantially and been in a position to conclude them tonight. I do think that is unfortunate for the simple reason&mdash;and I say this quite frankly&mdash;that industry want to know what the final position will be. They want to know that. We are not going to abrogate our right and responsibility to deal with significant amendments&mdash;and these are significant amendments&mdash;in a reasoned way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as Labor is concerned, the advance instalment provisions of this legislation represent one of the most atrocious elements of the government's legislation. If an individual has to halve the 15 per cent tax, the advance instalment provisions require the individual to pay the following year's tax liability in advance. It assumes that an individual will have an ongoing taxation liability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make a few other comments about this issue. What the government is trying to do is bring forward its revenue through this advance instalment. Of course, the effect of pushing back the dates that the surcharge debt from 1996-97 is payable by, in conjunction with the advance instalment, led to one outcome: a huge amount of revenue being collected in the year 1999-2000. I would hate to suggest that the government is fiddling the numbers, but that is exactly what the government is attempting to do. The government is seeking to raise the maximum amount of revenue in 1999-2000 that it possibly can.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, nothing particularly exciting is happening in the year 1999-2000. I do not know whether any of the senators can think of anything that is due in 1999-2000 and why the government would want all the additional revenue because of the effects of the advance instalment. It may just be that&mdash;I think&mdash;there is an election scheduled, but maybe I am not sufficiently cynical to believe that the government wants to boost its revenue in that year because there is an election scheduled.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. I am trying to avoid the provocation. It does not hurt the government that a large part of the revenue that would have been raised in 1996-97 will not now be collected until 1997-98, thereby inflating the bottom budget line in that year as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition also notes that the government does not propose to insert a line item in the budget statements indicating the amount of money that the commissioner has to refund due to the incorrect collection of moneys. The opposition would note strongly that, should our amendments on advance instalments fail, the government should be required to put this liability to refund Australians' superannuation moneys with interest as a separate line item in the budget, particularly if the government is true to its promise of budget honesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will move on to the equity issues that the advance instalment provision raises. How can this be a fair tax on superannuation when individuals who should not be required to pay the tax in the first place are required to pay an advance instalment? Senator Kemp has been very cautious with his words. He says not one person need pay the 15 per cent tax if they all provide their tax file numbers, but 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2622"> we know that not everyone will provide their tax file numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you ask a superannuation fund how many are likely not to provide their tax file numbers, they will tell you it will be at least a million in the first year, which means that they will not only be hit by the 15 per cent tax, they will also be hit by the additional advance instalment of 7&half; per cent. Given that these are likely to be low income, part-time, casual or itinerant workers who fail to provide their tax file numbers to the superannuation fund&mdash;either because they are unaware of the requirement to do so or because of the inability of the fund to contact them&mdash;they will pay the total tax in the first year of 22.5 per cent. These are people who should not be paying this so-called surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kemp will not assure the Senate that not one person who earns less than $70,000 will have to pay the tax. He will assure the Senate that not one of them need to, but he will not assure the Senate that not one person will have to. He knows the evidence; he knows what the reality is out in the industry.</PARA>

Senator Kemp continues to say that people earning less than $70,000 need not have to pay the tax, but all the evidence before the committee&mdash;never refuted by anyone&mdash;says that hundreds of thousands, a million or maybe more, people who earn less than $70,000 will have to pay the tax because, for various reasons, they do not provide their tax file number. That is a 15 per cent tax and another 7.5 per cent advance instalment. That is a total of 22.5 per cent tax on top of the existing 30 per cent tax.

We believed that that was appropriate, but it has consequences. It was a very long debate. It took a lot of the Senate's time and everyone here knows it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have a situation where you have unparalleled incompetence in terms of the management of a legislation program. You might get up and say, `Senator Campbell is very inexperienced. He is new to the job.' Okay, he is and we accept that anyone in that situation is likely to make mistakes. We are surprised at the number of mistakes that Senator Campbell has made, but it is understandable that he is not across his brief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unprecedented to have a situation where the government's orders of the day change literally on an hourly basis; that the red that comes out in the morning is meaningless. It may as well be printed on toilet paper for all its use. This is the performance of the Manager of Government Business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation where this opposition and this Senate have given a newly elected government more time and more opportunity to deal with the legislation program than has, in the life of the 13 years of Labor in government, ever been extended by the Liberals in opposition. One rule for them, one rule for us. No, we play ball&mdash;we have just allowed an extra three sitting days before the next budget to deal with your program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do need to respond to a number of matters that have been raised. We have seen over the past week in particular a game that became quite clear to me towards the end of last year when the Labor Party played it. When I summed up the end of the sittings before Christmas&mdash;as you will recall, Madam President, because you sat in the chair&mdash;I was quite magnanimous and thanked the opposition and other senators for the cooperation we received.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner said that he was sitting to our program. I must say that you can only have a program in this place that is agreed to by all senators. Yes, the adjournment time originally was set at eight o'clock. Senator Faulkner said that we proposed 12 o'clock and I called him a liar and I have withdrawn that remark. It was unparliamentary and I should not have said it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I get angry when someone walks in here saying such things, knowing full well what the truth is&mdash;that is, we went to the opposition this morning and said, `We are not going to be able to finish these programs'&mdash;having taken 15 of those important bills off the program&mdash;`We will bring it down to five or six keys bills, including superannuation and a number of matters that have been dealt with today.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We said that we will need to put the question for the adjournment when a minister moves it so that we have flexibility. The opposition came back and said, `No, we can't have an open&hyphen;ended adjournment because that does not give anyone certainty. We will make it 12 o'clock.' I am giving away private conversations here, but I believe I can do that be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cause the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Faulkner) has misled the Senate in relation to those discussions and those negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All senators need to understand and anyone who is silly enough to be sitting up listening to this needs to understand what the Manager of Opposition Business has done. I do look forward to Senator Carr speaking if he gets the call, because what I am about to tell you is what happened. He can deny it. He came to me and said, `We need to have a definite time for the adjournment tonight and that should be 12 midnight. But what we will do is talk to you about it as we get closer to that time. Of course, we are not wedded to 12 o'clock, we are not restricting it to 12, we are just saying you need to have a cut&hyphen;off for the debate and we will talk to you about it as it gets closer.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it got closer to 12, we had discussions about these matters. As Senator Kemp would know, being a previous manager of government business, you talk about these things. We went to them at 8 o'clock and said, `We are trying to get on with things and we have just got to flick Hindmarsh through.' We were told by the opposition senators that should only take 10 minutes after dinner. We were very keen to bring superannuation on straight after dinner. Senator Herron had been told&mdash;what was it&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, Senator West, but maybe you can take the New South Wales Labor right at their word. When they say `mate' to you, maybe you can take them at their word. But I have to tell you that the socialist left from Victoria and possibly the New South Wales left are a different matter. When Senator Carr says, `Come and talk to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2636"> us about midnight and we will be cooperative about getting rid of the adjournment,' he really means, `Hang on; sorry, no, I do not think we said that.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Carr, I look forward to your explanation, because when it came to 12 o'clock not only could we not even bring the superannuation bills to a vote but we could not allow honourable senators who have been elected by the people of Australia to decide whether we negate the adjournment. Senator Carr and Senator Sherry would not even allow senators to make a decision. They said, `We will talk about negating the adjournment at midnight so that we can get the legislation finished,' but when it came to it they would not allow us to debate it or have a vote. That is what we are dealing with here. As a great Western Australian and former Premier said, `Never shake hands with a cobra,' because obviously you get your hand bitten off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Could I just say that the current Leader of the Opposition (Senator Faulkner) said that he had given the coalition an extra 121 hours. I will table this document: it shows that one of the reasons that we have problems in this place is that every time the opposition give us an hour of extra of extra time they take it back. When it comes to managing government business and trying to be cooperative, they are the great Indian givers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you want to know how many hours you took on four bills? In the relatively short time since last October, do you know how long it has taken these guys to deal with four pieces of legislation? Endless speeches on second reading debates, endless committee stages. For example, take the RSA bill that you handled this week, Senator Kemp: we were told, `An hour and a half should knock that off, no worries.' There was no objection from Senator Carr, no objection from Senator Faulkner, about the length of time it would take to deal with retirement savings accounts. Senator Sherry said, `Yes, an hour or two; no worries.' Two hours go by, four hours go by, six hours go by, eight hours go by&mdash;and we get it. How many hours for four bills, four pieces of legislation? One hundred and eleven hours. You give us 121 and take back 111. These guys are generous. Indian givers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to extra sitting hours, earlier today Senator Faulkner said, `Look, these guys do not know what they are doing. If you want to get business done, you have to get extra time at the end of the sittings.' So we went to them last week and said, `Do you think we could get a couple of extra days at the end of the sittings if we don't get our business done? Could we come back for a couple of days after Easter?' `Oh no, you cannot come back for a couple of days after Easter&mdash;we are all going overseas. We have got a two for one offer with Qantas. We are not going to be here. So you are not going to get any days like that.' So we go to them and say, `We cannot get extra sitting hours tonight, we cannot sit through until 2 or 3 in the morning like we used to do every year when we were in opposition. We cannot do that, that is out of the ballpark.' So we say, `Could we please have an extra week before the budget sittings?' They say, `You cannot have a whole week. You can come back for a day or two if you are lucky.' We have got three days. You see, we were silly because we should have asked for time at the end of these sittings to get our bills done. We were told we were stupid; we were told we were moronic. We were told that we just did not know what to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the Senate that we actually have that figured out. I may be new, I may be inexperienced; I will give you that. But I am learning pretty fast. I tell you what, a number of people from Senator Faulkner's own side have come to me and said, `Ian, you are doing a very good job managing government business&mdash;better than Senator Faulkner ever did&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing we heard today was, `Why didn't you bring super on earlier?' Senator Sherry did not have his amendments ready until after the second reading stage yet he said, `Bring on super.' You saw the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> this morning, Madam President. We had the disallowance motions on industrial 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2637"> relations. We were told that would take 10 minutes. It could have been dealt with in May but we had to deal with it today. That took half an hour. Then we had eight motions in relation to the Deputy President of the Senate, the person they voted in as Deputy President in 1990. We spent two hours this afternoon dealing with their little vendetta against Senator Colston. They said, `Let us bring on super after lunch.' What did we do after lunch? We spent hours on their old mate Senator Colston, the Deputy President. We were happy to deal with superannuation straight after lunch, but what did they want to do? Not talk about legislation that will help make Australia's economy fairer for the battlers. We spoke right through until dinner time about matters that the opposition put onto the program. After dinner we were told, `We will knock off Hindmarsh and we will knock off health. It will only be a quick one, flick it through, off to the Reps and you will be onto super within half an hour.' At 10 o'clock we get onto super.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So do not come in here and tell us that we do not know how to manage the program. You guys cannot be taken seriously. We cannot shake hands with you guys because we all know what happens when you look us in the eye and say, `Don't worry, trust me, Ian; trust me, Senator Campbell. We will come and talk to you about midnight, about being reasonable and sitting for a couple of extra hours to get super done, to get health done and to get the message on Hindmarsh dealt with.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They did not want to do Hindmarsh. They are split down the middle on Hindmarsh. The shadow minister in the other place is saying, `We can't have this,' Senator Collins over here is saying, `We need it, we are going to flick it through.' They are divided down the middle. They do not want to deal with Hindmarsh. The  filibustering on the other side I can understand&mdash;they do not want to deal with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Beazley is totally embarrassed because he promised the Australian people that we would deal with Hindmarsh, and with no amendments. You cannot deal with these guys; you cannot look them in the eye. They 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cannot tell you truth. They say, `We are so cooperative; we will give you 121 hours'; then they spend 111 hours&mdash;the second longest debate in Australian history&mdash;on industrial relations. They have the third longest debate in Australian history on Telstra. There is a blow&hyphen;out of 100 per cent in relation to telecommunications and we spent nearly eight hours on RSA. These guys are not serious. Gary Gray has got it right; Bob Carr has got it right.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short time that is remaining, I think I should state a few basic facts. It is in fact 125 hours and six minutes that this opposition, along with other members of the Senate, agreed to, in terms of extra time for this government to consider their legislative program. If you average it out at three hours per day, it equals 40 extra days of sitting or, if you work on the assumption that the average parliament sits some 80 days, that is, in effect, an extra six months in a parliamentary cycle, an extra 10 weeks of parliamentary time provided to this government for consideration of their program&mdash;a program, I emphasise, that is fundamentally different from the program they actually put to the people in the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They went into the election on the basis that they were seeking to secure a mandate for minimal changes. What we saw after that election was a program that actually promised maximum changes&mdash;such as in industrial relations, where they said that people were not going to be worse off, or in superannuation, where they said there were going to be no extra taxes. What do we see? We see a program that introduces massive increases in taxation. We see a whole series of areas, such as the ABC, education, industrial relations and telecommunications, where there are fundamental changes in the structure of Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been 125 hours extra time for you to pursue your agenda. The problem has not been Senate obstruction; it has been mismanagement. What I indicated to you,

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) A principal obligation of the Australian Government under the Ramsar Convention is to ensure that the ecological character for which Ramsar listed wetlands were recognised, are protected. The Commonwealth Government will be maintaining a role in any consideration of the future management of Coongie Lakes to ensure these obligations are met. In particular the National Wetlands Program is providing funds to the South Australian Department of Environment and Natural Resources to prepare a management plan for the Coongie Lakes Ramsar site and it is a requirement of the Commonwealth that this be prepared in accordance with the Ramsar Convention's wise use guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coongie Lakes are not World Heritage listed although there has been some identification of world heritage values. The commonwealth believes that respecting the Ramsar values is sufficient in these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Commonwealth has provided some comments in relation to the Draft Declaration of Environmental Factors and Draft Code of Environmental Practice&mdash;Seismic Operations, provided by Santos under cover of the Departmental Secretary's letter of 14 February 1997 and asked a series of further questions. The Commonwealth will continue such involvement in the process as is necessary and ensure it meets its obligations under the Ramsar Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The letter further noted that the environmental impacts of any subsequent stage, involving exploratory drilling and possible development of petroleum deposits, will require close attention by the Commonwealth at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The final report is due to be submitted in September 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Funds which have been allocated to South Australia from the National Wetlands Program for the Coongie Lakes Management Plan have been provided, in accordance with normal practice, on the condition that the management plan when completed must be consistent with the Ramsar Conven 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion's obligations, particularly with the Guidelines on Management Planning for Ramsar sites, the Guidelines for Implementation of the Wise Use Concept of the Convention and the recommendation on zonation within wetland reserves, as developed by the Ramsar Convention. The Program also specifies that the draft management plan must be prepared in consultation with all interest groups and released for public review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Further Commonwealth action on the majority recommendations of the Lake Eyre Basin Reference Group is awaiting the conclusions of a study on the indigenous cultural World Heritage values of the Lake Eyre Basin in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) See answer to question 5.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Is the Minister aware that there is widespread opposition to this proposed compulsory amalgamation from Aboriginal communities, especially in the Kimberley region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Does the Minister accept the view of Kimberley Aboriginal resource agencies which see this forced amalgamation of CDEP projects as leading to a dramatic shift of administrative paper work from ATSIC itself onto already overextended Aboriginal resource agencies; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Is the Minister prepared to allocate to ATSIC the necessary resources for it to continue administering the CDEP, the `work for the dole' scheme to Aboriginal communities, rather than force the transfer of this administrative burden from ATSIC to the Aboriginal resource agencies.</PARA></QUESTION>
