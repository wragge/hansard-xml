<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am rising to speak on the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill 1997. It is a complex issue but I would like to start by saying that retirement savings accounts are promoted as choice. We believe they are not choice; they are effectively the same thing as other superannuation vehicles&mdash;that is, a requirement that workers reduce their disposable income in an effort to ensure that government can in the future reduce its obligation in respect of older people. It is a further step in the dismantling of the universal pension. That step began under Labor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the extent that retirement savings accounts are different from other vehicles for obligatory self&hyphen;funded retirement investment, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they are different because they send this obligatory income reduction to banks rather than to other financial institutions. They are also different in that in most superannuation funds the investments are under at least some minimal control of some group at least theoretically representing the contributors. RSAs, retirement savings accounts, represent investment that is not transparent and which is determined by banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is then a rather transparent attempt to curry favour with banks by giving them a cut in the large $260 billion pool of superannuation funds, a pool that is growing at a rate of $25 billion to $30 billion a year. Banks are increasingly large transnational organisations. Investment in the banking sector is open to international players now. Increasingly, even those banks whose character is presented as `Australian' have substantial investments, including ownership of banks abroad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ownership of foreign banks often entails a management structure where foreign interests are directly represented and funds are freely transferred and invested in any nation and assets collected in this nation may be lent in any nation. The interests of management in such banks may be totally divorced from the interests of Australia, Australian investors, Australian industry or the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alternatively, superannuation companies are also large concentrations of capital but still predominantly national in nature. Even so, it is a concern to the Greens (WA) that superannuation funds are increasingly investing in large corporations and increasingly investing overseas. This goes with the computer formula for investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An important difference is that, with superannuation funds, the fund members have put some input into the investment regime of most funds, even if that is through representatives on fund management committees. With RSAs the banks have complete discretion as to the investment of RSA contributor funds. Any control lies solely in the decision to contribute to an RSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another more basic issue lies with disclosure of investment and investment strategy where complying superannuation funds are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2344"> required under the SIS regulations 2.29 and 4.09 to provide information about investments and investment strategies to members. Senator Sherry would certainly remember that this was a commitment that he agreed to in a debate about three years ago in relation to superannuation funds, that people should have the right to know where their portfolios are invested in superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">RSAs seem to have no equivalent requirement. Not only do people have no power over their investment, they may find it difficult to determine the nature of those investments. It is therefore of concern when the main report, on page 49, seems to perceive disclosure issues as relating solely to fees, charges, rates of return and such issues outlined under 3.64. The Democrats, on page 62 of the committee report on this bill, welcome the statement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) that disclosure regulations for RSAs will be `quite similar' to those of superannuation funds. Given the lack of disclosure for compulsory funds, and the fact that under section 51 of the act RSA membership may be effectively compulsory, I am not so reassured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many respects, if compulsory savings programs along the lines of RSAs are the choice of parliament, we would prefer to see perhaps credit unions used as a vehicle, since depositors are voting members. There are effective size limits and some means at least of regional control, and investment patterns by credit unions tend to direct capital to small and medium, locally and regionally owned businesses which provide the majority of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a continual call from the Greens to assure a greater level of choice in obligatory retirement savings schemes. However, the focus of choice is not on which financial institutions can make similar investments but on the choice of investment targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Particularly, we support options which support the Australian economy and employment within an ethical context. We have several times pursued options within superannuation funds for: investment in locally or regionally owned small or medium business; ecologically sustainable investment; non&hyphen;military oriented peaceful investment; and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> investment that does not exploit people from developing nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has also been a call from the Greens to recognise that obligatory investment programs such as compulsory superannuation or RSAs are not necessarily the best investment vehicle for workers, and that investment in such things as a small business or a home may provide more substantial and far&hyphen;reaching benefits. This goes beyond the direct benefits as financial investments and recognises that there may be substantial and ongoing human benefits in terms of use value of such investments and, in the case of investment in small business, in ensuring the capacity of older people to continue working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this year, there was a major uproar over the requirement that unemployed people over 55 utilise superannuation assets before being eligible for full unemployment benefits. How can this treatment of older workers be justified at the same time as workers are being required to contribute to superannuation funds or RSAs, ostensibly for their retirement, and to increase savings?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under legislation announced at the last budget, from September 1997, those applying for unemployment or other benefits who are above the age of 55 are given a different status from those other unemployed people and expected to utilise their savings, including superannuation savings, before becoming a burden on the taxpayers. This is normally an exempt asset for younger unemployed people. Not only are assets tested; more perniciously `deemed income' is assessed. In other words, if a superannuation fund earns real or `deemed' interest, this is counted as income, and it comes off unemployment benefits at a rate of 50c in the dollar. This utterly undermines any rhetoric in relation to savings and self&hyphen;funded retirement, showing it to be sheer hypocrisy on the part of government. The cost to savings and self&hyphen;funded retirement was predicted in the last budget as in excess of $44 million per year, taken from the superannuation of unemployed people aged 55 to 65.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">RSAs are being promoted both as an increase in choice and as a means of protecting small retirement contributions made compulsorily by employers or perhaps by employees 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2345"> if that aspect of the Labor tax&hyphen;break promise goes ahead. Reading from the papers this morning, we have still to see what is going to happen there. Under section 51, RSA legislation can allow companies to open retirement savings accounts for employees without their consent. This effectively echoes the type of superannuation funds where membership in a specific fund is compulsory. It is not consumer choice. It just allows companies to make deals with a bank, in competition with a superannuation fund. It may mean that employees are forced to support a transnational bank instead of being forced into a certain superannuation fund. This is of particular concern, given that it has been acknowledged that retirement savings accounts are likely to provide lower returns than superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995, small accounts cannot be duplicated&mdash;there can be only one account&mdash;and notification must occur when accounts reach $1,200, when workers are advised to transfer the amounts to a real superannuation fund. Contrast this to the retirement savings accounts where notification and suggestions&mdash;not compulsions&mdash;to transfer to superannuation funds do not occur until accounts reach $10,000. Contrast this with the mechanisms allowing multiple RSAs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens (WA) are fundamentally opposed to RSAs as: unnecessary; failing to provide any significant benefit or choice; likely to create situations where workers are compelled to support RSAs; and creating an investment vehicle that is more likely to be counterproductive to the interests of the Australian economy than to provide either jobs or ecologically or socially sustainable development. Nonetheless, we support the majority of Labor and Democrat amendments as minor improvements to a bill which, from what we can see, is likely to pass with a nod from the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank senators for their contributions to the debate. Quite a range of issues were raised, some of which I think are better dealt with in the committee 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stage. We are keen to have the bill properly and fully debated. It is an important bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is a clear case of the government delivering on its election promises. We went to an election with a policy of allowing financial institutions such as banks, building societies and credit unions to offer retirement savings accounts for individual superannuation. RSAs are to be subject to the same retirement income and superannuation standards and will attract the same taxation benefits as traditional superannuation funds. The intention of introducing RSAs is not to replace existing superannuation funds but to complement existing arrangements by expanding the range of options open to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been foreshadowed by some speakers is a range of amendments which are clearly designed to undermine the attractiveness of RSAs as a superannuation product in the market. In this way, we believe that the opposition in particular is seeking to undermine the government's election commitment and, in some ways, to shore up the privileged position of superannuation funds. There were a number of statements which were made during the debate which were plain wrong and which were made with the clear and explicit purpose of justifying opposition amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just address a number of issues. Firstly, Senator Sherry raised the concern that employers will be able to open an RSA account on behalf of an employee and that this runs contrary to section 153 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, which requires employees to give their consent before a superannuation account can be opened by an employer.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is no such provision in section 153 of the SIS Act. Subparagraphs 153(1)(b)(i) and 153(2) allow a standard employer sponsor of the entity, being a superannuation fund, to make an application on behalf of a person being an employee. It does not require an employee to provide consent with that application. What we are proposing is consistent with section 51 of the RSA bill. On that matter Senator Sherry was wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second concern was raised that superannuation funds should be allowed to offer RSAs and that this was an omission from the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2346"> draft cabinet submission that was apparently leaked to Senator Sherry's office. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced in the budget that public offer superannuation funds will be able to offer a product similar to RSAs. However, they will still be sold under a trust structure and will be regulated under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no need for any amendments to be made to the RSA legislation to allow for public offer superannuation funds to offer these look alike RSAs. The necessary amendments will be made to the SIS regulations and this is the appropriate legislation to provide for look alike RSAs offered by public offer superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A third concern raised by a number of speakers was that RSAs should be protected from any reduction in the account balance by fees, charges or taxes. The government has no intention of amending the definition of capital guarantee in the RSA bill to provide that no fees and charges can be imposed on an RSA. The complete prohibition of fees and charges on RSAs would represent unwarranted commercial interference. In addition, it would be inconsistent with both the more commonly understood meaning of capital guarantee and the existing commercial practice in respect of traditional deposit arrangements and capital guaranteed life offer superannuation products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern was raised that RSA providers should not be allowed to offer special incentives to employees in return for having their employees open an RSA. Senator Sherry in his remarks believed that this practice would result in employees being coerced into remaining in an RSA to their detriment. This practice is commonly referred to as third line forcing. It is prohibited by the Trade Practices Act 1994 and the RSA bill provides a number of options for an employee if he or she does not wish to retain benefits in an RSA which has been opened by an employer on his or her behalf. We can debate some of those additional matters during the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry's fifth concern&mdash;and it is the concern of perhaps one or two others&mdash;was the need to have a series of so-called health 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> warnings concerning the longer term impact on superannuation benefits if a person remains in an RSA due to the lower returns when compared to a traditional superannuation fund. The government has recognised the need for consumers to be informed of the possible lower returns on these products and to this end it is intended that the RSA regulations will require RSA providers to inform people about the low risk, low return nature of RSAs and that other superannuation arrangements may provide a greater return in the long term. These matters again will be discussed during the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry has also raised a concern about the 14&hyphen;day cooling off period. Senator Sherry proposes that the cooling off period should be extended to 28 days. The 14&hyphen;day cooling off period is a feature of the SIS Act and the Insurance Contracts Act. Both these acts were introduced by the previous government and would appear to be acceptable to the consumer movement. The 14&hyphen;day cooling off period in the RSA bill is consistent with the equivalent provision in these acts. There does not appear to be any valid reason for making it different from these acts. Again, I make the point that this is another attempt to try to add extra burdens onto RSAs which are simply not imposed on other superannuation products in the superannuation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, these bills give effect to an election commitment. We take our election commitments seriously. We believe it is important that this bill be passed by the Senate. We believe that the bill as presented is a fair bill. It takes into account a large range of views which were expressed to the government and I urge the Senate to support the bill.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Firstly, I stress that we are not going to in any way try to unduly prolong the debate on the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill. I intend to make a number of points as briefly as I can about each of our amendments as we go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendments 1 and 4 go to the issue of any complying superannuation fund being able to offer the RSA product. It was very clear in the government's election manifesto&mdash;I will not seek to embarrass the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) by tabling it&mdash;that any complying superannuation fund would be able to offer RSAs. That is not in this legislation. We received a leaked copy of the cabinet document two weeks prior to last year's budget, and the provision that any complying superannuation fund could offer RSAs was in the cabinet recommendations. On budget night it was dropped out. We still do not know why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says that superannuation funds will be able to provide RSA look&hyphen;alikes. We believe that is unacceptable. The ability for superannuation funds to offer RSA look&hyphen;alikes is contained in the regulations. Another reason why this approach is unacceptable is that we have not yet been able to view the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of our continuing problems with respect to superannuation legislation from this government is a moving feast of both amendments and new bills and the difficulties in being able to determine in any detail, in the absence of regulations, very important aspects of superannuation legislation. This is one area where we have some concerns. We believe it is a serious problem for us to be debating these bills without regulations, or at least some idea about them. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp has stressed competitive neutrality. How can these bills create a level playing field when one sector of industry is excluded from offering the RSA product? We would contend that, effectively, what you are doing is giving banks&mdash;there are some other financial institutions, but it is largely the banks that this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legislation is benefiting&mdash;and not the traditional superannuation industry, if they so wish, the ability to offer RSAs. I certainly am aware that in some areas traditional industry will want to offer RSAs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those comments go to our amendments 1 and 4. I have looked at the Democrats' amendment. There is not a significant conflict in our approach. There is some relatively minor wording change, but I think we certainly are on the same track with the same principle. That is why we would urge the Senate to support our amendments; if not our amendments, the Democrats' amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

If the government is interested in a fully competitive superannuation scene, then this ought to be made available to superannuation funds along with banks, credit unions, insurance companies and the like.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the committee's attention to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, which says that several witnesses and submitters argued that existing superannuation trustees should be able to offer RSAs</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and, indeed, be able to use the term `RSA' as a product description. It says that the Investment Funds of Australia argued that there was no difference between an RSA and a cash based superannuation fund. They submitted that super funds trustees should `have access to the simpler and cheaper structure that is being proposed for RSAs' and that this was a very important aspect of competitive neutrality. ASFA also argued that to do otherwise would confuse consumers and provide RSA institutions with an unfair competitive advantage. The Democrats were certainly persuaded 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2348"> by those arguments put during the hearing on this subject.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the contributions to the debate on the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill. We are trying to keep this fairly brief. I note the offer that Senator Sherry made and the constructive approach that he has flagged in relation to this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will oppose the amendment which has been announced by Senator Sherry and supported by the Democrats. The government has announced that public office super funds will be able to offer RSA look&hyphen;alike products. Similar disclosure and other standards will apply for RSAs regulated under RSA regulations, and this policy will be implemented through the SIS regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policy should not be implemented through amendments to the RSA bill as the opposition and the Democrats have proposed. This is because the RSA bill deals with only non-trust based superannuation. If superannuation funds were referred to in the RSA bill, the funds would be subject to two regimes: the SIS regime and the RSA regime. They would need to lodge two annual returns, two audit certificates, to obtain approval. It would lead to increased compliance costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I am making is that we have announced that public offer super funds will be allowed to offer RSA look&hyphen;alike products. There is no argument on that score. Similar disclosure and other standards will apply for RSAs as regulated under RSA legislation. Only public offer funds can offer RSA look&hyphen;alikes because these are retail funds&mdash;in other words, funds marketing super funds for the general public. Complying funds&mdash;I think that was an issue raised by Senator Sherry&mdash;where they are regulated as public funds will be able to offer RSA look&hyphen;alikes through the SIS regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that covers the matters which have been raised. I urge the Senate to reject the amendments put forward by Senator Sherry. We believe they will be covered to the extent they can practically be covered in the regulations. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I just contend, Senator Kemp, that you are incorrect when you say that, if RSAs were extended to a complying superannuation fund, they would be subject to two regulatory regimes. Our advice from the industry is that that would not happen, because the complying superannuation funds would establish the RSA product separately to ensure that they are not covered by the two regulatory regimes, if that was indeed a problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, one of the great advantages of a complying superannuation fund having the ability to offer an RSA is that it is a low return product&mdash;no-one has disputed that&mdash;and if a person is in an RSA, a lower return product, and if that RSA is indirectly linked to a complying superannuation fund, a traditional fund, we would contend it would be easier for a member of an RSA to move their money when it is convenient to them out of the low return RSA product into a complying superannuation fund, which will carry a higher rate of return. We contend it would be easier practically to do that than it would be for a person in an RSA product offered by a bank to shift their money out of that RSA offered by a bank into some other product. We would argue that, practically, the individual in the RSA will find it easier to move their money into the complying superannuation fund, where the return is greater.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would contend that it is in a bank's best interests to ensure as much money is locked up in a low return RSA type product because it is to the bank's financial advantage to do so. Whilst the bank can issue a health warning or various advice to a member in an RSA bank product that it is to their disadvantage, I do not believe they will pursue that approach with any enthusiasm whatsoever, because RSAs will become for banks effectively like the old passbook account&mdash;a very low interest product that the banks will seek to obtain the maximum return on by reinvesting the money, albeit it has to be in a capital guaranteed product. So we really cannot understand your opposition, Senator Kemp, on practical grounds and on principle grounds. It 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2349"> is in the best interests of RSA members to end up with a RSA product with a complying superannuation fund who offers the product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point is that it is consistent with your election commitment but somehow between the cabinet submission before the budget last year it slipped out. You have given us some reasons, but I will not ask you what happened in cabinet. I suspect the banks had a word to the Treasurer in the meantime, but I do not want to be unduly provocative.</PARA></SPEECH>

The minister says that there will be additional compliance costs, and Senator Sherry points out that this is unlikely. I make the point that, if there are, the superannuation funds themselves can decide whether that makes it viable or not viable. If the government is talking about commercial interference, this is a case in point. The government wants to interfere in order to protect, if you like, the superannuation funds from themselves if it is worried about the costs that might be applied. I suggest that is not a reasonable argument against these amendments.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

You disputed the advice that I gave to the Senate. Naturally, I went back and sought further advice to ensure what had been said was correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your amendment is to the definition of RSA institutions. Therefore, they would have to be subject to approval under the bill. This means they would have to be approved twice. The compliance problems which I raised with you would apply. So the first point I would make is that there is a legal problem with the issue that you have raised.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I'm sure you would. Yes, they will be subject to the retirement savings legislation if they offer an RSA product, but they will so structure their product that they will not be subject to two regimes. Even if they do not structure their product, even if they make the choice not to structure their product to be subject to the two regimes, and even if they decide that they are going to be subject to the two regimes, depending on how they decide to structure their product, the point made by Senator Allison is valid: that is a choice that they make and a cost they choose to bear if it is commercially viable to offer the product.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I make, Senator Kemp, is that you have raised this issue of dual legislative coverage. There are other places in this legislation where banks are required to be subject to the jurisdiction of this legislation as well as other superannuation legislation. So if your concern is about dual legislative coverage and competing costs, I would  contend that you have got a problem with this legislation in respect of banks being subject to the same sorts of problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is a commercial decision for the institutions offering RSAs to make. If it is too costly, they will not offer the product, but my advice&mdash;certainly from the funds we have consulted&mdash;is that it is not going to be a problem. Where they choose to offer an RSA, they will bear whatever the cost is regardless of the legislative framework that they are subject to. What they want is the right, as banks have, to make that choice.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I just pick up a point that Senator Sherry made because maybe he does not quite understand the significance of the difference between an RSA and what he referred to as `a capital guaranteed fund'. It is important to note that a capital guaranteed fund does not, in a technical sense, guarantee the capital in the fund. The reason is that the capital guaranteed funds work by retaining either a portion of the dividend which is paid, or a portion of the notional capital gain in a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reserve account. They use that to guarantee the fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not correct to say that a capital guaranteed fund, so structured, can meet the criteria of an RSA, and there is a very good reason for saying that. If you get into a period when you do not have sustained growth or you have a situation where you have a fund which is only recently constructed and you get into a period when the market starts to decline, it may well be the case that the reserve fund is exceeded. If you have a spate of redemptions from the fund, you will have that technical problem, and I think that should be recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kemp has said that the government is quite happy to allow superannuation funds to offer look&hyphen;alike products, but I think that you have got to be very careful when you refer to capital guaranteed funds and capital stable funds, which use fixed interest products as an alternative to RSAs. One of the problems with fixed interest products is that the government bond in which they invest can actually move up and down in value and that can create some technical difficulties, too. So I do not think it is correct to say that a capital guaranteed fund can be a replacement for the RSA structure.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that the statement has been received very positively by the small business community, as has been demonstrated by the statements of various industry representatives. It is heartening that business is recognising that it finally has a government that is sensitive to its interests and concerns, recognises how important it is to creating wealth and providing employment and appreciates that there is a role and responsibility for government in assisting in sensible ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the Housing Industry Association Ltd put out a statement yesterday saying that the HIA welcomes the initiatives in the Prime Minister's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business</EMPHASIS> statement which will significantly reduce the paperwork and compliance burden for small business. This is very important because we have heard so often that small business is overwhelmed by the paperwork and red tape requirements. Here is the HIA saying that this statement, as implemented, will `significantly reduce the paperwork and compliance burden for small business through liberalisation of FBT and unfair dismissal requirements'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the Senate that the HIA represents some 30,000 firms in the building industry&mdash;not an insignificant player, Senator Cook, although you might not appreciate it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast, the response from the Labor Party has been muddled. Senator Cook was not quite sure what he said on it yesterday morning. In fact, he had to put out a press release saying that he did not say what he thought he might have said. He said at today's door stop:</PARA>

Eventually we will keep the education process going. Senator Murray is asking a question on interest rates and I will come to that question. Before I do, let me make the point that Senator Murray has come in here day after day asking questions on manufacturing. As I said, I encourage it. The more we have those questions, the better. I do not mind that sort of pressure; I think it is great. Keep the pressure on us&mdash;that is good.</PARA></TALK.START>

Twenty&hyphen;six per cent of all emissions come from the manufacturing industry. You want to hit them with a carbon tax. You come in here making remarks to me about interest rates. Let me mention interest rates. The interest rates in Australia today are the lowest that they have been for years and years and years. Of course, they do reflect the low inflation factor that is going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the amount of money paid by small business, Senator Murray comes from the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2365"> small business sector and he would appreciate that that is very much a variable figure. Naturally, we would like to see interest rates down lower. However, it does reflect to a large degree the levels of risk. I would imagine that Senator Murray got a pretty good interest  rate, although he was there when the Labor Party was in power and the interest rate was over 20 per cent. Of course, that was the time when we saw the small business sector actually decimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I can say to Senator Murray is that there is no doubt in our view that we want inflation to stay down. We want to have a business environment that encourages investment and the way to achieve that is to make sure that we maintain the low level of inflation that someone said is the lowest since man stood on the moon. In fact, our interest rates are lower than they have been for a decade and we would like to see them lower.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the senator for his question.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us come to the issue of Green Corps, which is the central point of the question. Senator, I think I have explained to you before that the Green Corps is not a labour market program. It is a program designed to

Additionally, it provides for those Green Corps participants who might want to continue in a further form of training a cash benefit incentive to do so. That is the purpose of the Green Corps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that, in the earlier stages, one might have thought that the Green Corps program would take in a more limited range of people than we have agreed to take. As you know, we have agreed to take people whether they are employed or unemployed. I support that decision. It is a sensible decision to make because the main purpose of and desire for the Green Corps, as I have just outlined to you, is to contribute to enhancing and protecting the environment, to get accredited training in that area and to proceed to further training. This is not something that is limited to the long-term unemployed at all. Nor should the program, therefore, be limited to those people. In fact, it is open to those who choose to participate. It is voluntary participation in the program. I hope that answers your questions.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Minister, are you concerned that the ethanol industry received a blow when your government axed the ethanol fuel bounty, effectively pulling the rug out from a viable Australian industry which has created regional jobs and significant value adding to primary production? Guarantees were given at the time that, despite the withdrawal of the bounty, $2 million would go to the ethanol industry. The industry is now alarmed to hear that the money has since been moved into the Energy Research and Development Corporation to fill a budget hole, with no guarantee the money will be moved back. Minister, can you give a guarantee that the money will be redirected to the ethanol industry without delay, or is the government planning to throw this industry on the scrap heap altogether?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Woodley has asked a whole range of questions. I must say that I am totally amazed that you would resurrect the discredited ethanol bounty after what happened to your people in estimates last year. The Senate may recall what happened in, I think, the 1993 budget. As a deal between the Democrats and the past Labor government, to pass legislation through, the government agreed to introduce an ethanol bounty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was found on a proper scientific investigation that the ethanol bounty scheme was a failure on all counts. I could not help but 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2367"> notice either pre or post the last budget that Senator Kernot said they would support any move that had shown something had not worked&mdash;or words to that effect. This was one that had not worked, and we had no option but to remove the ethanol bounty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ERDC had an amount of $2 million which remained in the budget to be matched by industry in regard to a pilot plant. We decided to hold off that amount of money until a research program being conducted by ERDC was completed, because it seemed pretty silly to go down the track of the pilot plant without the completion of the research program. If my memory serves me correctly, that research is due to be completed in either 1998 or 1999&mdash;one of those two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year cash reserves of the ERDC were taken back, and the amount that was going to be used for the plant which had been postponed was transferred to ERDC in case they needed it. I am led to believe&mdash;in fact, I was advised of this only a few days ago&mdash;that that money was in fact never taken up by the ERDC. It was not required for their ongoing programs. It will be earmarked and continue to be earmarked for the pilot plant at the completion of the research program.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that, as a result of the legislation that finally passed through the Senate last night, Australian consumers have a great deal to look forward to from the new telecommunications liberalised regime which will operate from 1 July. Indeed, it will certainly mean that we will see a lot more competition, particularly outside the capital cities. We are already starting to see that in places such as Ballarat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt it will occur. It is very clear that the United States experience has been that companies targeting particular regional areas have been able to come up with packaged telephony proposals. People who are telephone integrators who are able to offer one-stop facilities will no doubt apply the same strategies here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that some of the real benefits that flowed from yesterday's package will include the new price cap regime, which is where we had to save Senator Schacht from himself. Quite clearly, a weighted average cost approach is much more sensible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very regrettable that the opposition seems to have not the slightest interest in these matters. If Senator Faulkner thinks he has to get instructions from Ian Healy over there every time he goes out to bat, then quite clearly the Labor Party is exposed as a party bereft of any interest in real policy issues and is simply interested in gimmicks, in political gutter crawling, in trawling through the minutiae of the matters that they have been dealing with in recent times and not showing any sensible interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the political strategy on the part of Mr Healy over there involves simply trying to devise the latest one-liners and political gimmicks and not addressing these historic benefits, then I have no doubt that the Australian public will see the Labor Party for what it is: a party bereft of any interest in policy issues, not interested in the bush, not

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are all major initiatives. The right to untimed local calls being extended to include business, voice and residential data calls, and consumer consultation on industry codes of practice are very significant advances that will be very much to the benefit of consumers. I hope that the Labor Party will realise that they are going nowhere when they pursue all these other irrelevancies. They think that political strategy involves simply trying to distract the public's attention. They should not worry about these issues because these are what will make Australia great again. These are the things that can really open up the markets and provide jobs and opportunities for small business to ensure that the bush gets a fair go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that we will be able to get back to the real agendas and that we will not have any more of this cheap grandstanding and political gutter crawling all the time, relying on leaks, peddling all those matters that are designed to distract attention from your policy bankruptcy. The public will have no doubt about where you stand when it comes to the next election because you are wasting valuable time. You could be doing some policy work but you are not interested in it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Mansfield did was indicate that short wave is a declining technology. The figures quoted in that report, I think, underline that fact. As Senator Forshaw well knows, the department of foreign affairs has consistently declined opportunities to be forthcoming with funding to support the service. It ought to be quite clear that it is one thing to point to what the BBC world service does and to perhaps stand on the sidelines and say, `Wouldn't it be nice if we were able to maintain the status quo?' The fact is that it costs in excess of $20 million a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the ABC is to meet its budget reduction of $55 million, as you well know, the $28 million from the One ABC policy, announced in December last year, goes about halfway towards meeting that target. If you want to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> argue that somehow you ought to preserve Radio Australia in its entirety and, as a result, force the ABC to discontinue a number of programs, to slash and burn in regional Australia, to cut back dramatically on news and current affairs, then it is a very interesting set of priorities that you have, because I do not think the Australian public agree with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian public wants the Mansfield report adopted. It wants guarantees of entrenchment in relation to news and current affairs, rural and remote services and children's television. It wants all of those built into the charter, which you have consistently refused to do and which Mansfield says is well overdue. I am delighted that Senator Schacht has finally come around to the party. He is obviously having a big lie down after last night's debate. The fact is that the ALP has belatedly realised that the ABC is vulnerable unless the charter entrenches those sorts of protections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are going to entrench them, the money has to be there to deliver the goods. If you want to see Radio Australia preserved at the cost of $20 million, then you are inevitably going to force the ABC to get into slash and burn mode for the rest of its services. That is not what we want to see happen. That is not what the Australian community wants to see happen. Indeed, they want it fully protected. So you cannot have it both ways. You have to be a bit responsible. I am delighted you are chairing the committee, and it is a pity you could not get yourself a proper time frame that would have enabled you to give us some recommendations that were relevant to the budget.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. It is Radio Australia that is on shaky ground here because of the decisions of your government to rip $55 million out of the ABC budget. What you have done is you have given Radio Australia a death sentence and then said, `What do you want&mdash;death by hanging or death by a firing squad?' Minister, the point is that Minister Downer wrote to you on 2 February. Given that Mr Downer had already written to you on 2 February expressing his serious concerns, why did you&mdash;assuming you were aware of the letter&mdash;make the comments that you did on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS>  program on 16 March? Minister, did you read the letter from Mr Downer&mdash;and I point out that it is now available on the Internet so, if you would like to go surfing, you will find it there&mdash;or is it the case that you treated Mr Downer like the rest of your colleagues treat him; that is, you just did not take him or his letter seriously?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to accommodation, staff from the appropriate area of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet undertook a detailed examination of various accommodation options in the inner Canberra area, involving contact with all major real estate experts.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what happens? Last Thursday, the government rushes amendments into the House of Representatives to take care of the problem that Mr Rose QC had identified. The government rushes amendments into the House of Representatives to delete, amongst other areas, that clause 34 which goes to the heart of the problem of the constitutionality of the government's proposed new tax on superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the government do? Did they say, `Oh, we got it wrong. We are sorry.'? Did they publicly acknowledge that they accepted that the superannuation so&hyphen;called surcharge bills were defective constitutionally? No, they did it on the quiet. They rushed it in last Thursday and they did not put out any press release acknowledging that they had got it wrong. They had to rewrite their legislation to minimise its chance of being challenged in the High Court. That could have overthrown that new tax of half a billion dollars a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the first time there has been a major problem with this government's package of legislation. The package of bills was tabled on 13 February. We have had assurance after assurance from Senator Kemp, when he can answer a question, and assurance after assurance from Mr Costello, Mr Fahey and the Prime Minister himself that this legislation is okay&mdash;it is fair and it is reasonable. They continue to refute the arguments that we have put in criticism of the effects of this new tax legislation. They continue to say there is no major problem, it is fair legislation, despite the fact that we have been raising for some months what we believe are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2375"> quite legitimate criticisms of the legislation, in addition to the constitutionality issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kemp, I do wish you would stay and listen because if only you had listened after the bills were tabled on 13 February, if only you had listened to what we were advising and if only you would listen to what everyone else is advising. It is not just we, Senator Kemp, who have been raising problems about this new tax. It is everyone else in the superannuation community: the accountants, the lawyers and the superannuation funds. Everyone has been raising problems about this new superannuation tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, it is not the first time. The government rushed in additional bills to exempt federal judges after 13 February. They had discovered they had another problem. Then the second problem: they forgot to include the tax in its application to federal government employees. The third problem was that they had to rush in amendments to deal with the constitutional problems. And today we have identified a fourth major problem: in its rush, the government has neglected, or forgotten, because of its general incompetence to amend section 58 of the superannuation industry supervisory act. The effect of that is that employers will have to pay the tax themselves on defined benefit funds, or trustees will have to collect the tax on the earnings of all fund members in order to pay the tax.</PARA>

It is a matter of making sure that there is no constitutional challenge, because, where there is one opinion from the Attorney-General's Department, there are bound to be other legal opinions which would state a different point of view. For that reason, so as to remove any possible doubt about this legislation's constitutional

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these things have only been done in response to evidence that was given to our committee, evidence that was heard by the superannuation select committee when it was reviewing this legislation. Until Mr Rose had put that position&mdash;his opinion&mdash;to the committee, there had been no doubts expressed about the validity of the surcharge legislation in relation to the proposed clause 34. Mr Rose's opinion was no knockout blow as far as this legislation is concerned&mdash;none whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments must take every step to make sure that they do not leave themselves open to a challenge, whether that challenge succeeds or not. You have been in government before, Senator Collins and others, and you know yourself that you must take every precaution to make sure that you do not leave any chance or any option available for people to challenge any constitutional validity relying on an opinion.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that Senator Sherry can continue, day after day, as long as he likes with these points that he tries to raise. But in regard to the surcharge legislation and in regard to its validity, the action that the government has taken in making sure that it does not allow for any challenge to the constitutional validity of this legislation is the way that this government sees fit to go, because it does not want, at any stage, to leave a position open where there might be the slightest chance of anybody challenging this legislation or its constitutional validity.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> when the preselectors in the South Australian Liberal Party get to hear his sterling performance defending the indefensible, they will know they have a quality member to vote for!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I want to take up the issue of constitutionality. Senator Ferguson well knows that not only have the government capitulated to Dennis Rose's opinion but also they still have got to get, from the states, agreement, because they also have admitted in the press release of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) himself that they have constitutional difficulties with the states. They have not been able to get any agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Friday, we had the state premiers in town for the Premiers Conference. It ended again, as it had the year before, as a shambles&mdash;no agreement, no press release and no press conference at the end to announce that they had solved their problems with the unconstitutionality of taxing the state MPs, state judges and state public servants. Where is the big press release being waved around saying that they have fixed the constitutionality problems?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is disappointing to see the government's attitude to ASFA. I long remember the previous opposition complaining about how harsh our government was towards interest groups that they perceived to have been opposed to our position. Now, because the head of ASFA is a former member of this chamber, we have a vindictive campaign being run out by the government that she is just doing the Labor Party's bidding, and vice versa. What you have is the industry up in arms about this surcharge legislation. It is a joke. It is a shambles. The only defence that the government are prepared to trot out in this chamber is `It's just Sue Ryan.' It is a disgrace that they are not prepared to debate the issues and it is a disgrace that they want to personalise the serious constitutional flaws in this bill down to `It's just Sue Ryan doing the job for the Labor Party.' It is a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We come back to the tax file number question. We had evidence before the committee that as few as one per cent in some funds actually should incur the surcharge, with incomes over $70,000. At best estimates&mdash;the best estimate from all the people 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2377"> who came before the committee&mdash;30 per cent of tax file numbers could be collected in the first 12 months. AMP, a private organisation as opposed to an industry fund&mdash;Senator Ferguson, during the committee, suggested that industry funds needed to get closer to their members and that if they were closer to their members they would be able to collect the tax file numbers&mdash;gave evidence that the best they were going to do was 12 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means that an organisation like the TWU super fund, which made a submission to the committee, will have to keep an extra $7 million of members' funds in the cash part of their investment portfolio. That is way more than they would normally keep. They estimate that this will reduce returns to members by one per cent. That is right, senators. Each individual member of the TWU fund&mdash;I am one, I have to announce&mdash;will be one per cent worse off because of this surcharge legislation&mdash;that is, the 99 per cent who should never have to incur any cost.</PARA>

The fact is that the money will not have been in their accounts, so it has not been earning interest.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to support the motion moved by Senator Sherry to take note of Senator Kemp's answers to the questions put to him with regard to the superannuation tax. Quite clearly we are looking at a situation where the government has painted itself so firmly into a corner that it is now 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> trying quite desperate tactics to manoeuvre itself out of that corner. The first point that is worthy of making is that it has become clear that, in persisting with this ridiculous situation of calling the tax a surcharge, the government has got itself embroiled in a constitutional debacle. We are seeing it played out day by day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kemp today refused quite specifically to rule out any future changes to the act. He knew that the minute the government refused to call it a tax it would be stuck in a corner calling it a surcharge. The government has run into constitutional problems that it cannot get away from. The justification for this particular tax is, firstly, calling it a surcharge. They are calling it an `imposition upon higher income earners'. They are saying that that means it is somehow a fairer imposition and that it redistributes the wealth with respect to superannuation. I put this to the government: if your only justification for this tax is that it is more equitable for lower income earners, why is the price being paid by the very low to middle income earners who are currently participating in industry funds?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have just heard very clearly from Senator Conroy how this cost is transferred across all participants in an industry fund. It is borne by the low to middle income earners of that fund, not just the high to middle income earners. The key is in the process that the government is advocating to collect the tax: that process means that the super funds will do it themselves. The cost imposition upon the industry funds in collecting this tax will impinge on their ability to get the resources to get the letters out, and so forth. I know that one industry fund alone has estimated the cost at $300 million. The fact is that this high cost will spread across all the funds. Regardless of the issue of the cash reserve that Senator Conroy spoke about, returns to all members will be reduced by one per cent. Charges and fees to the funds may well have to be addressed to cover the cost imposition of implementing the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the scheme of things, you do not need to look much further to see what message is being sent to the general community about 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2378"> superannuation. It has already been pointed out today that one of the great successes of Labor's superannuation policy was its provision of a secure place for people to invest their money for their retirement. People could invest their money in industry super schemes and be confident that their income would not tampered with. This tax undermines consumer confidence in the superannuation product generally. Let us face it: super was always the bag of the higher income earners&mdash;they have always utilised superannuation. Labor took super to low and middle income earners. I have no doubt&mdash;this view was expressed by a number of witnesses at the superannuation select committee hearings&mdash;that higher income earners will find a way to avoid this tax, so once again the middle to low income earners who remain in the industry super schemes will be the ones who bear the burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who can blame the Australian community for starting to question the security of their investment in such funds when the government is showing quite clearly that it is prepared to fiddle around with the taxation rules on superannuation? In this case it might in respect to higher income earners, but what happens next? What happens when those higher income earners depart the funds and the middle and lower income earners are left carrying the burden? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), to a question without notice asked by Senator Murray today, relating to access to finance in the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I want to draw attention to a real problem we have had&mdash;that is, consistently, Senator Parer has not responded to both the intent and the content of the question. I will deal with the intent first. The intent of the Australian Democrats is to raise issues which are of fundamental importance not only to our constituency but also to larger constituencies within society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Today I raised the question of the interest rates that small business do not enjoy&mdash;in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> other words, the same competitive interest rates of large business. My concerns were prompted by an article which I saw in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> on 19 February 1997. That article listed the following 15 countries in the OECD: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States. You will recognise in those names some of the strongest and most sophisticated industrial countries in this world. Thirteen of those 15 countries had lower prime business lending rates than Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have identified that small business experiences interest rates of two to three per cent higher, on average, than large business. I do not believe that the government would not prefer small business to have lower rates. The problem that the government faces is that, whilst it is no skin off their nose for a small business to get a better deal on bank rates, it is skin off the nose of big business&mdash;namely, the banks. It is the banks who benefit from those high interest rates. It is also the banks which pour exceptionally large sums of money into the political donation coffers of the coalition parties. The consequence of that is that you have a conflict of interest. Whilst I accept that you do want to advance the interests of small business, you are unable to do so because of your ties with big business and, in this instance, banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am urging the government to do is to put your money where your mouth is. If you are genuinely concerned about small business and the issue which is of fundamental importance to them, as all surveys have shown, you should act and intervene through the Wallis inquiry and other mechanisms to force a lowering of real interest rates for small business. Small business fundamentally needs access to cheap and readily available finance. That is the issue. That is what I wanted a response to from Senator Parer. I did not get a response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to have regard to the fact that the government's very welcome announcement yesterday on a number of small business areas which matter to small business does not go far enough. It does not address any of the big 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2379"> ticket items. Every one of the big ticket items is where the coalition finds there is a conflict with big business. That is on the issue of finance availability, cost of finance, the franchising issue, the unconscionable conduct issue and the cuts to business programs. It is all about relationships which you have not yet had the courage to tackle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have shown as a government that you have a hard edge in some areas. We in the Australian Democrats are saying that you should pay attention to those areas which small business is crying out for, particularly the cost of credit, which you have not yet addressed. Whilst we warmly welcomed yesterday many of the aspects of your first small business package, we say to you that it is too limited, it does not go far enough and it does not attack the big business items which matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We regard the pricing by banks as having been predatory and continuing to be predatory for small business. We regard the control by franchisors over franchisees as predatory. We regard the collapse of the franchising code as absolutely dangerous to small business. We believe that petroleum markets continue to be rigged with the support of the coalition. We believe that the horizontal concentration in our society damages small business. We believe that the coalition support for the nature of trading hours is an abuse of small business. We believe that the commercial tenancy issues result in domination by lessors. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This report is the 23rd in a series of reports recommending that a right of reply be accorded to a person who claims to have been adversely affected by being referred to in the Senate. On 5 March 1997, the President received a letter from Dr Neil Cherry relating to remarks made by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) during question time the same day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The President referred the letter to the committee as a submission under privilege resolution 5. The committee subsequently received a substantive submission from Dr Cherry, which it recommends be incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. As the committee always reminds the Senate, in matters of this nature it does not judge the truth or otherwise of statements made by honourable senators or persons. Rather, it ensures that a person's submission, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2388"> and ultimately the response it recommends, accord with the criteria set out in privilege resolution 5. The committee again commends the right of reply procedure as an inexpensive and readily available remedy available to an aggrieved person. I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today in the Senate Dr Neil Cherry's right of reply has been tabled by the Privileges Committee, and it is to be incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . This right of reply has been afforded Dr Cherry after the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) called this highly credentialled, independent academic  scientists `a shameless charlatan' two weeks ago when Dr Cherry was here in Canberra. He was here for the purpose of addressing parliamentarians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to firstly point out to the Senate that this treatment of Dr Cherry was not some wild outburst by the minister. Rather, it is symptomatic of a mind&hyphen;set which is now reflected in an organised campaign by governments here and elsewhere and the telecommunications industry in order to deny that there might be any health effects of electromagnetic radiation. It is as reactionary as it is irresponsible, and it is irresponsible because it is insistently and ludicrously defensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I came to the Senate I expected to find a place in which minds would be open. I expected that parliamentarians would want to be as fully informed as possible on all manner of issues, and to some degree I think this is true. It is the basis on which the Senate operates. We take issues and legislation to Senate committees in order that we can be better informed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is it, then, that the matter of electromagnetic radiation and the research around the world which shows that it can affect human biology, even at extremely low frequencies, should raise such protests of denial? Why is it that scientists such as Dr Neil Cherry are so loudly decried? Why is it that Minister Alston chose to do this when he had not met Dr Cherry, he had not come along to hear what Dr Cherry had to say and, I must presume, he had not read the material from which Dr Cherry quotes? I also presume that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> he has not had discussions with eminent researchers around the world, as has Dr Cherry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Dr Cherry demonstrates by his reply, he is a totally independent academic scientist, employed by Lincoln University in New Zealand. He receives no financial support for his research other than his university study leave and his own personal resources. He cannot be accused of looking for funding, and he has nothing to gain from either his own work or the dissemination of material produced by other researchers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Cherry is nothing if not a serious, highly qualified scientist with an abiding interest in the protection of public health. In his answer not only does he prove his eminence in terms of scientific qualifications and their relevance to this area; he demonstrates without question his standing in the scientific community, both here and overseas. He is no more a snake oil merchant than Senator Alston is the magic fairy. Senator Alston said in this house that there was absolutely no evidence to support the scaremongering campaign that he thinks Dr Cherry and no doubt the Australian Democrats have been conducting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that there is an immense amount of published scientific research showing many non-thermal effects of radiofrequency/microwave radiation at the cellular level, including cell cycle alteration, calcium ion efflux, altered DNA synthesis, single and double strand DNA breakage, altered lymphocyte activity, altered cell membrane permeability, altered cellular signal transduction, to name but a few. I intend to keep the Senate informed on developments in this research from time to time, but there is already such a body of evidence that many weeks would not be adequate to outline the work that is already available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Electromagnetic radiation is shown to reduce the production of pineal melatonin, which is a clear and direct plausible mechanism for increased cancer risk, sleep disruption, chronic fatigue disorder and reduced immune system competence. Live animal experiments have found all of these cellular changes and many more. Senators should also know that the incidence of brain tumours and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2389"> breast cancers is increasing. Every year there is an increase of one per cent in brain tumours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the minister and this government is at all interested in the health and safety of Australians, it should be asking why. It should not be putting its collective head in the sand alongside an industry and refusing to examine the evidence which is before it. I encountered this kind of closed mind when I visited the Telstra Research Laboratory last year. Here I spoke to people who called themselves scientists but spent all their time defending a position and attempting to discredit anything which appeared to challenge that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am no scientist, but I can recognise a closed mind when I see one. Good science, and good government for that matter, is open. If one thing is true it is the axiom that the more we know the more we know we do not know. I suggest to the minister that he does not know it all, that none of us does. The only way to learn, however, is to be unafraid to learn the truth, to open your mind to new information. That may not be the way in which a barrister prefers to see the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Shifting one's view according to the evidence presented may not be Minister Alston's modus operandi, but I put it to senators that in government ministers have a greater responsibility than to defend their position or the status quo or a powerful industry. They have a responsibility to act in the interests of the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Cherry has been at all times dignified and generous in his reaction to the intemperate ravings of the minister. He says that the minister's problems have as much to do with the quality of the advice he receives as any other factor. He says the minister should look at his officials and the type of advice he is receiving. We need an open, constructive, scientific exchange&mdash;not the issue being taken into personality politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Cherry says the key point about the minister's outburst is that he had not challenged the science. Senator Alston should apologise to Dr Cherry. I suggest that the time has come to put aside party allegiances and petty politics, name&hyphen;calling and defensive positions, and to not just challenge the science 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but act with some urgency to see that the science is put into service in the interests of increasing our knowledge and making us as parliamentarians better able to act in the interests of all.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These statements not only suggest that the information I am distributing is of questionable scientific merit, but that I may receive an illicit benefit from doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am a totally independent academic scientist employed by Lincoln University in New Zealand, an institution which is held in very high regard, both nationally and internationally. I have received no financial remuneration for my research into EMR effects to date, in fact my recent international study tour was funded partly by my university's study leave fund ($9,000), partly by the conference leave fund ($2,448) and largely by personal finance raised through a mortgage on our house ($18,000). I have appeared for residents in the Environment Court and in many Resource Consent Hearings and received no remuneration, not even for travel costs in these cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">My biographical details</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three years ago when asked about this issue I openly and publicly stated that while I knew of no 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2390"> scientific evidence at that time to suggest adverse effects, I urged a precautionary approach, especially in relation to children, pregnant women, the frail elderly and the sick, since they would be more vulnerable than the average healthy adult to the effects of environmental contaminants and toxins.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now have nearly three decades of preparation including advanced education in classical physics at the University of Canterbury, involving electricity and magnetism, radiation physics, the effects of microwaves on the physical properties of crystals and the use of pulsed microwaves for probing the atmosphere through using weather radar systems. This has given me an understanding of the production and transmission of pulsed and modulated radiofrequency and microwave emissions from radio, TV and mobile phones and base stations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My research into air pollution began in 1972 at McGill University, Montreal. This, along with my research in climatology, involved the use of statistics which I later used in environmental epidemiological studies of the health effects of air pollution. This involved establishing statistically significant associations between exposure to atmospheric contaminants and increased risk of health effects. My research progression through Agricultural Meteorology (commenced in 1974) required the acquisition of biological understanding and concepts and my research into Human Biometeorology (commenced in about 1978) significantly increased my understanding of human physiology and brain function.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus, in 1994 I was very well placed to understand and integrate EMR research from physics, biophysics, biology, human physiology and epidemiology. What I lacked, and since have added, is an understanding of biochemistry. I have incorporated research into biochemistry for about 2 years, to complete the interdisciplinary suite of expertise required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My professional standing and academic integrity has been recognised through my university by progressive promotion on merit to the top of the Senior Lecturer scale. I was elected by my fellow NZ meteorologists to be founding Vice President of the Meteorological Society of New Zealand and I am currently the elected National Chairperson of the Australia/New Zealand Solar Energy Society. I have been an elected Fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society since 1969 and am a professional member of several other learned societies which require a high standard of scientific ethics and performance for maintained membership status.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Alston referred to a New Zealand Environment Court case of a mobile phone base station in which I was the scientific team leader on behalf of residents in opposition to the site. He stated that I, and my team, were discredited because the court allowed the site to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our team included Professor John Goldsmith, an internationally eminent Professor of Epidemiology from the Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Israel; and Associate Professor Richard Luben, University of California, Riverside and President of the International Bioelectromagnetics Society and member of several US federal standards committees. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">None </EMPHASIS> of my team was required to retract any of our evidence under sustained cross&hyphen;examination. The expert witness for the applicant, Dr Michael Repacholi, however, was required to step back from a number of his statements, including an admission about a critical piece of evidence, that was only presented "with tongue in cheek".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the base station was approved, it was subject to the tightest legally enforceable public exposure condition in the Western World, not exceeding 2 W/cm2 at the nearest dwelling. Our team welcomed this decision as a major step forward in the recognition of the appropriateness of limiting exposure to less than 1% of the current Australia/New Zealand public exposure standard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision stated that at this level (2 W/cm2) they knew of no evidence of adverse effects, "even a potential effect of low probability and high potential impact", but that the condition should be reviewed with the availability of new evidence. I have concentrated since that time on collecting, analysing and reviewing this new and unpresented evidence in preparation for the next hearing of the Environment Court. It was a small portion of this evidence which I presented in my talk at Parliament House.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That item 4 of the Childcare Assistance (Fee Relief) Guidelines Variation (CCA/12A/97/1), made under the Child Care Act 1974, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In speaking to this disallowance motion, I first want to declare an interest. I am a consumer of quality child care services in that my youngest son attends a centre for a couple of days a week. I think it is appropriate that I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2392"> declare that interest. As a result of the government's initiatives, my fees have gone up recently in common with most child&hyphen;care consumers in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very proud of the record of the previous Labor government in relation to child care. The Labor Party provided good quality, affordable and accessible child care in developing its policies over 13 years. It recognised that families had different needs and that those needs must be met by different kinds of assistance. I think it is a very proud record. Ministers like Senator Crowley and other ministers for child care deserve credit for the effort that they have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard Liberal government came to power by espousing similar sentiments about the need for affordable, accessible and quality child care in our community. What we found out after their election was that there was no real commitment to those objectives and no real commitment to child care. What we saw in the last budget, the first Howard budget, was a cut of some $500 million out of programs of assistance for child care. There were cuts to capital funding for the 5,500 new places that were planned. The operational subsidy for community based child&hyphen;care centres was abolished. The maximum child&hyphen;care assistance was frozen for two years, but the minimum fees will continue to increase. The child&hyphen;care assistance income test cut&hyphen;offs for families with two or more children were reduced and the additional income disregard for children in the family under the child&hyphen;care assistance income test was abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That whole package of changes introduced by the Howard government effectively took $500 million out of assistance for child care in this country. We have opposed those cuts at every opportunity. I am pleased to say that I think on all those occasions we have been joined by the Democrats and the Greens in arguing the case for quality and affordable child care in the Australian community. We tried to restore capital funding when we considered the appropriation bills, although I think the Democrats got a bit confused on that one.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AX5">Senator CHRIS EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I look forward to your explanation, Senator Woodley. We opposed the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill, which abolished operational subsidies for community based child&hyphen;care centres. We moved to disallow the instrument which gave effect to the government's cuts to child&hyphen;care assistance. We are trying to do that with this instrument: the last component in the government's package of cuts to child care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite successfully moving an urgency motion in this chamber which expressed concern at the government's moves, we have been unable to gain the numbers to prevent these cuts to child care and these reductions in child&hyphen;care assistance. I think that is very disappointing for the Australian community and for the development of a proper child-care system in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This instrument, if allowed, would cap the number of eligible hours for child&hyphen;care assistance for each child at 50 hours. This is a quite difficult concept to come to terms with because it seems, on the face of it, fairly acceptable and because the arguments are fairly technical. Essentially, this measure takes a further $35 million away from child-care assistance to basically low income Australian families. It is the last step in the 1996 budget process of removal of assistance to Australian families. We estimate up to 27,000 hardworking Australian families will be directly affected by this particular cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, on the face of it, this measure seems fairly simple. The government will not be providing child&hyphen;care assistance for more than 50 hours of care. On the face of it, it seems a reasonable proposition that most families would not be needing more than 50 hours of care. But what it does not do is deal with the reality of the structure of child care and of funding and the organisation of child&hyphen;care centres in Australia. Anyone who has had any dealings with them will understand how they are structured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically they are structured by providing a spread of hours available to parents to provide as much flexibility as possible for working families. The spread of hours might be from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. to allow for people who might be required to start work early or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2393"> for people who might have to finish late and not be able to collect their children until much before 6 p.m. While each individual family may not require much more than 50 hours, the centre, in order to meet the needs of families, is open for a larger spread of hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funding arrangements have generally been structured so that people pay on a per day fee. I think my childs centre currently charges $32 per day. It does not matter what time you bring the child in or take the child out of the centre, that is the fee for the day. That gives you the flexibility to drop the child off early, to collect them late or to collect them early if you have the opportunity to get off work earlier. So it provides flexibility and choice for families. That structure is provided by child-care centres to meet the needs of their client group: working families of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure basically provides that child-care centres have to either restructure their hours as a result of these changes, by providing a spread of only 10 hours a day&mdash;which clearly is not a practical solution, because not every family's needs will be the same&mdash;or pass on the costs to parents when they are open beyond 50 hours a week. So they will have to spread the impact of these costs across all the parents who use the centre. The government is not insisting on a strict fee for service solution by this measure. What it is doing is taking $35 million out of child-care funding and passing the costs back to parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own state I have had examples brought to my attention where child-care centres&mdash;largely those in the outer suburbs, where more travelling time is involved for parents&mdash;are being forced to pass on fee increases to parents in the order of $9.60, $10.10 and, in one private centre, $20 per week as a result of the changes that are proposed. Obviously, Madam Acting Deputy President Patterson, as you would be aware, those centres that operate in the outer suburbs usually provide for a greater spread of hours because they are catering for some parents who are commuting to work in the city and back. So they provide a spread of hours that recognises those needs of their client group.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this measure does is artificially impose a 10-hour day on the centres in terms of child&hyphen;care assistance provided. Therefore, it forces them either to restrict their hours, which clearly is not an appropriate response, or to increase their fees, which is the one that they are instituting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to make the point very clearly, too, that in the earlier child-care debates there was a suggestion that the government was attacking the top end of town and taking away welfare from the highly paid. This is clearly not the case with this measure. I would argue it was not the case with the previous measures either. Clearly, in this case, this is increasing costs for people who are in receipt of child-care assistance, people who are assessed as being eligible for child-care assistance because of their relatively lower income levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is a very retrograde step. It is forcing hardship on families because of the increases in costs. Families will either have to cut their child-care hours or, in some cases, leave the work force or reduce their commitment to the work force in order to adjust to the changes that are occurring. I think that is an anti-family measure. It is one that fails to take account of the needs of families in our current age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to note the government's exceptions to the general rule, which provide that the cap will not apply if the family has work related commitments and travelling time of more than 50 hours a week. The range of exceptions that has been made, I think, is a commendable measure. We have been pointing out to the government our concerns about the original measure, and we are glad to see that the government seems to have taken some of these comments on board in providing these exceptions. As I say, that does not alter the net impact of this measure across the sector, which is to add an extra $35 million in costs to Australian families. In my view, this is a budget savings&hyphen;driven measure, not a child-care policy measure of any merit. It fails to take account of the way child care has been structured and the way the needs of Australian families should be met.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2394">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These increases will apply from 1 April if the disallowance motion is not carried. I think we have already seen, from reports in the press and from my own personal discussions with child-care centre staff, that families are responding to the package of measures announced in the last budget. Demand for places seems to have fallen. People are reducing their children's hours. There are reports of people giving up work to avoid increasing child-care costs. The impact is already being felt, and that will only be driven home further if this disallowance motion is not carried today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point that I want to make very strongly is that this measure will make child care even less affordable and accessible for parents. Parents want flexibility. We have to encourage the child-care industry to provide flexibility for parents. This measure reduces the flexibility and capacity of child&hyphen;care centres to meet the demands of parents and families in our community. Therefore, it provides fewer choices, not more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government is very strong on the rhetoric of choice. The government is very strong on arguing that it is trying to give families choice. Again, we see the reality of these changes as reducing choices for families and, in particular, reducing choices for women, because that is where the impact is most felt. Women are often the ones who are sole carers or the ones who, in the end, have to make decisions about career and work opportunities because of the costs and availability of child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have attended a number of meetings in Perth where women have made it very clear that the total impact of these changes is to reduce the choices available to them, reduce their opportunity to work. Therefore, in my view, that reduces the economic capacity of Australia. If we refuse to provide full opportunities for 50 per cent of our population to contribute, then the economic capacity, the overall wealth and wellbeing of the country, is diminished. So I think this is a very retrograde step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to take the opportunity to remind the Senate that we know things are going to get worse for parents who are using 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> child care. The government have cut $500 million from child care in the 1996 budget. We now have leaked documentation that suggests the government are planning to cut a further $400 million in the 1997 budget. These changes are part of an overall attack by the government on child care. I think they are driven by an ideological view of the family and its needs, which is related more to the 1950s than to the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a government that is pro family. This is a government that is pro some families. These changes do not do anything to assist; rather, they work directly against the interests of those families who choose to access quality affordable child care. I urge the Senate to support the disallowance motion and strike one blow for the protection of a quality child-care program for families in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, as Senator Evans said, trumpeted a number of phrases that somehow or other are supposed to encapsulate what it is on about.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Evans said, the coalition has a very narrow understanding of what family is. Those families who are outside of that definition find it very hard to get a look-in.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The support of the Democrats for this disallowance motion is in line with our continuing commitment to families and to child care. It is consistent with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2395"> the position we have taken on this issue since the budget was handed down last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats do believe that two factors, choice and quality, are fundamental to early childhood policy. Choice is about a parent being able to stay at home with a child if they want to, or being able to go out to work, be it full time or part time, if that is what they want to do. That is the real choice. The Democrats recognise the tremendous pressure that many families today are under as they try to juggle their work and family commitments. But, again, this measure is ensuring that working-class people, people at the bottom, those who usually are the ones obliged to travel furthest to work, are the ones who will be penalised by this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recognise that for many families the financial benefits of working only just outweigh the cost of child care and that for some families, an increasing number because of this measure, child care is just no longer an affordable option. This government has reduced, not increased, the choices available to many families by introducing policies which raise the cost of child care. This lack of commitment to families and to child care has increased the hardship which those families suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the months following the budget, I received thousands of letters&mdash;that is not a figure snatched out of the air; it was over 10,000&mdash;from families telling me how any rise in the cost of child care would affect them. Many of these letters were very disturbing. Some, particularly those from single parent families, were nothing short of heart-rending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many single parents said they would be left with no choice but to leave their job or study and go back onto welfare if the cost of child care were to rise. Again, this government takes policy decisions in isolation. They never think that you have to put policies together because something you do in one area will affect what happens in another area. They simply have a grab bag of cuts to all kinds of programs without any thought that those programs are linked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many single parents said that they would be better off on welfare than trying to meet the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cost of having their children cared for while they were working or studying. So again you see that the government really is not cutting its overall budget responsibilities because, by the policy of cutting the hours available to parents for child care, they actually increase the budget in the area of welfare. They really are not achieving anything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does seem that for some parents the fears they have had are now becoming a reality. I recently spoke to one single mother who has had to postpone her undergraduate degree at university just because she can no longer afford to have her child cared for while she is at lectures. She has gone back on welfare. I have got to say to the government: what's the value in that? Surely, the government does not really believe that forcing parents out of the work force or out of their study is an acceptable or desirable choice. As heartless as this government sometimes appears to be, I am sure that is not its intention. But this is the  problem when you have policies which take no account of the effects in other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Stories like this make a mockery of the government's commitment to families. It also makes a mockery of the much heralded family tax initiative. So does the fact that many of the government's other policies have also increased the cost of living for families.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to refer to one or two matters that Senator Evans raised&mdash;I will take his advice on that last point. This measure, which is to put a 50-hour cap on child-care assistance, was announced last year as part of the government's commitment to better targeting child-care outlays and to deliver a more equitable child-care system. That means that families who have to use more than 50 hours of child care a week will not necessarily be deprived of any assistance. There is an exemption&mdash;an exemption which Senator Evans alluded to. I might just outline that to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exemption applies to families who need more than 50 hours care a week to meet their work related commitments. Work related commitments cover paid work, including operating or setting up a business; formal study or training, including on-the-job training; people who are registered and actively looking for work; and travel between the child-care service and the place of work, study or training. That means that, if a family requires more than 50 hours child care for those reasons, they will be exempt from this cap. I can say to the Senate that 86 per cent of families in these situations who receive assistance require less than 50 hours per week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That then leaves some 14 per cent of families who are charged by their child-care service provider for more than 50 hours of care a week. But, on closer analysis, only two per cent of those families actually use more than 50 hours, because of the situation that Senator Evans alluded to: it is not so much the hours you use; it is not charged on a sessional basis, although I would add that a quarter of child-care centres these days do charge on a sessional basis. There is a matter of choice there, which has been mentioned by Senator Woodley, in that families can go to a centre where a sessional charge applies as opposed to a blanket charge.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what you face is that people who are not using that full allocation are charged for 50 hours a week. That is the 12 per cent that I referred to. Fourteen per cent are being charged for more than 50 hours. Yet only two per cent of the 14 per cent are using more than 50 hours of child care. So the problem here relates to the service provider. It is not a problem brought about by government, but it is a problem the government faces, because the government, after all, has to provide assistance. In providing that assistance, it can find itself in a situation where people who are not actually using that excess in child care are receiving the same assistance as those who need in excess of 50 hours. Nonetheless, there is an exemption, which I mentioned, for those families who need it. I might also add that this measure does not impose a daily cap of 10 hours, as I think was suggested. It is a 50&hyphen;hour cap applicable over a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect is that there was a mention of increase in fees. Child&hyphen;care centres impose an increase of fees on a cyclical basis in any event. Ten dollars has been about the average increase in fees in each of the last few years and that is not linked to the 1996 budget of this government. This government has said, `We will provide child&hyphen;care assistance and we will make sure it is equitable. We will make sure that, where families do need more than 50 hours of child care for work related purposes, we will exempt them from this cap and in those circumstances there will be an allowance for those families.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will tend to be those families who are struggling who will need more child-care assistance, because, no doubt, they will have both parents working to make ends meet. Those in that situation can be accommodated by the exemption. So what Senators Woodley and Evans have said about this government being quite heartless is entirely untrue. The government has said, `We will provide assistance, but we will provide it on an equitable basis.' Child&hyphen;care centres should look to charging their fees on a sessional basis, not just on the basis that if you use a couple of hours a day you get charged for a full day's allowance, or the anomaly, which I mentioned earlier, where you get charged for in excess 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2397"> of 50 hours when you in fact do not use 50 hours of child&hyphen;care assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what this is all about. The government has a duty to be efficient in how it assists people. The government has an absolute duty to the taxpayers of the country to see that their money is spent wisely, because, after all, with efficiency in expenditure in these areas, it allows us to govern for all people concerned and to apply income in other areas, particularly in a budgetary context, to meet our obligations in reducing the debt we inherited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures which have been introduced by the government are not draconian. They do allow for those who are battling. The situation is really one where the industry needs to look to itself. I believe that the comments that have been raised by the opposition and the Democrats are unfounded. I believe that these measures are fair. As I pointed out, more than a quarter of these centres are now offering sessional rates. The government sees that as an improvement in the child&hyphen;care industry.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments would prevent RSA providers from charging fees on RSA products. As Senator Sherry has already indicated, the credit unions have already said that they would be quite happy to accept that. The Democrats think it is hard to see why banks or anyone else should need to charge fees on RSAs given that deposits will be infrequent, probably made only quarterly and then by electronic funds transfer. Withdrawals from RSAs will be very rare indeed. As we have already mentioned, these RSAs are likely to be very lucrative for the banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Democrats' section of the 22nd report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, we reminded the government that it had said that RSAs were to be `a simple, low cost, low risk product'. This move would certainly ensure that they were low cost. The credit unions were the ones that actually made that suggestion that there be no fees at all. On that basis, we think these two amendments are very supportable, given that the government intends that they be low cost. If credit unions can offer such a product without charging fees, we see no reason why other financial institutions cannot do likewise.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a commercial decision as to what they do. It is entirely up to them, and we are not attempting to be prescriptive in the way that you are attempting to be. I think that senators, in the context of the debate, are anxious not to unfairly advantage one product compared with another as a result of the rules and regulations which would apply. Senator Allison, we regard what you have put as unwarranted commercial interference. If credit unions do not wish to have fees, that is fine. They do not have to. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We are not saying the same people have to, and that is one of the commercial decisions that they will make. There will, of course, be full disclosure of fees and charges. If credit unions do not wish to charge fees, they will certainly disclose that information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important point&mdash;and I detect that there is at least a view around to this effect&mdash;is that competitive neutrality should be an appropriate principle which we should apply in this area. Existing super funds are not subject to any fee restrictions except, of course, for small amounts. The same rules apply with RSAs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, it is a commercial decision for the credit unions to decide whether they charge fees or not. The structure of the fees should be left to the competitive marketplace. I do not imagine you wish to impose that particular rule on super funds&mdash;I suspect that is the case&mdash;and I underline the fact that there is full disclosure of fees and charges.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the point is that the money which will flow in, in the form of superannuation contributions, is captive&mdash;it is compulsory. We are not just dealing here with a normal bank account. These are contributions that are made on behalf of the employee, so it is reasonable for the government to indeed be prescriptive in this matter. You raise the matter of there being no such requirements for the superannuation funds not to charge fees but, as we all understand, there are much higher returns that flow from superannuation funds. I think we have a responsibility, given that they are low return accounts, that they truly be low cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has the capacity to be prescriptive in this case. As I say, the flow of funds will be, to some degree, guaranteed. Withdrawals will be rare. They should be very easy accounts for the banks to manage. Because they are low return, they should be low cost.

It is important that that issue is dealt with because other small amounts of superannuation of $1,000 or less are protected from erosion of fees and charges in traditional superannuation products. We could not find it in the legislation, but it is apparently going to be in the regulations. We would have been assisted if we had been aware of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out that superannuation is compulsory, at least to SGC levels. The average charge by industry funds and the traditional employer funds is between 80c and $1.20 per week. At the superannuation committee hearings the banks could not provide us with any precise detail of what their fees and charges regime would be. I do not know whether they just could not because they had not thought about it or they would not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You argue that RSAs are to be a level playing field. How is it that an RSA is part of a level playing field when the individual can be signed up to the RSA?

In respect of an in-house employer fund or in respect of an industry fund, currently, at least&mdash;it may change, depending on your government's intentions; we do not know what will happen yet&mdash;the industrial award provides for automatic coverage of a particular industry fund or in-house employer fund. The award provides for that. It may be more than one, but I think in the majority of cases it is only one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, the employer must sign the employee into the prescribed fund. That is a different position from the position we are dealing with with RSAs. RSAs are an individual product that will be delivered to individuals, either collectively or singularly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to you that the bargaining power and knowledge of an employee who is required by an employer to join an RSA is significantly different and that the collective bargaining power of a traditional in-house employer fund and an industry fund is enormous. That is one of the reasons why they can drive down the fees and charges. That is why the fees and charges are very competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we could have emerge with RSAs is similar to the older-type single superannuation products, which were notorious for their high fees and charges, delivered through the traditional agent-type product. We will not have a level playing field in respect of bar

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think a couple of points need to be made. Senator Sherry has pointed out that we are not really in a position of choice and it does not matter how much disclosure there is&mdash;whether it is exit fees, fees generally, operating fees or whatever else. If the employee is not presented with a choice at the outset&mdash;that is, a choice between, say, a credit union which charges no fees at all or a bank, or three banks&mdash;then you could argue whether choice was available. But that is not what the bill provides for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, the employer determines at the outset which RSA the employees' contributions will be made to. Whilst there may be disclosure, there is no choice at that point. At least if we remove the fees, as is commercially viable and possible&mdash;we have already heard that from the credit unions&mdash;then the choice will be more equal and employees will not be, I suppose, disadvantaged because they do not know what the other RSAs might provide in relation to fees and charges. I think that is the point. We are not really talking about choice here. If it was a product that was advertised in the paper and on TV and everybody understood the differences between the providers, and when it came time to have their contributions directed

With superannuation, I pointed out to you that the employee has a 14&hyphen;day option after the account is opened as to whether to stay with the RSA, and full disclosure is required on all those matters which you are rightly concerned about. Equally, there is a 14&hyphen;day rule for public office superannuation funds.

We will no doubt come to that and have a debate about it, but I do not think you can argue that the two products are the same. That is the whole basis behind our position. The opposition's report to the Senate is that they are very different products and one is far less able to provide a good return to the employee than the other, so certain protections need to be put in place in order to make sure that there is not that loss of income for those people who do end up having their contributions sent to the RSAs.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad you acknowledged at the commencement of your answer that the RSA product is different from the more traditional products. RSAs were delivered by banks and other institutions, for profit. That is not a dirty word, but that will be their prime motivation. For profit. That is not the case in respect of the traditional industry&hyphen;type funds&mdash;and, I would argue, most in&hyphen;house employer funds&mdash;because of the trustee relationship. Those funds do not have to make a profit. All the money returns to the members because the trustees hold the superannuation money on behalf of employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of RSAs, banks and other financial institutions will hold the money in order to make a profit. Trustees, because they have a fiduciary duty to the members of the fund, cannot charge what would be regarded 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2405"> as an unreasonable level of fees and charges. There is no sense to it because they do not make a profit. Whereas RSAs, with their delivery by banks and other financial institutions, will presumably have to make a profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the other issues we have canvassed, we do not accept that it is a level playing field. Why should we allow a situation to occur where some people will be charged what we regard as unreasonable fees and charges? The banks cannot tell us what the fees and charges will be, and you did not respond to the earlier point about the ISC overseeing the level of fees and charges that will be made through the RSA product.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think you made a good point when you said that it makes no sense to charge unreasonable fees. It makes no sense at all. If an RSA charges unreasonable fees, it will have no customers. People will not take up RSAs. Why would superannuation funds charge unreasonable fees? They won't. It makes no sense, as Senator Sherry said. Equally, as it makes no sense for superannuation, it makes no sense for RSAs. Of course, if there are complaints about fees&mdash;and I have indicated there is full disclosure&mdash;the ISC will respond to and investigate consumer complaints on fees and charges. I think that provides additional protection, but in a competitive market, as Senator Sherry says, it makes no sense. An institution which acquired a name for charging unreasonable fees, non&hyphen;competitive fees, would not be able to establish a customer base.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Amendments 5 and 6 are very important to this legislation if we are to have the so-called level playing field. The legislation does not prevent banks from doing a deal with an employer to open accounts on behalf of employees. It is fact that an employer can and will open accounts on behalf of employees. We know that banks can do a deal with an employer to ensure that the employer encourages the employees to join their particular RSA product. In fact, the banks admit this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Bankers Association told the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that it is normal commercial practice to engage in deals with employers whereby half a per cent or a full percentage point may be shaved off the margins to provide incentives to the employer. That may not be in the best interests of the employee. Why should an employer enter into a side deal with a bank or other financial institution that delivers employees, at the behest of the employer, into a specific RSA product which, probably in those circumstances,  may not be in the best interests of the employees? This product should be about what is in the best interests of the employee above all else. It is workers' money. It is compulsory.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2407">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that it is not ethical for employers to have any sort of inducement agreement with banks. The point was made earlier that RSAs are a low growth, low return product. Senator Kemp has admitted that. The banks, too, have admitted that in evidence. These are not suitable products in many cases, particularly in the long term, for employers to induce an employee to join. That is our fundamental ethical problem, and that is why we have moved amendments 5 and 6.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine comes from my state of Tasmania, and we are involved in the union movement together. I know he would know the industrial reality at the workplace. I am sure he is aware that, if employers say to employees, after providing all the information, they would like them to join a particular RSA, nine out of 10 employees would sign up. Employers will be doing a lot of encouraging if they are getting a cut&hyphen;price rate on the side from a bank. They will certainly be doing that as enthusiastically as they can. As I have said, we believe such a practice would be totally unethical, and it should be proscribed and not permitted. That is the purpose of our amendments 5 and 6.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to comment on these amendments and draw to the minister's attention how, by not supporting these amendments, the government would be advocating a direct transfer of benefits from employees to employers in terms of the services provided by a superannuation account. I will explain what I mean.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employers who open RSAs may be provided with incentives by the banks to do so. Perhaps the benefit for the employer is a slightly lower interest rate on a commercial loan or perhaps some other financial incentive to use the services of the bank. Whatever it is, there would be potentially some benefit to the employer. Industry funds currently provide a whole range of services to employees who are members of those funds and those services come in the form of associated lower interest home loans for super members' home loans, financial services, or death and disability insurance&mdash;something which comes with most industry funds.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not see a mechanism for RSAs to provide such a benefit to members. In fact, if these amendments do not go through, the only benefit that could possibly arise from an employer taking out an RSA would go not to an employee but straight to the employer. Whilst supporting these amendments would remove the ability for employers to financially be advantaged by some service or perhaps a low interest loan, it will not actually provide the additional service to clients of RSAs that in fact the industry funds provide. Minister, I put to you that unless you support these amendments you are actually supporting the transfer of a subsidiary benefit, if you like, of employees in the case of industry funds to employers, which is potentially the case with RSAs.</PARA></SPEECH>

This can lead to tax avoidance because an RSA is concessionally taxed. Our clause is a tax avoidance clause. That was the reason we put it in: to avoid tax avoidance, because an opportunity may have been opened up for people to pay the interest on an ordinary account into an RSA. That was the purpose of the clause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We oppose these amendments. There are a number of technical problems with what has been proposed. The existing clause prohibits interest offsetting arrangements where one of the accounts involved is an RSA. The policy rationale for that is to prevent interest from an ordinary deposit account, as I said, to be paid into a concessionally taxed RSA, therefore resulting in tax minimisation. This is a tax avoidance clause. It is not the third line 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2408"> forcing issue, which I think is what some were debating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments, we believe, are too broad and unnecessary because they prohibit offsetting arrangements where no concessionally taxed vehicles are involved. In other words, we are conscious of tax avoidance and we have drafted this clause to prevent what we saw as a potential for tax avoidance. My view would be that we will deal with the third line forcing issue when we deal with clause 68, so this issue will remain unresolved until then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, we think the proposed amendments are too broad. This is because the trigger for the prohibition in the amendments is simply that the employer has established an RSA and not that an RSA is involved. There is a distinction there. This would prohibit legitimate interest offsetting arrangements currently permitted under the tax act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also advised that the term `established' has no meaning in the bill. Under the RSA Bill, the employer opens in the name of the employee. Thereafter, the account is controlled by the employee. The notion of an employer establishing an RSA does not fit into this framework because there will be no reference to the employer in the holder of the RSA. This is a tax avoidance measure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, I find it difficult to understand why you are trying to distinguish between this particular amendment and third line forcing given that this amendment effectively deals with the incentive that would arise to encourage employers with respect to third line forcing. It is essential that this issue be dealt with in the context of what is to come with the third line forcing amendment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I have a specific question with respect to interest offset arrangements. Do you envisage that, if RSAs are proceeded with as described, an offset arrangement would be available to the employer or, in fact, the employee&mdash;the person who is in control of the retirement savings account&mdash;in the same way that the Commonwealth's mortgage interest saver account would apply? Do you see that

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator. My advice is that the interest offset is available to the employee. This is not the mechanism, I think, that you feel is essential to third line forcing. This is the tax avoidance clause. The amendments create, in fact, no link between the RSA and the interest offset arrangement. They incorrectly deal with incentive. The proposed amendments deal purely with interest offsetting and are flawed because the RSA is not linked to the interest offsetting.</PARA></TALK.START>

This is certainly not level playing field material&mdash;level playing field material has had a bit of a work over&mdash;or choice.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also put this point to Senator Kemp. Let us assume that an employee in an RSA product leaves one employer and moves to a new employer who has a different RSA product and that new employer encourages them to join their RSA product. The employee ends up in two products. Or assume they move to a new employer who has their own in-house fund and that employer requires them to join that in-house product. The employee cannot get out of their existing RSA product to transfer the money into the new fund. They are in for a year and they are charged whatever the fees and charges are for a year. It just seems to us a ludicrous situation that a time frame of a year is being imposed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a 12-month period. It is up to 12 months. We are not saying that a notice period must be 12 months. We are saying it would be a notice period of up to 12 months and there will be of course, as I have pointed out, RSAs on three-month, six-month and 12-month terms. The longer the term, the higher the rate, presumably. In any case, the balance must be transferred within 12 months of the RSA provider receiving notice. That is the maximum period of time when transferring the balance of an RSA. This, in our view, allows for liquidity risk to be minimised and orderly administrative arrangements for RSA providers to be achieved.</PARA>

So, if you are offering a short-term product&mdash;you may well say a three months product&mdash;the notice period will be very substantially less. We are putting a cap of not more than 12 months. But, if you go into an RSA, you will find that, in the 14-day period, the disclosure will require the RSA to set out the notice period. I think we would expect that the notice period may well be substantially less than the 12&hyphen;month period.

So they are in two funds for that six months. Will they have to pay fees or charges during that six months&mdash;the notice period? We are accepting, for the purpose of the argument, six months notice.

You may well have a one&hyphen;month notice period and there will be some RSAs that will be offering a one&hyphen;month notice period, presumably. That will be attractive to people who are concerned that they want to have the portability aspects of it maximised. I think there may have been a misunderstanding as the debate developed that this gave unlimited rights to RSAs to set long periods. No, no, no. That is not the case at all. RSAs will, in disclosing their fees and charges, be required to disclose the notice period.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was after widespread consultation, presumably for the very good reasons I have stated: for example, that banks may wish to offer longer term products. In other words, they may wish to offer a fixed term of 12 months. There seems to be some logic that they would have a 12&hyphen;month period for a longer term product which offered a longer term rate, and presumably a higher term rate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we want to avoid any misunderstanding that this allows RSAs to wait until 12 months. It will depend on the particular product which is offered. I stress that that will have to be disclosed. Longer term RSAs will presumably have a longer notice period. I do not think that is unreasonable at all. Shorter term RSAs will have a shorter notice period, which is entirely appropriate. This will put a limit on. It is not meant to provide a prescriptive instruction that all RSAs can wait until 12 months to hand the money back; that is not the case at all.

<PARA STYLE="Para">I believe this measure ought to have the unanimous support of the committee. I have circulated this amendment and the other amendment to the Retirement Savings Accounts (Consequential Amendments) Bill. They are modelled after subsection 38(8) of the Life Insurance Act 1945 and the first print of the Life Insurance Bill 1994. The philosophy behind the amendments is that trustee duties and liabilities ought to be imposed on institutions taking the money of those seeking to provide for themselves or their dependants against the vicissitudes of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I explained in my speech during the second reading debate, we are dealing here not with the money of the banks, not even with the money of the superannuation funds and not with the money of the employers but with the money of the workers. It is money that is being set aside for people, including 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2417"> those people who are disabled or in their old age, or for their widows and orphans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For centuries, the law of trusts has been the body of law to which we resort in order to impose obligations where one person entrusts funds to another for the purposes of providing for others. For 50 years, the Life Insurance Act 1945 had that principle enshrined in subsection 38(8). Unfortunately, while that principle was in the first print of the Life Insurance Bill 1994, it somehow later got dropped out without debate as the Life Insurance Bill went through the House of Representatives. I am grateful to the Parliamentary Library for the backgrounder on this. It makes very interesting reading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No explanation was given to the parliament as to why directors of life insurance companies were to be freed from trustee obligations. I gather the suggestion has been made that the particular statutory duties set out in the Life Insurance Act 1945 are superior. Let me remind senators that the first draft of the bill did not have that excised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe the statutory duties would supersede the fiduciary duties, because the law of trusts imposes wider duties than those set out in the Life Insurance Act. In particular, a trustee is answerable to his beneficiaries where he or she makes a profit which could have gone to the beneficiaries but the trustee chooses to take an advantage or profit for himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The law in this area is set out in the leading case of Boardman v. Phipps. Both before and since the leading case of Keech v. Sandford in the 18th century, the courts of equity have always been rightly zealous to ensure that trustees put the interests of beneficiaries first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments I have put forward are based on the former subsection 38(8) of the Life Insurance Act 1945 and the first print of the Life Insurance Bill 1994. They are totally consistent with the policy parliament adhered to for 50 years in relation to life insurance. They are consistent with the trustee obligations imposed on superannuation fund trustees and they are, I believe, the essential starting point for any system of consumer protection. Anyone taking the public's money without a prospectus, as the RSAs will, and promising 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the public that they will invest that money or hold that money for their old age, disability, dependants or death should be subject to the obligations imposed by the law of trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We impose the obligations of the law of trusts in the case of executors and trustees handling deceased estates. We impose the obligation of the law of trusts in the case of private and public sector superannuation funds. It would be inconsistent and unfairly disadvantageous to the community if we were not to require the accountability of trustees in the legislation before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From a technical point of view, I might point out that there is no conceptual problem in marrying the law of trusts and the law of contracts, or debtor and creditor. In Quistclose Investments v. Barclays Bank, the House of Lords found no difficulty in finding trust obligations attached to a loan in a private transaction. Given the legislative precedent of the Life Insurance Act 1945, there is no difficulty in imposing trustee duties and liabilities in the case of both retirement savings accounts and life insurance statutory funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I might also point out that this approach is also followed, and I would like the committee to focus on this, in section 200 of the New South Wales Workers Compensation Act 1987, which imposes almost identical trustee duties and liabilities on the directors of insurance companies undertaking workers compensation business. Clearly, the amendment I am putting forward is consistent with existing policy and is consistent with other proposed amendments to this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By starting with the trustee concept, we will have a clear legislative framework on which to build. Any modifications or additions to trustee obligations can then be specifically set out in the act. But I repeat: given the purposes for which the moneys are invested, the inequality of bargaining power and the trust and confidence which is reposed in these institutions, the law of contracts is not sufficient alone. The duties and liabilities of trustees are the essential foundations that need to be laid for this act to work in the public interest. I commend the amendment to the committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know on this occasion that we share, as we have through most of this legislation so far, Senator Harradine's broad philosophical approach to amendments to this legislation. The amendment that Senator Harradine has moved imposes a fiduciary duty on RSA providers. We will be supporting this amendment for the following reasons, although we have some slight concern about the words `fiduciary duty', but I will come to that at the end.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been reiterated time and time again that superannuation is workers' retirement money&mdash;no&hyphen;one else's. It must be protected at all costs; that is very important. The SGC, the superannuation guarantee charge, is compulsory saving, and it is critical that members of the community are confident that their superannuation money is safe. Labor, when it was in office, with a bipartisan approach to this issue, introduced a new superannuation industry supervision regime, commonly known as SIS, which provided an improved and a higher level of protection for members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was involved in that to some extent, because it was at least partly based on a report that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation undertook particularly in regard to some experiences in the United Kingdom with the Maxwell fraud. The committee&mdash;which I then chaired and of which the deputy chair at the time, Senator Watson, is now chair&mdash;pointed out some of the difficulties in relation to theft and fraud, return on investment and the sole purpose test. Certainly, in part, the new SIS regime that was introduced was based on the concerns identified in that superannuation committee report, as well as on the general change in building the superannuation system. So for these general reasons, we support Senator Harradine's approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do have a concern about the due diligence defence, Senator Harradine. I do not know whether it is possible for you to look at some alternative words in respect of those couple of words on the fifth line of your amendment. I understand the Democrats have some concerns as well. I indicate that, at the end of the day,

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In regard to what has been proposed by Senator Harradine, we should always work on the basis&mdash;and I think it has been pointed out before&mdash;that the money we are dealing with is workers' money. It started off as being workers forgoing a wage increase to actually bring about the introduction of superannuation from a compulsory point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I have a question with regard to the protection measures from the point of view of ensuring that employers actually do pay the money into an RSA. Whilst there appear to be some penalty provisions for breaches of the act, I am not sure how we would go about checking other than under part 10, where you talk about monitoring and investigating RSA providers whereby you make the power available for the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to appoint people to actually do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be interested to see what the government's view is on how the Insurance and Superannuation Commission is situated to do that in the first place, given its funding and given that it has had major problems in conducting its responsibilities even for superannuation funds, let alone for new products such as RSAs, which could be spread across 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2419"> a whole plethora of financial institutions. It is a huge job and I do not think the Insurance and Superannuation Commission would even be capable of doing it; it has not got the funding to do it, for a start.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why Senator Harradine's amendment is so important. What happens if penalties are to apply&mdash;and, if I understood it correctly, the penalty appears to apply to the provider? The provider could be, for instance, the National Australia Bank. In so far as any breach is concerned, it would have the financial wherewithal to string out for a long period any challenge about any wrongdoing on its part. So, if you take the step of making individuals responsible, as is the case with superannuation funds&mdash;in so far as trustees are concerned where they have that fiduciary obligation placed upon them&mdash;then I think it is a step that will ensure greater probity, if we are to end up with RSAs. Quite frankly, I think it is the most stupid thing the government has brought before this parliament to this point in time. The government is trying to introduce this and it talks about choice, et cetera when there is no choice. All you are talking about is giving more money to banks to rip off the poor old punters out there that they are currently ripping off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, we are debating the legislation; I hope it gets defeated ultimately. I will come back to the question of monitoring. I have had experience with regard to employers even paying moneys into a fund. Even though they are obligated by the Industrial Relations Act under award provisions to pay into industry superannuation funds, there is often the case where they do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not quite sure whether I understand this legislation. You say there are obligations for them to present records, et cetera and requirements about whom they should present them to. How are you going to check whether employers, particularly with regard to itinerant workers, are actually paying the money in? It is a problem now, but at least there is a capacity in certain industries for unions representing workers, by checking on an employer in an industry, to seek information from a particular superannuation fund as to whether or not an employer is actually mak 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing contributions on behalf of certain employees. I am not sure that this proposed legislation provides any mechanism for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very thin on the ground with regard to the monitoring and investigating processes. That is why it is important that we at least take another step in the right direction&mdash;if we are to have these stupid things&mdash;by supporting the amendment of Senator Harradine, which would at least put more obligation on the people who will be managing these pathetic savings accounts at the end of the day.</PARA></SPEECH>

Senator Sherry had particular concerns with aspects of the amendment. Although he was happy to support it in principle, he was unhappy with the wording. Senator Allison also raised some issues in relation to it and in relation to due diligence and whether those particular words were needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry drew on the bipartisanship which used to exist, and we used to give him support. The Labor Party brought in the Life Insurance Act 1995. Senator, it was introduced by your government and it inserted new provisions which required directors of life insurance companies to give priority to the interests of policy owners over shareholders. These are akin, as Senator Sherry would know, to fiduciary duties of trustees, but they recognise the non&hyphen;trust based nature of life policies. We thought that you actually got it right in 1995. You brought that provision in, and we supported it. These new provisions, Senator, as you will recall, have made the onerous duties of life insurance directors explicit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, I referred to the Life Insurance Act 1995 because I think you foreshadowed an amendment to that. I addressed the matters there. In relation to this amendment you have moved, the RSAs are deposits held by a bank, building society, credit union or life insurance company. These arrangements are protected by the creditor&hyphen;debtor arrangements of the deposit and contractual nature of life insurance policies. There is no need to provide for the protection of a trust where these structures are in place. RSA providers are non-trust entities, and in place in the non-trust structure is stringent&mdash;I stress that&mdash;prudential supervision in respect of capital adequacy and solvency under the Reserve Bank, AFIC and life insurance regimes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Amendment 9 removes the ability of the employer to lodge an application form for the provision of an RSA on behalf of an employee. This is absolutely fundamental to the Australian Labor Party. We have touched on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this issue previously. Senator Kemp says that employers lodge an application form for employees in current industry and traditional in-house company funds, but RSAs are a different product, a commercial product, offered by banks and other financial institutions. It is a different situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not believe that employers should be signing up employees. There will unfortunately be elements of coercion on some occasions. We believe that it is totally unacceptable for an employer to open an account on behalf of an employee. It is the employee's money. It is to be their retirement income. Why should the employer have that sort of relatively unrestricted ability to sign up employees?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These RSAs are a low growth, low return product. The Consumers Association produced research that showed that an individual remaining in an RSA during the period of their working life can be up to $200,000 worse off, depending on earnings. This situation is not acceptable to the Labor opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of amendment No. 11, we are inserting a new section after clause 51 to set out in the disclosure statement&mdash;that is, to be the provider to the individual when seeking an application to open an RSA. It requires a clear and concise statement. This means that the statement must be in plain English, must be readily understood and must articulate the differences between an RSA and superannuation. That is, an RSA is a low growth, low return product which is not an adequate vehicle for long&hyphen;term retirement savings. It must be made known to the applicant that there are alternative choices available when the opening of an RSA occurs. There are public office superannuation, industry and employer sponsored funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be made clear to the individual that the individual is able to transfer the balance of the RSA to another fund. It must set out the average performance of RSAs as compared to industry, employer and other types of superannuation funds. We have traversed the issue of fees and charges. We believe that these amendments 9 and 11 are absolutely necessary to ensure the security of workers' compulsory retirement savings.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. Their clear, explicit aim, Senator, as you well know, is to attempt to sink RSAs. That is the implicit aim of what you are on about. You are too honest at times, Senator, but we regard this as an amendment which must be defeated. We regard it as an unfair amendment. The key policy objective of RSAs was to assist small business in meeting SG obligations. RSAs aim to be a convenient, low cost, accessible vehicle for small employers. This will not be achieved if the employer cannot open an RSA on behalf of an employee. So we will be opposing your amendment. The RSA bill is based&mdash;and again we get back to the competitive neutrality&mdash;on the existing SI(S) Act 1993. Section 153 of the SI(S) Act currently allows for an employer to open an account in a superannuation fund on behalf of their employees and it is current practice for some public offer superannuation funds. As such, a similar requirement has been included in the RSA bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are after competitive neutrality&mdash;and we are&mdash;I would have thought that you are attempting to impose on RSAs an obligation which you are not prepared to see in relation to superannuation. It is worth noting that in response to a question by Senator Conroy on whether an employee must sign an application form to become a member of a master trust, Mr Steven Child, representing LISA, said an employer opens the account for the employee without the need for the employee to complete a separate application form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also consistent with the superannuation guarantee legislation, which places the obligation on the employer to contribute to a fund on behalf of employees. This minimises costs and maximises convenience for employers,

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments seek to restrict the circumstances in which an employer can open up an RSA on behalf of an employee. Our concern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is that employers will effectively force employees to join RSAs offering lower rates of return than industry funds and that employees might not be in an informed position to transfer their funds in the narrow 14&hyphen;day cooling&hyphen;off period provided by clause 61.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments Nos 11&hyphen;14 will add additional information requirements to be provided to the employees before they apply to join a RSA. Central to this is explaining the advantages and disadvantages of joining an RSA. The amendments do not prevent an employer applying on behalf of an employee, but only when the employee has failed to make a choice of superannuation vehicle within 28 days, which is our amendment No. 12.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It might be useful if I foreshadow what is intended from the other amendments. Amendment No. 15 seeks to partially implement the government's own freedom of choice policy by making it clear that employees should be given the choice at least of joining an industry super fund&mdash;which funds are currently delivering returns twice that of bank term deposits&mdash;an RSA with the financial institution to which their salary is paid or the RSA nominated by the employer. We think this is an essential provision to ensure that employers cannot force employees to join a substandard RSA, bearing in mind that RSAs will not have that trustee structure.</PARA></SPEECH>

In our view, it also imposes an undue administrative burden on an employer, especially on small business. This government is about small business.

Small business will have to get details from casual and itinerant workers who may have moved on. We do not think that is efficient.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another question was whether employers should be required to use a separate application form for each RSA opened on behalf of an employee. The RSA Bill does not restrict an RSA institution from accepting a single application from an employer to open an RSA for more than one employee. Where this occurs, the application must contain enough information to enable the RSA institution to be able to provide relevant disclosure documentation to the employees. I stress that this is consistent with similar provisions in the SI(S) Act which do not restrict an employer from opening a number of accounts  in a superannuation fund with a single application form. That is, any requirement to provide that individual applications be used each time an employer opens an RSA on behalf of an employee would be inconsistent with current practice in the superannuation industry.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 14 is an amendment to change the subsection by inserting the words `who is the potential holder of an RSA'. This is a relatively minor wording amendment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 15 omits section 52(2) and inserts a new subsection that requires the RSA

We believe it is important that the RSA provider be responsible in ensuring that the holder of the RSA is made aware of changed events or circumstances.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The section we seek to omit and substitute removes the responsibility on RSA providers to inform individuals of changing circumstances. If the situation is to remain that employers are able to open RSAs on behalf of employees&mdash;this is something we have been fundamentally opposed to&mdash;then it is doubly imperative that employees are made aware of all changes in events and circumstances relating to the provision of RSAs. Even if it is solely the individual's choice as to the opening of an RSA, it is still imperative that the RSA provider inform them of any change in circumstances which may alter the offering of the product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Amendment 16 omits section 52(3) and substitutes a new subsection which sets out the grounds on which it is reasonable for an RSA provider to be assured of the individual's consent to the opening of the RSA. There are reasons for this approach. Firstly, the Australian Banking Association raised a number of important points in its submission to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation regarding the deficiency in the bills in defining what would constitute reasonable grounds for the RSA provider to assume there had been consent and knowledge surrounding the opening of the RSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition proposes that the reasonable grounds include the provision of an application form, which would contain statements outlining the nature of the product, and the signing of the application by the individual. This would ensure that the RSA provider could be satisfied that the individual did understand their decision to open an RSA and would ensure the RSA provider a defence to any allegation that they had recklessly or intentionally allowed an individual to open an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2430"> RSA without full knowledge of the product. We believe this amendment, in concert with previous amendments to eligible applications, provides a strong disclosure regime that will ensure that individual consumers receive adequate information for what is a new type of product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendment 17 is a rewriting of this section for the purposes of completeness. In not moving to delete section 52(4), we reserve the right to examine the regulations and, where it will be necessary, to seek disallowance to those regulations. I am noting this in passing in respect of our amendment 17. It is important to note that by not deleting section 52(4) we are not necessarily accepting regulations that would give force to this subsection. We have not seen the regulations yet. We do not know the detail of what would be contained in them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">We seek to delete section 53 which provides for information that is to be given to employers who open accounts on behalf of employees. Our reasons for doing this are that we do not support the ability of employers to open accounts on behalf of employees. We have been very consistent about this throughout this debate. It is our belief that, under section 153 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, employers have to seek consent from employees in order to open a fund account on their behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Superannuation funds provide a range of services and benefits and a good investment return to members. Those institutions that are seeking to provide RSAs are not currently 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proposing to make available insurance cover, for example; access to cheap home loans&mdash;that would certainly be against the banks' interests; or other services that are offered by some funds. It is concerning to the opposition that the possibility exists under the present bills for employers to enter into a commercial relationship which may be of benefit between the employer and the RSA provider, provided the employer opens RSAs for employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would argue the reality of the industrial situation is such that if employees are presented with the option of either accepting an RSA or no superannuation and no job the employee will obviously take the RSA option. The government has said that these products are to be for low income earners, casual part-timers and itinerant workers. It is these workers who are in the least powerful industrial position to negotiate where their superannuation contributions are to be placed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is these same workers who are the very workers who need to save for their retirement through superannuation as their superannuation guarantee contributions will be relatively modest and it is one of the few ways which will ensure some stability and security in their retirement. It is therefore critical that superannuation they are able to save is in a fund that performs consistently and provides retirement benefits. But RSAs will not achieve this end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst RSAs will undoubtedly be consistent, they will be consistently performing at a rate varying somewhere between one&hyphen;half, one or two per cent below that of other funds. This will fail to produce maximum retirement benefits. I have already illustrated that the Australian Consumers Association gave some figures to our hearings about the lower interest and the resulting outcome can leave people significantly worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is difficult to see how the employer would be in a position to really consider what would be the best retirement option for an employee's superannuation savings. Why should the employer be involved in such a direct way in effectively choosing the retirement options for their employee? That is the consequence of the approach of the government. The employer is inevitably going to be more concerned about the commercial per 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2433"> formance of their business, as they should be. They are more likely to require an employee to join a particular RSA&mdash;and this would not be all employers, but there would certainly be some&mdash;in order to gain some commercial advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You only have to ask the banks. Clearly, ANZ, National Australia, Commonwealth, et cetera, will target their business customers and they are most likely to sell products through that link with their employer who is a business customer of theirs at that point in time. They will use that commercial connection to gain the advantage in respect of that employer's employees. I do not think it will be coincidence that we will have banks&mdash;</PARA>

We will have a situation where the ANZ, for example, has a commercial relationship with an employer and co-incidentally&mdash;surprise, surprise!&mdash;all the employees who work for that employer are in the ANZ's RSAs. I am sure there will be a correlation. It will be interesting to have a look at this as it evolves over time. But there will certainly be a connection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should the employer use what is a different set of relationships, commercial relationships? It is their business that rises or falls on their own performance, but why should that affect an employee's retirement income?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is probably the fifth or sixth time Senator Sherry has come at this in an attempt to sustain the Labor Party position and in an attempt to defeat the fundamental underlying principles of the coalition policy which we received endorsement for at the election.

Your fundamental position was wrong, according to my advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Removing the employer ability to open accounts is also at odds with the SG regime. What you are doing, as you have tried to do all evening, is trying to distort the playing field, weighing it heavily in favour of the superannuation funds in order to achieve your goal to impose undue administrative burdens on employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 53 is based on section 158 of the SI(S) Act. It provides employers with information on which to make a decision whether an RSA meets the needs of their employees. Section 158 of the SI(S) Act requires a public office superannuation fund to provide information to the employer before they become a standard employer sponsor of the fund&mdash;that is, open an account on behalf of their employees. This  allows the employer to make a decision about the fund and whether it meets the needs of the employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party is trying to remove the equivalent requirement from the RSA bill. Employers will not have the opportunity to make this decision, thereby opening an RSA or even providing the choice of an RSA, which the employer may not have made if they were provided with information before opening the account.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been consistent in our approach on this issue, as Senator Kemp has acknowledged. We do not find it acceptable that employers can open an RSA on behalf of an employee. As a consequence, it is certainly our intention to remove the ability of the employer to open an RSA on behalf of an employee. There is no requirement for employers to provide documentation to employees. It is the view of the opposition that it should be the sole decision of the individual to open an RSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will paraphrase because I am aware of the time, so I will not go through all our arguments. As I have previously stated, we believe that currently employers have to gain an employee's consent to open a superannuation fund account on behalf of the employee. For all the reasons we have already outlined, we believe that superannuation funds are a far better vehicle through which to save for retirement. We are concerned that should the employer retain the ability to open an RSA on behalf of an employee&mdash;this remains in the bill&mdash;a number of situations will arise when employees are forced into low growth, low return products in order for the employer to reap a commercial advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the late 1980s and early 1990s the Industrial Relations Commission arbitrated a number of disputes in relation to employers choosing superannuation funds that were not the preferred choice of the employees. The opposition believes that it is critical to ensure that a similar legal mess does not arise under the RSA regime. We believe that the industrial relations coverage in respect of superannuation has worked well. Currently, awards provide either for a choice of fund or, specifically, a particular fund into which superannuation contributions must be paid.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment will remove the ability of an employer to make contributions to the RSA of an employee after opening the RSA on behalf of the employee. We have stated that we do not support the government's position of allowing employers to open accounts on behalf of employees. We believe that this policy position does not meet the government's position to provide greater choice in the superannuation product market for employees and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's RSA bills provide choice for the employer. We think this is a ridiculous approach. It is the employee choice&mdash;that is the person who should make the choice. In supporting this concept of choice, we believe the choice has to be informed, free and effective. We hear this continual rhetoric from the government about choice, but what about informed choice, free choice and effective choice? They are the imperatives that underline real choice. This is about real choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not believe the government is interested in providing real choice to employ 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ees. If the government were serious about providing choice, this would be a product designed for employees rather than a product designed for employers. Why is the product so fundamentally designed around employers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under section 62, the government would allow an employer to open an account on behalf of an employee and then automatically begin contributing into that account. As I have said, certainly in this case we find this a ridiculous situation. The situation could and would undoubtedly arise&mdash;should an employer remain capable of opening an account on behalf of an employee&mdash;of that employee not even knowing that they have an RSA. That seems to be ridiculous. They are receiving contributions into it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This could leave the employee in an untenable position. It would be a very brave employee who goes to their employer after the employer has paid the money in without the employee's permission and says, `Sorry, I do not want the RSA. Please redirect my contributions elsewhere.' I suggest that commonsense would dictate that most employers would simply say, `It is there. You may as well leave it there.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation could arise where a casual worker may be put into several different RSAs as a result of having different employers. It is not uncommon for a casual employee to have two or three different jobs at the same&mdash;a hotel, a restaurant and a retail job in the same week&mdash;and the employer, without the employee's permission, could put money into three different RSA products. That is something that will occur quite frequently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is defeating its own rationale with this approach. Supposedly this is about simplification. If the employee is in an ANZ RSA account, how do they on the government's approach end up in three different RSAs? Because the employer is putting money in before the employee gives authority. It is going to lead to an extremely messy situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kemp, rather than enhancing a cohesion, I submit that when we look back on this legislation in three or five years time, if we are in this place&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope to be here, yes. But when we look back and reflect, my prediction is that RSAs will lead to a multiplicity of accounts for the sort of reason I have just outlined. Because of the changing nature of the work force, it is very common for an employee to have two or three jobs at the one time and it is happening with increasing frequency. This is going to lead to an absurd position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most employees are not informed about and are not particularly well educated about these superannuation choices that the government is giving them. When they find they are in three RSAs accounts and the employer has already been paying the money in, what do they do? I would submit that it is going to be very messy. It will exacerbate the already difficult situation we have with multiple accounts. The government by this approach is adding to this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who will be worst affected will be casual and part-time employees. These are the low income employees who can ill afford to be in two or three different RSAs accounts unknowingly because the employer has put them there. They tend to be in the service sector. I know Senator Harradine has had extensive experience in the service sector, like myself. They were different sectors, but Senator Harradine is aware of the practical problems that exist at the workplace level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not uncommon for people to have more than one job. When I go back to my old workplace at Wrest Point&mdash;where I started and where work is pretty regular&mdash;and talk to the people there, the majority of casual employees often comment to me, `I am working at the Doctor Syntax Hotel, the Downtowner and at Wrest Point as well.' They could well end up in different RSA products without them knowing because the employer has put them in a product because he has struck a deal with his bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know we have made some of these points on previous occasions in this debate, but with some aspects of this legislation, at least, there is going to be some very messy situations that will hurt hardest the casual, the lower paid, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the part-time, the itinerant workers who have not got a lot of money going into super. Often these people are in the position of least bargaining power and are the least well educated about how to make an effective choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I urge the Senate to strongly consider Labor's position in respect of how money is to be held. I just cannot conceive why employers should be putting money into people's accounts without their knowledge&mdash;and probably into more than one account&mdash;in respect of the sort of work the government says this legislation is designed for.</PARA></SPEECH>

We will obviously have to address that when the bill comes back. My advice is that the effect of deleting clauses 53 and 54 is that the RSA provider will not be required to give any information before it opens an account on behalf of an employee. A very perverse result has resulted from the way this bill has been conducted; I dare say it will have to come back to this chamber to get that fixed up. I just flag that with you.

We have not been able to convince the Senate of that argument, but surely workers are entitled to a little more than 14 days to discover they are in accounts that they did not know they were in, and to be able to take some effective action.

Suppose they are in an RSA product at the beginning of the month because they are with employer X. They have got one or two other casual jobs and they come back to employer X at the end of the month.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, I will paraphrase in the interests of time. Firstly, in respect of our amendment 22, we propose to insert the word `improper' into section 68 of part 7 of the bill. This will have the effect of ensuring that civil liability may arise in situations where the RSA provider has behaved in an improper manner. The impropriety that this amendment intends to catch is contained in our amendment 25, which seeks to insert a new clause in the bill that prohibits third line forcing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor is concerned that the situation may arise where the RSA provider may offer a range of inducements to encourage employers to open RSAs on behalf of employees. We had some debate on this earlier. We did carry earlier, and I do thank the Senate for supporting it, a provision that said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2440">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">An RSA provider must not enter into any interest offset arrangements or combination of counter arrangements with any employer who, or constitutional corporation which, has established an RSA.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This approach in respect of these amendments is entirely consistent with what was carried earlier and, as Senator Kemp pointed out, he did not want it carried earlier but it was carried. He thought this was the appropriate place and I hope that you, Senator Kemp, will at least consistently approach the position and accept that a proposition of this type should be put in. So this is the effect of opposition amendments 22 to 25. As I said earlier, the Bankers Association told the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that inducements were a normal practice for financial institutions. We have made the point time and time again that these accounts are for the benefit of the employee, not the employer, who may be induced by some relationship with their particular financial institution. We have been over this extensively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to amendment 23, we extend the objects of the part to ensure that civil liability extends to section 76A. As I have already explained, we believe it would be improper for an employer to open an account on behalf of an employee. The employee must have the liability to action a civil liability claim if that person believes the employer has engaged in improper conduct. I have referred to what might occur with an improper relationship with the financial institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 24 seeks to extend clause 73 so that an individual can bring a civil liability action under clause 73 where our proposed section 76 has been contravened. Our amendment 25 is a new clause which defines what would constitute improper conduct on behalf of an RSA provider and it ensures that a contravention of the section may give rise to civil liability action. Again, paraphrasing because of time, this section defines improper conduct to include the provision of goods or services and the offer to supply goods or services or the allowing of a discount, allowance, rebate or credit in relation to the supply, or proposed supply, of goods or services to a person or corporation where a condition is that one or more of the employees becomes a holder of an RSA.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We contend that this sort of behaviour by the employer&mdash;entering into some sort of financial relationship with the financial institution&mdash;is fundamentally improper and unfair to the interests of the employee. We believe it is unethical for an employer to be involved in such conduct and that, under this legislation, it should be very clearly outlawed. I hope that Senator Kemp is not going to say, `Look, this is tilting the level playing field the other way.' Other forms of superannuation saving have a trustee governing them. They cannot enter into improper relationships because it is the duty of the trustee to act in the best interests of the members of the fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With RSAs, it is a different type of product. It is the duty of the bank to make a profit. As many members as can be are signed up to RSAs through employers and, in most instances, it is arguably the duty of employers to make a profit. They can form a financial relationship to their advantage with their financial institution, which does not advantage the employee, and above all else&mdash;as Senator Harradine and other speakers in this debate have alluded to&mdash;it is the interests of the employee that must be protected from improper behaviour, which is ethically unsound and insupportable. That is the effect of opposition amendments 22 to 25.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to indicate that the Democrats will support the opposition's amendments. They are, in fact, identical to Democrats amendments 19 to 21 and 24. What they seek to do is to fix a hole in section 47 of the Trade Practices Act which was very clearly identified by the Australian Consumers Association during the inquiry&mdash;indeed, they called it third line forcing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is quite clear is that the act will not prevent banks from offering employers an incentive to herd their employees into RSAs even if those RSAs are not in the employees' interests. This provision, which was drafted by the ACA lawyers, will outlaw such conduct and make it very clear that this is what is intended. The Democrats strongly support these amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2441"> couple of points to follow up those made by Senator Sherry. I would like to put them in the context of the comparison between what RSAs have to offer to potential members, or potential clients, and what the industry super schemes have to offer. When the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) talks about choice, it is entirely appropriate to compare the types of benefits that are being offered by the two different approaches.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that what is offered to members of industry super funds is far more than the actual contribution that is being made by the employer. By virtue of the fact that trustees are required to act in the best interests of the members, a whole range of benefits have been developed around the industry super schemes. Some of those benefits include: the provision of financial services; the provision of death and disability cover insurance; and the provision of access, by virtue of membership, to other financial services, including home loan services. All of these services do not cost the members of the industry super schemes one cent more. They come as part of the package of being a member of that scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Comparatively, what RSAs have to offer is quite inferior. Unless these amendments are supported, we could actually have the situation where the only group that benefits from any subsidiary benefit, as a result of these contributions being made into an account on behalf of an employee, will be the employers because it will go directly to the employers, and it will go to employers in the form of incentives. Perhaps the incentive will be a slightly lower rate for a commercial loan. Perhaps it will be some sort of deal based on accounts. Perhaps it will go back to the issue that we discussed earlier with respect to offset interest rate accounts. Perhaps the banks will say, `If you open 12 RSA accounts with us, you get this bonus.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know how they will package it, but, unless these amendments are supported here this evening, we are in the very real danger of voting to allow a direct transfer of subsidiary benefits for employees to go from the employee to the employer. I believe what 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is being proposed here this evening represents a very serious breach of equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not need to refer too often to Senator Kemp's rhetoric about choice. This issue points out, almost more clearly than any other that we have discussed in the committee stage, that we are dealing with an inferior product that cannot provide an adequate benefit. Certainly, if these amendments are not passed, there will be a specific inferior benefit and a transfer of benefit from the employees to the employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine has consistently made the point throughout the committee stage of this debate that this is workers' money. The employers will be directly benefiting by virtue of the fact that they have arranged for workers' money to go into a specific account. If that is not unfair, then I do not know what Senator Kemp will attempt to define as fair and not fair. I do not believe that this bill has too much in it that is fair. But, unless the government supports these amendments, it will blatantly be unfair in favour of the employer against the employee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments are too broad because we believe they prevent an individual who is an RSA holder from obtaining discounts on ordinary banking products. I do not know whether that is the intention, but that is the advice I have. This arises because references to `person' cover more than just employers. Of course, industry funds can offer deals and benefits to their members, but a bank customer holding an RSA will not be eligible for any commercial incentives offered by the bank. That is what you are seeking. It is inconsistent with the view that you hold on industry 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2442"> funds. It represents yet another attempt to try to advantage other types of products at the expense of RSAs.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You said yes, so to me that indicates that what we were talking about then in that context and again here is that employers can benefit from having RSA accounts at a particular bank. So please do not cast aspersions as to the point of view that I am expressing. This deals specifically with incentives offered to employers, not employees. I do not believe you are correct in your interpretation that my view is inconsistent, because at this stage there is certainly an opportunity for employers to gain some benefit unless this amendment is passed.</PARA></SPEECH>

I think the minister admitted that undue pressure could be applied and that circumstances could arise where the benefits of the investment of workers' funds in RSAs could go to the employers rather than to those to whom it was designed to go. This matter was raised in Senate committee hearings. I do not see why the government cannot agree with this on the basis of freedom of choice.

<PARA STYLE="Para">We are seeking to delete the due diligence defence from section 168. We had a discussion about due diligence earlier in the evening. I do not want to keep us too late this evening, but due diligence requires a provider to provide to a court that they took all reasonable steps. This step may include a reasonable mistake, reasonable reliance on information provided by another person, that the act or default was due to the action of another, or they took all reasonable steps to avoid the contravention. Given the compulsory nature of superannuation and the fact that it is specifically required to be saved to provide for an individual's retirement, it is unacceptable to Labor that a provider may avoid liability by providing that they took reasonable steps.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of constructive amendments to deal with what we believe were serious deficiencies in the government's approach in respect of retirement savings legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give a few examples of our amendments that were defeated during the committee stage. We moved a very important amendment with Democrat support&mdash;we appreciate this&mdash;and with the support of Senator Harradine and the Greens in respect of a division, that fees and charges could not reduce the balance of accounts and, indeed, could not be charged by the financial institutions which seek to offer RSAs. A further amendment, which we thought was eminently reasonable and relatively small in the context of the issues being considered, was to ensure that a bank or other financial institution would not hold the moneys for up to 12 months. We sought to substitute 28 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time and time again, Labor has attempted to ensure that it is not the employer that offers the RSA. It is the fundamental choice of the employee. The last division we had concerned third line forcing. Earlier in the evening we were able to have passed one important amendment which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An RSA provider must not enter into any interest off&hyphen;set arrangements or combination account arrangements with any employer who, or constitutional corporation which, has established an RSA.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet, unfortunately, when we came to further amendments on the problem of third line forcing the government did not accept, and indeed voted against, what we believe were eminently reasonable amendments to protect employees. The central issue of debate here is that this is employees' money and it is not reasonable for employers to impose&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. It is not reasonable to allow an employer to control the destiny of an employee's in many cases life savings, which are definitely for retirement purposes and are compulsory savings. We have taken a positive approach. We accept in principle that the government had RSAs within its election manifesto, although it did not accept one of the important amendments we moved that was contained in its 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2446"> election manifesto and that would have allowed a complying superannuation fund to offer RSAs. So even they have contradicted the position they took to the election. But the critical issue is one of balance, protection and of informed choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time and time again we have warned the government with what we believe were quite reasonable amendments. We have warned the government consistently that if it wants the RSA legislation then it needs to consider and accept, and hopefully support, reasonable amendments. They would not even support the extension of the cooling off period from 14 days to 28 days. It is the height of hypocrisy for the government to claim that it is concerned about choice and about protecting employees' interests when time and time again it has rejected reasonable amendments that protect employees from this important, major and very substantial change to superannuation arrangements in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the government's approach is reflected in a broader approach to superannuation generally which is highly destructive. As a consequence of the very negative approach the government has taken to our amendments, Labor is left with no choice but to oppose the third reading of this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with some regret that I announce that the Democrats will be voting against the third reading of these bills. We did support the notion of RSAs. We believe there is a role for them in the superannuation system, but we do think it is a very limited role because RSAs have their limitations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On current terms, they will provide a return of about five to six per cent a year, whilst the industry's superannuation funds are returning 13 per cent. There is nothing level about that. There is no level playing field when you compare those two schemes. Yet these bills will allow employers to herd their employees into these substandard accounts, without proper information and without offering them proper freedom of choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills fall very well short of the government's election commitment to provide freedom of choice and, I must say, totally ignore all of the evidence brought to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senate inquiry. The Democrats moved a range of amendments throughout this debate, as did the opposition, and we believe they would have made RSAs fairer, more accountable and entered into as a result of a genuine, informed choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The combination of the government and Senator Colston has in effect defeated all of those amendments. I have to say that it is particularly disappointing to me and to my office because we were led to believe that Senator Colston's office was sympathetic to these issues. The consumers association and the ACTU were given a similar response. They will be disappointed tonight that ordinary workers and superannuation consumers will be left exposed by these very flawed bills. As a result, we are left with bills which are unfair and flawed, as I say, and which, I think, will be used to exploit workers with low levels of financial knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to see that happen. I would prefer to see no RSAs rather than RSAs on the outrageous terms that have been left in this bill. I wish to make it clear, in announcing that we will oppose the bill as it stands, that we are prepared to support RSA legislation with amendments and I am prepared to sit down with Senator Kemp at any time and to talk about what these amendments might be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kemp has had the Democrats' amendments for more than a week. They are, as I have said already, in direct response to the evidence submitted to the Senate committee. They attempt to ensure that the coalition's policy commitment that RSAs would increase choice would in fact come to pass. Yet not once has the minister acknowledged the concerns that that wide range of people brought to the super committee. As usual, the Senate committee received submissions and had witnesses appear before it from right across the industry and from a very wide range of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is my hope that this legislation is defeated tonight and that the government reviews its position, that it talks with us, to the opposition and to Senator Harradine and develops a bill that is far more balanced, far 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2447"> fairer and not much like the one we have before us.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that we have been able, throughout the committee stage, to demonstrate that RSAs are not an equitable superannuation product. They in fact promote greater inequity in workers' superannuation. RSAs are obviously targeted to smaller amounts and have been described as a low risk, low return product. Therefore, they specifically target casual, part&hyphen;time and itinerant workers, of whom migrants and women make up a significant proportion. So, once again, this government's actions disproportionately disadvantage these people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has relied upon the rhetoric of choice to disguise the reduction in the benefits that will be available to recipients of super guarantee contributions through RSAs. This can easily be exposed as a veil of deception on two counts. First of all, there is the issue of employers being able to open accounts. It assumes that there is an equitable power relationship between employees and employers. We on this side of the chamber know that that is certainly not the case, and to assume as much is not representative and also shows that this government has a case of relevance deprivation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that we have an inferior product which plays on expediency of process and does not rely on merit. RSAs do not represent good value for money for the worker's dollar. This rhetoric was apparent also with respect to workplace relations, where the government opposed super as an allowable matter under severely diminished awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to look no further than Senator Kemp's shallow justification for sections of this bill to understand what the government's agenda is. The banks want access to the super market. They have long lobbied for this and are now seeing&mdash;or thought they were seeing&mdash;the fruits of their efforts. The banks have long resented the success of the industry super funds, and their clamouring has grown with the growth of the financial services of the industry super funds. This explains the specific exclusion of complying funds from 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> providing RSAs, as we saw through the committee process. This bill is, or was to be, the payback by the government to the banks and it progresses the government agenda to undermine the union backed industry funds.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Margetts has indicated, from the outset the Greens were very concerned about this legislation as it stood. It is particularly concerning because it gives employers the ability to transfer employees' funds into low interest accounts, which is going to advantage the banks&mdash;many of which are, of course, not owned within the country&mdash;at really no advantage to those employees. We have supported serial amendments which would have made the legislation better and which would have led to some improvement in the situation in so far as this legislation has impact upon those employees. But the amendments have, with an exception here or there, failed to get through. In that situation we are back at base one, where we do not support the legislation as it stands.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose I am in a cleft stick here in the sense that if I vote for the third reading, the bill will go back to the House of Representatives. If the House of Representatives disagrees with the amendments that we have made, the matter will come back before this chamber and a motion could be moved by the government that the Senate does not insist on the amendments that it has made. What will be the result if that motion is agreed to? It will mean that the amendments that were in fact made will not be in the legislation and the clauses that were removed will be part of the bill. So in fact we will then have a very strange piece of legislation indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose in that sense the only alternative I have got is to vote against the third reading and hope that the government takes notice of what has been said in this debate by Senator Sherry and by others, including Senator Allison, in respect of attempting to get RSAs that are fair and that recognise that this is workers' money that we are talking about which should be held in trust, and that the directors of the RSAs and the RSAs themselves should have all the liability that is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2448"> imposed by many decades of cases of trust law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very surprised that the government even refused to vote for my amendment, which was to ensure that it is workers' money that is going into RSAs. The RSAs themselves and the directors of RSAs should realise that and that the money is to be there for the workers in their retirement or, in the case of their death, for their widows and orphans. As such, it is absolutely necessary that they act as trustees and that they accept the fiduciary duties of trustees. But, no, the government refused to accept that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it so happened, thanks to what you did, Mr Deputy President, that provision did in fact pass this chamber. The trouble is, of course, that it goes back to the House of Representatives. If the House of Representatives disagrees with it, it comes back here. The negative motion means that that is down the drain and all of the other clauses where there was a negative vote will also be lost. That is the practical situation. Even if it were not the practical situation, I believe I have a duty to support this. I have regard to what Senator Sherry said in opening the debate on the third reading. He made some extremely good points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were a number of amendments that I thought the government would have agreed to. But there seems to have been no willingness on the part of the government to agree, as Senator Sherry said, to even the 28 days as compared with the 14 days given to a worker to respond. Obviously, there has to be a bit more work done by the government if it intends to honour its election commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind the chamber, as in fact Senator Sherry reminded the chamber, that the promise was that superannuation funds would be able to establish RSAs. That is as I understand the commitment that the government gave. But there is nothing in here, and all attempts by Senator Sherry to have that included have gone by the board, because the government has voted against it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I advise the Senate that I will be voting against the third reading, in the hope, as has been indicated by Senator Allison, that the government will sit down and have a good 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> look at this to see whether we can do something to salvage the situation and bring in new legislation which will meet the tests of fairness, honesty and disclosure and recognise that RSAs are in fact the equivalent of trusts and the directors should have the obligations thereof.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We now are voting on the third reading and it will be an interesting test for the Senate. This bill was to put into effect a clear election policy of the government&mdash;a policy that the government went to the election on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Senate fails to pass that, it will be attempting to force the government to break a clear election commitment. Of course, if the third reading failed, the onus would be on the Senate and the obstruction which has been shown in the course of today, some five hours, by Senator Harradine and others. Senator Harradine knows that we sought discussions on the RSAs. The reality is that those were fairly cursory, I think due to time constraints on your part. There was no lack of effort to carry out consultations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill of course has passed all stages except the third reading stage. The Senate has expressed its view on all stages of the bill. We saw today an attempt by particularly the opposition and others to prevent, in a range of amendments, the government from being able to offer RSAs in a competitively neutral fashion with superannuation products. The Labor Party has never accepted that. The Labor Party has never accepted the policy of RSAs. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will show how appropriate, in expressing the Labor Party policies, were the comments of Senator Murphy in his very brief remarks in the course of this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the third reading stage does not fail. The government has answered all the questions which were put forward. The vast range of amendments that were being posed were, essentially&mdash;if you could sum them up in one word&mdash;to make RSAs uncompetitive. The test that was used, time and time again, was the regulatory framework that has been put in relation to RSAs similar to other superannuation products. The answer, time and time 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2449"> again, was yes. Time and time again, we had Senator Sherry lead the attack in attempting to blatantly undermine the substance of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope other parties will reconsider. If I remember correctly, the Democrats went to an election to `keep the bastards honest'. I thought that was their approach. Nothing could be more honest, Senator Allison, than keeping your election commitments. No&hyphen;one has argued that this is not a clear election commitment. In all this, Labor has been determined to protect what it sees as a particular special interest group&mdash;particularly industry funds. For all the weasel words you uttered, Senator Sherry, why should we ignore the fact that what you did time and time again with your amendments was ensure&mdash;which you openly admitted&mdash;that RSAs would not be competitive with other superannuation products. That was your clear intention through all your amendments&mdash;and openly admitted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regard it as a pity, to be quite frank, that the Democrats have chosen to cooperate with the Labor Party in this particular action. I regard it as a pity because I would have thought that the Democrats would have been able to mark out a singular position. The fact is they should have recognised there was an election commitment. The Democrats should also have recognised that this has been extensively debated through the chamber and that the issues which they raised had been discussed. Talk about raising issues which are hardly of mighty substance&mdash;whether it should be 14 or 28 or 30 days! The reality is that we were putting in place exactly the same arrangements which you put in place under the SI(S) Act. That is exactly what we were putting in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To pretend that this is some awful arrangement that we have proposed is frankly absurd. If this fails, the opposition's action tonight should be seen for what it is: a deliberate and blatant attempt to obstruct a clear election promise. I regret that the Democrats have apparently chosen to assist the Labor Party in this particular action. I think that is a pity. I think it is correct to say that the Greens did 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not take any part in this particular debate&mdash;I do not blame them for that. They made no particular contribution to the debate but, nonetheless, they have chosen to assist the Labor Party in attempting to prevent the government putting its election promise into effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we put before this chamber was perfectly reasonable: it was to design a regulatory framework for RSAs which, as far as practicable, was similar to the SIS act where relevant. Even that could not be accepted. What we are hearing here in the pious words of Senator Sherry is nothing more than a blatant effort to prevent the government putting its election promise into effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Sherry interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is. It is blatant, and it should be seen for exactly what it is, Senator Sherry. I believe it is protecting a particular constituency and its union mates. Frankly, that other groupings in the Senate give any comfort to this is a great pity. Senator Harradine, I accept your attitude on this. I think it is pity that it has turned out this way. I am not sure what can be done, but I am sorry that comfort has been given to the Labor Party. The Labor Party could not win this debate in the election and could not win it up to this stage in the Senate. But, through a particular action proposed by Senator Sherry, it will seek to defeat, I believe, a perfectly reasonable and appropriate bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the third reading should fail, I believe it will be seen as a blatant piece of Senate obstruction; a particularly serious one because of the nature of the bill and because it would give effect to an election promise.

The $70 000 and $85 000 thresholds will be indexed from 1997-98 to the increase in full time adult average weekly ordinary times earnings (AWOTE).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am tempted to talk about superannuation. We were talking about it for five hours and I anticipate that we will be talking about it for at least double that time. I am mindful of the program. We have taken a positive approach this evening and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2454"> have sought to move a range of amendments, but that is another story.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1996&hyphen;97 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1996&hyphen;97 cover supplementary estimates. There are a number of issues I wish to mention. It is traditional to cover a range of issues when dealing with estimates. I would like to remind the Senate that the supplementary estimates and the process we have just been through with respect to the estimates gave us an opportunity to highlight the government's mid&hyphen;year economic review. This mid&hyphen;year economic review contained some 173 errors.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="RAY" NAMEID="UI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How many?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It contained 173 errors. In fact, Senator Kemp did not know about them until I rose in question time and got the highlighter pen out and attempted to draw it to the chamber's attention and ask for an explanation as to why there were 173 errors in that mid&hyphen;year economic review. This was the document heralded by the government&mdash;the great document that we were going to see every year&mdash;to report on budget and general economic progress. Yet it contained 173 errors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a little surprised when I went to estimates and attempted to find out why all these errors occurred. The initial response of Treasury was to blame Finance. We did go off to talk to Finance a little later. By this time they had been tipped off by Treasury. They did not attempt to buck&hyphen;pass, but they did highlight the role of Treasury in putting together the document that contained all those dreadful errors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it does highlight another issue with the approach to estimates generally. Again, this was highlighted in the mid&hyphen;year economic review. It is difficult at times to always meet forecasts. The government is very fond of abusing us for not reaching some of our forecasts with respect to the outcomes in the 1995-96 financial year. But I remind the Senate that the failure to meet forecasts was, at least in a number of very significant areas, as a consequence of failure to meet projected tax revenue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government got caught up in an identical problem when it was revealed that the company tax collection would be some $3 billion short. This has led to a significant problem for the government because, on finding out that they were $3 billion short, they have to find additional revenue if they are to meet their budget targets over the next two financial years. I was a little surprised and very concerned that&mdash;and this is obvious to me&mdash;the government, in attempting to meet, in part, the shortfall in company taxes, will take the money from superannuation. It will take the money that the government committed at the election&mdash;the superannuation payment&mdash;to put into low and middle income earners' accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very grave concern to Labor. This was reflected in the other place today. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) put the final nail in the coffin in question time in the House of Representatives today. To meet their budget shortfall, they will take money out of workers' superannuation. They will not pay the money into low and middle income earners' accounts. This will have a significant effect on the final retirement income of Australian workers. A person on an average wage and receiving superannuation for 30 to 35 years will be short&hyphen;changed by this government by approximately $100,000. That equates to a figure, on current annuity rates, of $6,000 to $7,000 a year less they will receive in retirement if it is paid as a pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very short&hyphen;sighted policy approach of the government. Not only is it a blatant breach of the election commitment given by the government and reaffirmed by the Treasurer on 22 August, but we have seen the monumental hypocrisy of the Treasurer in saying that, in part, he cannot deliver because of the administrative difficulties. Yet we have gone through the greatest difficulties in understanding the government's approach to its so-called surcharge. That is another debate for tomorrow. We have seen the hypocrisy of the government in its approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 173 errors in the mid&hyphen;year economic review were not just minor errors. When I picked up the figures I had a look at the corrigendum. One would expect when there 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2455"> were revised tables that there might have been a few major figures here, additional errors, some figures left out and some corrections. They were the sort of errors that one would expect in the document, and that is not unusual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not talking in these 173 errors of $100,000 here or $1 million there. For example, the entire government debt had to be revised upwards by $1.2 billion or $1.3 billion. We are not talking about insignificant errors. There were a range of significant errors amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars right through the papers dealing in areas such as health and education. These errors occurred in this much&hyphen;vaunted mid&hyphen;year economic review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not got the time to go extensively over the numerous other problems that have emerged for the government in the general budget area, the mid&hyphen;year economic review and the estimates. I could talk for a considerable time&mdash;I have talked for a considerable time tonight and I am anticipating, unfortunately, having to talk for a considerable time tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have one other point that I will conclude on. The mid&hyphen;year economic review is a bit like the government's changes last night to correct the problem they got with the constitutionality of their surcharge. They did not put out a press release to admit they got it wrong. The corrigendum that the government released was not publicly released. There were 4,000 copies stuck in Sydney. The press did not know this until we informed them at the estimates committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government is attempting to hide the corrigendum with all the errors and the constitutional problems with the surcharge. Attempting to cover up in very significant areas&mdash;these cover&hyphen;ups were exposed by the Labor opposition&mdash;has made the situation worse. It has shown that it is monumentally incompetent and, to add insult to injury, is at least to the Australian community and to the media not honest. I could talk about the charter of budget honesty. I will not be unkind. It is Senator Short's last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a significant number of matters that we could refer to. As I said earlier, we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have got a big program to get on with. I am conscious of my leader's instructions. He is always trying to assist and cooperate, and so am I. He is giving me the wind-up signal. So with that contribution I conclude my remarks.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me be brief in my contribution to this important second reading debate on the Commonwealth service delivery agency bills. These bills establish a new agency or one-stop shop for the delivery of Commonwealth services. The services of Social Security, Veterans' Affairs, the Commonwealth Employment Service, some Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, and Health and Family Services services will all be accessible through this new agency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to point out that the Labor opposition does not have a problem with the concept of a one-stop shop. We did make this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2456"> clear in our minority report on this legislation. We do see the advantages in customers dealing with a single agency to access a range of Commonwealth payments and services rather than a number of different departments. But that is not what is going to happen now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one-stop shop that this government is setting up is one that is very different to the one that was envisaged by Labor. These bills are a cover for the slashing of Commonwealth services, in particular the gutting of comprehensive services of the Commonwealth Employment Service. It is part of the government's agenda to sell off vital job services to private sector providers for profit and send us back to the era of fee charging employment agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this legislation, the new agency will provide only very basic registration, assessment, referral and self-help services to job seekers. Other essential employment assistance previously universally or freely available from the CES will not be provided by the new agency. Instead, it will be limited to particular classes of job seekers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have grave concerns about what exactly the agency will do in the future. The government says that the agency will deliver social security payments and services, Austudy and child-care assistance. But the definition of `Commonwealth service' does not limit the agency to the delivery of cash transfers. The agency could, for example, become the payment agency for Medicare or the regulating body for the aged care sector. We have formulated amendments to address these concerns by limiting the nature of the service arrangements which the agency might enter into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other concerns we raised in our minority report went to the issue of specialist knowledge held by staff. We are very concerned that Labor's initiatives when in government to develop specialist service centres&mdash;for example, for families and older Australians&mdash;may be jeopardised by the creation of a single service delivery agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, we fear the quality of services in regional, rural and remote areas of Australia may be compromised. While Senator Newman has claimed that `the agency will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> improve the services to rural and remote Australia', we know the reality is that the CES offices all over regional Australia are being shut down, along with the slashing of funding for regional employment programs. At the same time, regional unemployment figures are skyrocketing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing in this bill that gives assurances or guarantees that services to regional Australia will not be compromised&mdash;let alone improved. Senator Newman's only assurances are that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regions where there are currently no social security offices, the Agency may&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">`may', not `will'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">take over some offices that are part of the Commonwealth Employment Service Network.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is not only about the withdrawal of services from regional Australia but also about the loss of job opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The quality of service delivery for working families will be jeopardised. The decision to pay child&hyphen;care assistance directly to families, rather than to child&hyphen;care centres as it has been, is supposed to empower parents with more choice in the type of child care and which centre they use. While the issuing of child&hyphen;care payments through the agency is, in itself, a seemingly logical and sensible proposal, the government's proposal is part of a package of savage cuts to child care: abolishing operational subsidies for community based child care; placing a 50&hyphen;hour cap on the hours per week for which parents can claim child&hyphen;care assistance; means testing the child&hyphen;care cash rebate; abolishing the additional income allowed for additional dependent children; and freezing all child&hyphen;care payments for two years. Paying child&hyphen;care assistance directly to families through the agency, rather than directly to child&hyphen;care centres, jeopardises the high quality and standard of child care that families have come to expect in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to point out that this bill allows the agency to employ staff outside the Public Service Act on terms and conditions set by the board. The critical issue here was pointed out by the CPSU and highlighted in our minority report: we could have people within the agency under different categories of employment performing the same levels of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2457"> work for different pay and condition outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We certainly do not buy the arguments that have been put forward by the Department of Social Security, during the committee hearings and through their submission, that the present Public Service Act in any way hinders their capacity to employ temporary staff to deal with peak period workloads. The department already has to deal with peak workloads, and the agency should be able to do so under the same terms and conditions. We will be moving amendments to omit the provision relating to the authority of the agency to employ staff outside the provisions of the Public Service Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me close, in this all too brief contribution, by making two critical points. Firstly, Labor shares, I hope with the coalition, concern that people using the social security system and other Commonwealth services be treated with the respect and the dignity that they deserve. The government claims that the agency will provide a better service for all Australians, and I sincerely hope that it does. Let me assure you, and let me assure the minister, that we will be watching these developments very closely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we on this side of the chamber know that there is a vast gulf between the government's rhetoric and the reality of government policies. We saw it in the last budget; I have no doubt that we will see it in the next budget. The creation of the agency should not be about downgrading the Commonwealth services that you have an obligation to provide, and if you, the government, use it to this purpose, then the Australian people will hold you accountable.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME><STATE> (Queensland)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(11.41 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the name suggests, the bill before us tonight will establish the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency. Initially, the new agency will deal with a number of payments which are made separately at the present time. It will deal with income support payments made by the Department of Social Security; various functions of the Commonwealth Employment Service; student assistance payments made by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Affairs; and the provision of child&hyphen;care rebates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is envisaged that the agency will take on further Commonwealth department functions at a later stage. Overall, the notion of providing a one&hyphen;stop shop for Commonwealth services has been fairly well received and the Democrats will be supporting this bill as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are optimistic that the establishment of the new agency may go some of the way to reducing the maze of complexity that faces many social security recipients when they deal with the department. It will, for example, eliminate the need for an unemployed person to go to the CES to register as unemployed and then go to the DSS&mdash;often in a different building and sometimes in a different town&mdash;to claim their unemployment payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also has the potential to eliminate some of the communication breakdowns between DSS and the CES that unemployed people occasionally find themselves caught between. Hopefully, another thing it might do is break down some of the empire argy&hyphen;bargy that went on previously between Social Security and the CES. I thought it was unfortunate when some of that power struggle was happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The setting up of the new agency is not without its risks, however, and I indicate now that the Democrats will be supporting a number of ALP amendments which address issues identified at the community affairs committee inquiry on this bill. I say to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) that we did not have a chance to have that briefing, so I have to indicate to you that is where we are. If we do not get to the committee stage this evening, I do not know whether we can still have it. But I certainly want to indicate that is our current situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do believe that the amendments will more clearly define the agency's role. They will make ministerial directions given to the agency more open and they will ensure that the working conditions of the agency's staff are protected. That is a concern for us because we have had a number of calls over the past week from both DSS and DEETYA staff who are feeling very unsure about their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2458"> futures under the new agency, and I think that is particularly so for CES staff. I hope the minister might address those concerns in her reply because at the moment they seem to be very real. I understand that DEETYA staff are much more secure than CES staff are under this new arrangement&mdash;at least that is the feeling they have. If the minister can address that, that would be very helpful to them, I am sure. I wonder whether the minister could provide some reassurance and protection for those people when we come to the amendments in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other issues that I also raised with some of the minister's staff when I had a briefing with them was one that the Democrats have run with for a long time. I know various groups such as the Welfare Rights Centre have made this suggestion on a number of occasions, and it is one that the minister may be prepared to take up. Now that there is going to be a one-stop shop, something simple which would be of further assistance to people who attend one-stop shops would be a single application form. I wonder whether the minister might take that on board. Obviously there will need to be some sorting out, but the idea is that there would be a single form which would supply fundamental details, such as a person's name and address and some of the financial details et cetera, and then staff of the one-stop shop would be able to direct people in relation to what further information is required for the appropriate pension or benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats were also concerned about some of the privacy issues involved in the establishment of the new agency and in particular the risks associated with holding a large amount of personal information in the one office&mdash;information which has been collected from a number of different departments. This issue was raised in the submission made by the Privacy Commissioner to the community affairs committee inquiry. I understand, however, that the department has been consulting with the Privacy Commissioner and the minister will be providing the Senate with an undertaking which addresses those privacy concerns. I simply put on record that this is one aspect of the new agency's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> performance that the Democrats will be monitoring as closely as we can. The Democrats hope the establishment of the new agency will lead to improved service to the public, not just in metropolitan areas but also in rural and regional centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, there is a concern. At the moment the child&hyphen;care rebate, for example, is paid in some areas through Medicare agencies. I wonder whether the minister would be able to tell us the government's contingency plans for the areas which do not have a one-stop shop close by that people can access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, we were pleased to see that the Department of Social Security has indicated a commitment to retaining all its current specialist services, including services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, to people with a disability, to young people, to sole parents and to people in remote areas. The Democrats will be supporting this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief, given the pressures that are being applied to us all to ensure that the program is progressed as quickly as possible in these last couple of sitting days. I wanted to very briefly touch upon what I think is an inevitable consequence of the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill. It is hard to discuss this bill without considering also the reform of employment services bill and the impact that it will have. The Service Delivery Agency, which Senator Faulkner has already spoken of in terms of our in principle support, will be part of a program to replace the CES's universal provision of a labour exchange service. It is the disappearance of that service which is of great concern to the Labor Party. If this bill were passed with the maintenance of that service, there would be a lot less disquiet about this proposal. Nevertheless, the Labor Party will be moving amendments which have been enumerated in the minority report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are amendments, firstly, to ensure that the Service Delivery Agency cannot both provide a service and regulate or independently monitor that service in the conduct of its functions; secondly, to require that any ministerial notification of the general policies of the Commonwealth government that are to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2459"> apply in relation to that agency and the board or the employees be published in the agency's annual report&mdash;that was in relation to a concern about the legislation permitting the minister to require the board to observe the general policies of the government without that requirement to publish; thirdly, to require the board of the Service Delivery Agency to seek advice from the Remuneration Tribunal about the terms and conditions under which the chief executive officer holds office and to publish this advice in the agency's annual report; and, fourthly, to omit the provisions allowing the chief executive officer to employ staff outside the provisions of the Public Service Act, which was referred to by Senator Faulkner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a great many aspects of the legislation which deserve some attention. I see that the minister is not quite in a position to address this matter. I indicate that I will not make any further comments in the interests of the expeditious passage of this piece of legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the speakers tonight for their contributions and for the support which they are prepared to give this innovative way of providing customer service to people accessing services from the Commonwealth. I also appreciate the brevity of the contributions so that it is possible to get this piece of legislation completed tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is very much committed to providing service to our customers. That is very much the ethos we are trying to develop. A number of measures which have been trialled in this past year will be important in setting the scene for the new direction of the agency, making it a more pleasant place to work for staff because their customers will be less unhappy, fractious, worried and aggressive. The measures to encourage point of conduct decision making will mean a more satisfying job for staff. It will also mean quicker outcomes for customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appointment system, which is already in place in a number of regional offices, is already leading to better relations between the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> customers and the staff. I have been visiting regional offices regularly, as I have said before in this place, and wherever I go I consistently find that the staff of DSS are looking very positively at the way ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also point out to Senator Woodley and Senator Faulkner that, when I have been able to, I have made a point of talking to the union delegate in each regional office about the way ahead, and they have acknowledged that the staff in their office, almost without exception, are looking forward very positively to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to address one other issue that Senator Woodley raised about the CES. I recognise that there have been concerns from some of the CES people that they were moving into a new organisation where, essentially, they would be the minority element in the staff. In some of the regional offices that I have visited, I have also spoken to CES staff who have moved across. Constantly, I have been pleased to find in their voices the surprise at, and the pleasure they have found from, Social Security staff welcoming them and supporting them. They are enjoying the new work environment. They recognise, as do the Social Security staff, that it is going to mean much better outcomes for our mutual customers. I thank the Senate for the support which they are prepared to give to this legislation. I think it is going to be a much better outcome for the customers and for the staff who serve them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And for my charm, as Senator Newman says. Amendment 1, standing in my name, ensures that the agency 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> effectively cannot both provide a service and regulate or independently monitor that service. This amendment is about drawing a boundary around what the agency can and cannot do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition have asked questions on a number of occasions to establish exactly which Commonwealth services the government intends the agency to provide. It seems&mdash;as with so many other matters with this government&mdash;that there are core functions and there are non-core functions. Core functions, like delivering social security payments and services and Austudy and child-care assistance, are those that are set out in the various documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But every now and then the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) seems to add a new one&mdash;for example, domiciliary nursing payments, which was announced on Radio FiveAA in Adelaide at the end of February. What about child support? What about aged care subsidies? What are the limits to what the agency might do?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendment ensures that there are some things that the agency will not be able to do. Perhaps we could use an analogy that the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) might find topical. The agency should not be able to be both the ABC and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. It should not be able to be both, say, a commercial television station and the Advertising Standards Council. It should not be able to be both the provider of nursing home benefits and the body which determines which nursing home beds should go where.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Though I often argue that analogy is a poor form of argument, and I am not noted for mounting poor forms of argument in the chamber, I think that we should use an example closer to home: the agency should be specifically precluded from being both the deliverer of social security payments and the Social Security Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) The original source for all data on merchandise exports published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is information provided on export entries reported to the Australian Customs Service (ACS). 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The original data are generated by exporters and reported by them or their agents via the Custom's export reporting database (EXIT) system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) The original data are reported to the ACS, by exporters or their agents, initially prior to the shipment of the goods. At this stage, exporters are required to provide, among other things, estimates in terms of long green tonnes and bone dry units. Once the woodchips are loaded onto the ship, actual measurements, in terms of long green tonnes and bone dry units, are made as explained in 2(c) and (d) below. Exporters are then required to advise ACS of any revisions to their original estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) All export entries (including revisions) reported to ACS are processed and passed to ABS the following business day via a direct electronic communications link. Therefore, published data for any particular month will be based on exporters' initial estimates, where final estimates are not available in time for publication, or final estimates where these have been received. Where initial estimates have been published, revised estimates are published in subsequent months as necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) The original data are required to be reported in terms of green long tonnes and bone dry units. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Green long tonne refers to the weight of the woodchips or particles when shipped. One long tonne is equivalent to 2,240 lb. A bone dry unit is the quantity of woodchips or particles equivalent to 2,400 lb of the oven dry wood substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) and (d) The measurement of green long tonnes on each ship is calculated on the basis of the volume of water displaced. This measurement is made by an independent marine surveyor who conducts an International Standard Draft Survey. The measurement of bone dry units is made by taking a sample of each shipment, weighing it, oven drying it to remove all moisture, and weighing it again. This measurement is made by the exporter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) and (f) For any particular shipment, the volume of water remaining in the chips depends on the species of wood and the season. Overall, the measurement in bone dry units is approximately 50 per cent of the measurement in green long tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (a) No automatic adjustments or conversions are made to the original data by the ABS or any Commonwealth or State agency in generating the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2463"> ABS reported data. However, the ABS applies various edit checks to records received from ACS to detect possible errors. If data are found to be incorrect, the ABS amends the data. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) See the response to 2(b) above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Yes. The ABS applies edit checks to the data, investigates inconsistencies and if necessary amends records after contact with the exporter or agent. In addition, inaccuracies in published data are sometimes detected by users of the statistics with industry expertise who alert the ABS about their concerns. This can result in ABS querying exporters and, where necessary, amending the data.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Exporters are also required to report export data on hardwood woodchips derived from native forests on a commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence basis directly to the Woodchip Export Monitoring Unit (WEMU) of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE) (which formally commenced operation on 1 January 1996), solely for the purpose of monitoring compliance with hardwood woodchip export licence conditions restricting export volumes. For the 1996 licence year, the data were verified by random audits of exporters by independent consultants engaged by WEMU. For the 1997 licence year, exporters are required to provide to WEMU audited statements in relation to this data.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON>
