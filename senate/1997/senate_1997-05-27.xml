<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Newman, the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services. Minister, how do you explain the fact that the only results from your government's $1.7 billion public health insurance incentives package have been a continuous and growing exodus from private health insurance and continuing increases in private health insurance premiums? Minister, isn't your $1.7 billion investment aimed at increasing the numbers in private health insurance and reducing premiums? If so, why is your policy proving to be such a colossal and costly failure?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3731" SPEAKER="Newman, Sen Jocelyn" NAMEID="BE4" ELECTORATE="TAS" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Social Security; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question should have been: why is such a policy necessary? The policy is necessary because 13 years of quite deliberate running down of the private sector has meant that the Medicare scheme was set up by its founders with a substantial reliance on people who could afford to support themselves in terms of health care. That was the way Labor set it up. Those who had the stewardship of Medicare over the succeeding 12 years or so in fact let the founders&mdash;the architects of the scheme&mdash;down. The architects understood very well that, without a substantial proportion of people insuring themselves, the public system would be
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> overburdened. So the question, of course, was the wrong question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Health and Family Services has pointed out that there has in fact been a disappointing decline to 32.5 per cent of participation rates in private health insurance in the March quarter. I well remember, during the time that I was shadow health minister, pointing out similar declines to successive health ministers. It did not make much difference&mdash;under Labor, nothing was done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decline from 33.2 per cent in the previous quarter is not unusual when compared with the March quarter trend over the last several years. Such a decrease is hardly surprising, Senator, given that during the March quarter a very senior member of the Australian Medical Association made the irresponsible claim that people were better off without private insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the opposition, and particularly the member for Dobell, continue to publicly badmouth private health insurance every chance they get in order simply to get cheap political mileage without thought of what it is doing to the health care of the nation. For a political party that did everything they possibly could while they were in government to destroy private health insurance, it is simply astounding to see that they have suddenly developed an interest in the subject. I will remind them that they had a Prime Minister who gloated in the fact that he was reliant on the public system, he and all five of his dependants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dobell has recently claimed that the government's private health insurance incentives scheme has failed. The fact that seems to escape the member for Dobell is that the scheme has not yet started: it starts on 1 July this year, and to say that it has failed before it has even started defies commonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that these incentives will make private health insurance more affordable for those members of the health funds who most need assistance in paying their premiums. Putting the money into the public system, as the member for Dobell seems to advocate, will do nothing for those people nor will it
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3732"> help restore the necessary balance between the public and the private health systems which, as I said at the beginning, was the original architecture of this scheme. It relied on the twin pillars of public and private financing of the health system.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, your scheme is an incentive one, one designed to attract people back into private health insurance or to stay in health insurance. Minister, you have been in government for over 12 months now. Is it not true that the 0.7 per cent drop in the number of people with private health insurance in the March quarter is the highest quarterly drop for two years? Is it not true that, during this same period, your government has continued to approve massive increases in health insurance premiums, in some cases in excess of 22 per cent?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3732" SPEAKER="Newman, Sen Jocelyn" NAMEID="BE4" ELECTORATE="TAS" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Social Security; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think the senator understands how health funds operate. Under the legislation which they introduced and managed&mdash;or mismanaged, according to your perspective&mdash;over succeeding years, they were required to see that the health insurance funds did not fail. They had to retain by law a percentage of their reserves so that claims made by their members could be honoured.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am wondering whether the senator would have had the minister for health refuse to approve those requests for increase. The previous government never knocked anything back; they did not even have any sense that the funds should be protected. Nevertheless, if we are going to make sure that the members of health funds do get what they insure themselves for, the premium increases have to be approved. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer. Minister, the budget forecasts continuing strong growth in business investment over 1997-98. Will you inform the Senate of the results of today's ABS capital expenditure survey and their consistency with the budget forecast and longer term benefits of investment in this country? </PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Gibson, for that important question. The government is very pleased indeed about the investment outlook for this country. Strong investment growth now provides the wherewithal for strong future growth and activity and jobs and by building up Australia's stock of capital goods and infrastructure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is very pleased that this investment is occurring in a period where low inflation has been entrenched. Low inflation means that investment is now more likely to be based on sustainable factors, producing real value rather than speculative investments of the type we witnessed too often, I believe, in the late 1980s. Today's ABS March quarter capital expenditure survey referred to by Senator Gibson is very welcome news on the investment front. It supports the budget forecast of continuing strong investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The data released today show that new capital expenditure has risen 18.6 per cent over the year to March, which is simply a sensational figure&mdash;no question about it&mdash;and total business investment in the March quarter was the highest recorded since the survey's inception in 1987. They also show that the second estimate of expected capital expenditure in 1997-98 is 15 per cent higher than the first estimate taken earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the government's policies are helping to provide a better environment for business to plan and invest. Firstly, we are putting in place responsible budgetary policies and, by working towards balancing the budget, we are of course taking pressure off interest rates. We are also reforming Australia's outdated and inefficient industrial relations system with the Workplace Relations Act and, by removing small business employers from the unfair dismissal provisions, there should be a further boost for employing in small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are providing significant tax relief to small business, including of course reducing the provisional tax uplift factor, freeing small business from capital gains tax on the rollover of assets on businesses and, of course, we have kept our promise not to raise taxes or increase existing taxes. In short, we are providing business with a vastly improved
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3733"> environment for investment and to assist in the creation of jobs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam President. Senator Ian Macdonald asked whether the supplementary will be in the form of an apology. I would think that it would probably be a bit too much to ask when it is very clear that there has been a concerted campaign, particularly by Labor women, in conjunction with the child&hyphen;care union and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3734"> union members. There has been a gross and mischievous misrepresentation of the government's position to parents. It is cruel. It is one more example of the way this opposition treats people who may find it difficult to get information because of the barrage of misinformation coming from the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thanks to the opposition's little exercise on parents, there would be very few people who realise that the amount of money spent on child care in the first year of this government went from just over $1 billion under the Keating government to $1.1 billion in the first year. That is an increase of $100 million or a 10 per cent increase over the previous year. This year the funding on child care will be $1.146 billion and over the next four years this government is going to spend $4.8 billion. Child care is to continue to grow at three per cent real growth in each of the next four years. How many people would know, if they listened to the Labor women, that since coming to office we have created 31,222 new child&hyphen;care places at a full&hyphen;year cost of $86 million.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They do not want the public to hear the truth. That is the trouble, Madam President. In addition, we have made available a further $31 million over four years to ensure that children with high levels of additional needs get appropriate access to child&hyphen;care options, options that they were kept from during the years of the Labor government. Those are hardly the actions of a government that is trying to cut child care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the previous government, there was an unplanned, unchecked growth in child care that did not supply the need. There was an oversupply in some areas, an under supply in others, and that has created viability problems for a number of child&hyphen;care centres. The Minister for Family Services, Mrs Moylan, has provided substantial dollars to help those child&hyphen;care centres get advice so as to make their businesses viable and continue to thrive.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has also consulted widely and developed a national planning framework for child care, something, again, which the previous government did not do with parents and child&hyphen;care centres. In addition, a number of services have had excessive charging practices in place. The government is determined to establish a high&hyphen;quality child&hyphen;care system that remains flexible, affordable and accessible to families so as to enable parents to participate in the work force, if that is their choice. It is not the government's role to subsidise child&hyphen;care centres whose charging practices are excessive or inefficient.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to have escaped the senator's notice that her government was paying for child care and getting the taxpayer, therefore, to subside child care for hours that were not being used by any children at all. If you think that is being harsh, it is not our idea of being harsh: you have to be fair to the taxpayer as well as fair to the families out there earning an income and needing child care. In relation to the 50 hour cap that the senator referred to in her question, in fact, we announced in the last budget that most women with young children who work part time do not use five days of care. In addition, only 10 per cent of all centres around Australia are open for 60 hours or more a week.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The arts is indeed a fundamental aspect of Aboriginal culture and there can be no doubt that, if one were to want to ensure a way of reconciling the past and the present&mdash;and indeed the future&mdash;in terms of Aboriginal spirituality, the arts would provide the best opportunity for doing that. Many of the dreaming stories, the mythologies, the morals and the beliefs of Aboriginal people are increasingly finding their way into permanent art forms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very important to recognise that, since that 1967 referendum, it is only about 25 years since Geoffrey Bardon established an art school at Papunya that led to the modern notion of desert art which, I think, has captured the imagination not only of all Australians, both indigenous and non&hyphen;indigenous, but also of very many people overseas who come to this country and increasingly regard Aboriginal arts and culture as a vitally important memento of their visits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something of the order of 50 per cent of tourist spending in this country&mdash;in other words about $100 million a year&mdash;is currently spent on Aboriginal arts and craft, and that is why it is very important indeed that the Australian government should support, in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> every possible way, the emergence and the flowering and the development of Aboriginal art in its various manifestations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, I can say from personal experience that, at Lajamanu, for example, a few years ago there were problems in funding the Aboriginal art coordinators. The place was basically falling to pieces. ATSIC, to its credit, was able to find additional funding and, as a result, the new coordinator there, Brent Hocking, who is only in his early 20s, has been able to discover a means, by putting on discos, of raising something of the order of $2,000 a week which goes into recycling and promoting Aboriginal art. If you have seen the works of Abie Jangala, for example, Madam President, you would very much appreciate the quality of work that can come from very remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government certainly is very supportive in a number of areas. That is why, unlike our predecessors, we are pressing ahead with the National Museum, why we allocated $7 million in the recent budget and why we have committed something of the order, in indicative terms, of $133 million to see the completion of that very important major project. An integral part of that, in conjunction with the aspects relating to Australian society and history and our interaction with the environment, will be the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural and heritage elements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The gallery of Aboriginal Australia will not only be a significant part of the National Museum but it will be located on the same site. This is very much in accordance with the wishes of the locals, who see that as symbolising an important step in the reconciliation process. The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies will also be co&hyphen;located with the National Museum. The cultural industry development program, with pilot projects such as those orchestrated by Desart in central Australia and ANCA in Arnhem Land, are again very important aspects and are very much supported by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of copyright, we are currently developing a framework for the protection of indigenous intellectual property. We violently opposed the attempts of Paul Keating and his

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in a number of very important ways, we are acknowledging the unique contribution of Aboriginal art and Aboriginal culture.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one more year in an out&hyphen;year of an interim housing agreement so, Senator Faulkner, you should get yourself well informed first. It is important, when we have so many examples of misinformation being put out by the opposition, including misuse of the Senate in using false figures, that it be very clearly on the record what the true situation is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interim housing agreement was for three years. We have already finished one year and we have two years left to go. The funding savings for this year are $50 million and they are the same for next year. That has been communicated not only in the budget but
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in subsequent correspondence between the Prime Minister and the premiers. The Prime Minister has also met with the premiers on a couple of occasions over the last year as well which, perhaps, has escaped people's memories. There was a COAG meeting last year, there was a premiers meeting subsequent to that and there were negotiations that took place in both those fora as to how savings would be made to contribute to dealing with the deficit which we inherited from the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the enormous job that we had to do on taking over the national accounts, the states have made their contribution in a number of ways. They negotiated with the Prime Minister on where they would find the savings which would contribute to the national effort. It is very important to understand that, for example, the community housing groups, like ecumenical housing, as well as most of the state ministers, have expressed some satisfaction that the savings taken from the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement were limited to $50 million and, in addition, that the Prime Minister, in writing to the premiers on the eve of the budget, also set out their entitlements for not only the totality of this year but also for next year. The concern was to establish certainty in the funding for the remainder of the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement and to have a minimal savings measure out of housing. Those who know anything about the $1 billion&mdash;$1,000 million&mdash;contribution by the Commonwealth to the states for housing would understand that, in that context, $50 million is a very small saving indeed.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that is a deliberate misunderstanding. Maybe it is not deliberate; maybe it is a genuine misunderstanding of the proposal that was being placed by the Commonwealth to the states last year for reform in housing. The

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Stott Despoja. The Prime Minister's announcement with respect to privacy included the announcement that the services of the Privacy Commissioner would be made available to assist business in the development of voluntary codes and to meet privacy standards. I have not been advised of any change to that, but I do have some information from the Attorney on how one might proceed to actually implement that in an effective way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These ideas were canvassed by the Attorney at a banking law and practice conference on
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 22 May. One approach to developing a voluntary approach to privacy protection in the private sector would be to continue to develop such codes for particular sectors or to cover particular functions. Alternatively, you could have one overall set of privacy principles appropriate for application across the entire private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first approach&mdash;which is really an incremental one&mdash;if that were to be pursued, there would be advantages in pursuing functional rather than sectoral codes. By functional codes, the Attorney means codes applying to a particular type of information or a particular use of information rather than those focusing on who in particular was using it. Nonetheless, that choice would be there. Functional codes are better suited to having continued relevance to an evolving private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second approach is that an overall set of privacy principles might be an even better approach at least as a first step. That would involve a uniform privacy standard across the entire private sector. Consumers could expect the same essential privacy protection in relation to all dealings with the private sector. Businesses would know that all players, even their direct competitors, would be playing by the same rules. Such an overall set of privacy principles would also provide a basic starting point should the development of more detailed codes specifically addressing issues relevant to particular types of information or functions later prove desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That overall approach is the one that has been taken in Canada. Under the auspices of the Canadian Standards Association, a committee developed a model code for the protection of personal information. The committee was made up of a wide range of business, consumer and government representatives. It included people from the Canadian Bankers Association, insurance groups, the Canadian Direct Marketing Association, communications and information technology groups and consumer groups, such as the Consumers Association of Canada, the Public Interest Advocacy Centre and others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The model code was approved by the Canadian Standards Council as the national
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3744"> standard in December 1995 and, more recently, the Canadian Standards Association has proposed to the International Standards Organisation that it develop an international standard on privacy. Both our domestic experience to date in developing sectoral and functional codes and the Canadian experience must be taken into account in our pursuit of a voluntary approach to privacy protection in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Privacy Commissioner is currently meeting with business and consumer groups to discuss how she might facilitate the best voluntary approach to privacy for Australia at this point in time. I am sure the Attorney would extend to you, Senator Stott Despoja, the invitation he extended to delegates at the conference&mdash;that is, he would encourage you to make your views known to the Privacy Commissioner.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), to a question without notice asked by Senator Forshaw today, relating to private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The policies of this government are driving the health industry and the health sector in this country into absolute crisis. After they were elected and during their first budget last year, the government claimed that their initiatives would encourage people back into private health insurance. This government actually ripped out about $1.7 billion from spending in order to provide this private health insurance initiative. They cut back massively in payments to the states for hospitals. They wound up the dental health scheme and, of course, they are looking at closing a large number of Medicare offices. That is just a small amount of what this government have in mind in terms of cutbacks in health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, claimed that his scheme to provide a $450 a year rebate for persons who took out or retained their private health insurance would bring people running back in to join private health funds. Of course, that has been an absolute failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have a proposal&mdash;it has been put time and time again but apparently the minister and the government do not under
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stand this&mdash;to encourage people to join private health funds and pay about $1,500 to $2,000 a year for family cover so they get a rebate of $450 a year. It defies logic as to why that sort of initiative would encourage people to go and spend at least three or four times the amount of the rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we know, the reason why people are dropping out of private health insurance is that they do not actually see that it is value for money, particularly when, having paid such high premiums, there is still in many cases a huge gap between what they ultimately have to pay for the service and the refund they get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In her answer, Senator Newman tried to belittle the question that I asked by saying, `Look, the scheme hasn't even started yet. It doesn't start until 1 July this year.' That is really begging the question. It is a nonsense answer. The whole purpose of this scheme was an incentive. It was supposed to encourage people from the time of the last budget to rejoin a private health fund or take out health insurance for the first time, and down the track in one year's time they would be able to access this $450 rebate. So it is no answer to suggest that, because the scheme has not started, it is too early to judge it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that, notwithstanding the fact that people knew or know that this $450 rebate is in the pipeline for them, they are not taking steps to join private health funds. The latest figures that came out from the March quarter showed a further 0.7 per cent drop in the number of people in private health funds. We are talking here about thousands upon thousands of people dropping out of private health insurance. It is now down to something in the order of 32.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a minister who said that his scheme was actually going to lead to a 35 per cent increase in the number of people in private health insurance, but the trend is actually continuing to head, and is actually heading, downwards at a greater rate. The last reduction was the greatest reduction in private health insurance membership in the last two years.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3749">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I conclude by saying that this minister, not satisfied with seeing that his policies are not working, goes out and looks for scapegoats. He attacked the AMA and he has attacked people in the private health sector. On Wednesday, 21 May, in answer to a question about this continuing decline, he said, `What you're seeing happen here is a fallout from all the arguing and disagreement between these galahs in the private health sector.' He actually referred to the private health sector as being full of galahs. This is a minister who, on the one hand, is trying to encourage people to join private health funds, yet, on the other hand, he is publicly attacking the spokespersons and people in the private health sector as being galahs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is absolutely amazing that we are having this debate taking note of an answer to a question that was just so inane that one just shakes one's head. It comes from a party that was in government for 13 years and which presided over the biggest drop in private health insurance cover this country has ever seen. What their policies did was ensure that the coverage of those privately health insured dropped from over 60 per cent down to around 30 per cent and now they have got the gall to come in here and criticise incentives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is only a couple of weeks ago that we had supplementary estimates hearings, and admittedly Senator Forshaw has only recently taken over some degree of responsibility in the Labor Party for this portfolio. But it was breathtaking to listen to the inane questions that were being asked about the increases in private health insurance premiums. But the fact remains that Senator Forshaw was unaware, until I asked the question in supplementary estimates hearings, that no request for premium increases was ever rejected by the former Labor Party government. At that time Senator Forshaw went into orbit at the mere fact that I had the temerity to ask questions&mdash;in a committee that I happened to chair&mdash;because he did not like the answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been no change whatsoever to the process. There has been no change to the application period. There has been no change
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to anything in terms of the approval process, other than it now has to get direct ministerial approval to make sure that the request is legitimate. Under the Labor Party there was no such ministerial assurance. The request came in and it was granted. Now they have the gall to also criticise a government initiative that is ensuring that people have an incentive if they are on low incomes to take out private health insurance and they are penalised by an extra one per cent Medicare levy if they are on high incomes and choose not to take out private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what are they saying? `Shouldn't have an incentive.' Yet here they are responsible for 13 years of degradation of private health insurance membership and they have the courage to come in here and make fools of themselves in terms of what is going on at present and the incentives that have been put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly this Labor Party could not give a crumpet about the fact that there are people queuing in public hospitals while private hospital beds are at times only a third or half full. Those opposite could not care less. They do not want to have any incentive for people to get back into private health insurance and, if they did want to have an incentive, first and foremost they would have done something about it in 13 years of disastrous government. Secondly, they would be supporting the initiative now. But no, we get this carping criticism; carping criticism day after day after day that it is not good enough. Not only that, but we get the carping criticism about the closure of Medicare offices. Do Senator Forshaw, Senator Neal or anybody for that matter in the Labor Party bother to remind themselves&mdash;or actually tell the facts of the matter in debate&mdash;that what the government has done is make it easier for people to claim their Medicare rebates by doing it through pharmacies? No. Let's not tell to whole truth and nothing but the truth. Let's only say that Medicare offices are closing. That is the whole tactic of the Labor Party: let's distort the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have sat through all of these hearings. I have sat through the hearings on the funding of aged care. I have been absolutely and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3750"> utterly breathless to sit through both of them and just hear the absolute distortion of the facts that has gone on. Here today there is no difference, because sooner or later the Labor Party will have to admit that not one request for premium increases was ever rejected by them. The difference is that they offered no incentive to get into private health insurance. We are at least offering some incentive. Why do they not come on board and at least agree that it is going part the way there, instead of this constant carping criticism that they are becoming specialists at dishing out day after day?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we are going to talk about fallacies and distortion of the truth, truly Senator Newman, the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) in this place, and the previous speaker, Senator Patterson, have really taken the cake. This is a debate that did not start today; it started some years ago. Both I and Senator Knowles are a lot more aware of the facts than has been disclosed by anything that has been put forward today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first fallacy put forward by Senator Newman was that the previous Labor government did not care about private health insurance and that in fact they intentionally downgraded or dismantled the private health insurance industry during their period in government. Nothing could be further from the truth. Senator Knowles herself would have been involved in extensive debates and inquiries through the Community Affairs Committee in relation to the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill and the Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill introduced by Minister Lawrence during our term in government. This was very much based upon a view that there was a major role to be played by the private health insurance industry and that there was some value in encouraging participation in the private hospital scheme.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="B36">Senator NEAL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that this scheme did have some success and had some success
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with virtually a zero financial input by the federal government. The average drop or decline in participation in private health insurance over the last decade or so has been 0.4 per cent and the drop subsequent to that was just slightly over 0.2 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was never alleged that this was going to be a complete solution to the problem, but it certainly is an improvement on the situation that existed before that legislation went through. It is a clear indication that the previous government was familiar with the problem and was taking steps to combat it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we would all be aware, and I think Senator Eggleston in particular would be aware, the major problem with some of that legislation was that some doctors and the AMA together ensured that no doctors entered into contracts directly with private health insurers, and as a result the attempt by the government to actually restrain the cost of out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket expenses was defeated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the introduction of this new scheme there has not been an improvement in the decline in membership of the private health insurance schemes. In fact, there has been a major increase. The minister tried to put forward that a decline of 0.7 per cent in a quarter was some sort of average decline and therefore this was not anything extraordinary. But, as I have pointed out, the decline over the last decade or so has been an average of 0.4 per cent and that has dropped over the last couple of years to 0.2 per cent, so this 0.7 per cent in the March quarter is a substantial increase on the general trends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real tragedy of it is that, as well as being an indication of the complete failure of this latest scheme, it has been done at a great expense to the public health system. This scheme in total has cost this government, has cost the taxpayers of Australia, $1.7 billion&mdash;$600 million a year&mdash;and it has done absolutely nothing to improve the participation in private health insurance. In fact, that $1.7 billion has come directly out of our public health system. It has come out of the Commonwealth dental health program and it has come out of public hospitals, and that is the real tragedy: for zero benefit we have spent this much money.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3751">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One other fallacy I might mention while we are at it is one put by the previous speaker, Senator Knowles, that private hospitals are presently not being properly utilised.

If you think you can turn the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS> around in a year then think again. We have to undo 13 years of Labor's mismanagement. We are reminded over and over by our Treasurer (Mr Costello) that in the last five years of Labor they chalked up $70 billion worth of debt; that is, they spent $70 billion more than Australians were putting into the coffers. We had to borrow $70 billion; we were living beyond our means by $70 billion. Senator Forshaw and Senator Neal can get up here and bleat all they like about some of the cuts&mdash;and there were some cuts that were made in the last budget and this budget that of course we have not liked doing. But we cannot continue to live beyond our means, because what that means is that the next generation and the generation after that will be paying the debt forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Premier of New South Wales was recently wailing about the decline in the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proportion of the population which is privately insured and said that it necessitates a wide ranging inquiry into the health system. Mr Howard said yesterday, `When you have been around long enough you hear it all.' We hear it all when the Labor Premier of New South Wales is saying that private health insurance is a good idea. The Prime Minister asked yesterday in the House where the Premier of New South Wales was when Graham Richardson said in 1993:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a bare minimum we must try to stop the decline in private insurance. If the coverage gets any worse we will have huge problems with the queues in public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then it was 39 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1983, when Labor came to power, almost two&hyphen;thirds, over 60 per cent, of all Australians were privately insured. By 1996, after 13 years of Labor, this had fallen to 34 per cent. We had people like the then minister for health with no private insurance. We had people like the then Prime Minister with no private insurance. That was fine. When Mr Keating or Mrs Keating needed surgery they could take themselves off to a private hospital and pay for it&mdash;go to the top of the list and pay for it. And many of us here can do that; but many in the Australian community cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know you do not want to look at me, Madam Deputy President, because you do not like to hear what I have got to say. With that decline in health insurance, there was increased pressure on public hospitals. Senator  Crowley would stand over here and answer questions and claim there was not a correlation between those two things. There was a correlation and there was also a relationship of causation. With the decline in private health insurance, there was an increasing pressure on the public health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor said a lot about private health insurance and premium rises. In their term of office, what did they do to stop it? Nothing. Every premium increase was approved. What was the average rate of premium increases under Labor? Under Labor the average private health insurance premiums rose by 12 per
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3752"> cent a year, including a period in 1986&hyphen;88 in which many premiums rose by a whopping 40 per cent. This was a single burst of inflation which drove thousands of people from private health insurance and ensured that premiums continued upwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the outcome of that? The young and fit and those least at risk left private health insurance and left those of us more at risk&mdash;and I include myself in that, having had a total knee reconstruction&mdash;to stay in the private health insurance schemes and put a greater burden on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did Labor do to help private health insurance? At the end of the day it sought to destroy private health insurance, and the big bang premium increases in 1986&hyphen;88 were in large part the direct result of Labor's removing two important supports from private cover: the Commonwealth's bed day subsidy for private hospital beds and the Commonwealth contribution to the private health insurance reinsurance pool, which helped the funds average their risk.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's $1.7 billion private health insurance incentives package is nothing but an extremely expensive blunder. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) plans to give families a rebate of up to $250 for their private health cover but, at the same time, the private health funds have increased health insurance. The increases include Medibank Private up 23 per cent, Manchester Unity up 17.5 per cent and MBF up 15 per cent. This means families and couples are paying between $200 and $400 more than they were last August. The Medibank Private increase of $374 for top family cover in Victoria means that couples will be $125 worse off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can the minister guarantee that private health insurance premiums will not rise in the future? I very much doubt it. Why is the minister running away from the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to supervise all future increases? This $1.7 billion was
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stolen from the public system&mdash;$800 million from public hospitals, $500 million from the PBS, and more to come this year, and $400 million by abolishing the Commonwealth dental health program. How can this be justified when it comes to people's health?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $600 million a year being spent on these incentives could have been put to much better use in the public system. An average cost of around $200,000 a year could have funded an extra 3,000 hospital beds. At $3,000 per admission, more than half a million extra patients could have been admitted over three years. Would this not have been more beneficial to the people this government claims to represent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well for Dr Wooldridge, in a doorstop interview on 21 May, to blame the arguing and disagreeing of `these galahs in the private health sector' for the decline in the number of people covered by private health insurance. He thinks `more people will come back in and the drop out will stop once our incentives start'. But the reality is that 1,000 people per day are dropping out of private health insurance, and why shouldn't they. It is too expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister wants to blame his mistakes on the insurers, doctors and hospitals by accusing them of arguing amongst themselves for the past six months, but even Jeff Kennett said that the minister had sent $1.7 billion down the drain and that, if he really wanted to take pressure off waiting lists and public hospitals, he would have spent this money directly on patient care. This mania that the government persists with of destroying  Medicare and trying to force the people of Australia to belong to private health insurance schemes is drastically backfiring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, with the increases by private health funds came changes. These changes will force older Australians to pay more and/or wait longer to get health coverage. Who wants to join a health fund at $1,000 or more per year when there are varying degrees of waiting periods? They also allow funds to veto sick people applying for insurance and the changes make it harder to get coverage for palliative care and rehabilitation services. Surely health funds are there for the sick, not
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3753"> just to reap in the money. Why would people not leave in droves? They cannot afford it and the $450 rebate is a farce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these changes do is increase the pressure on the public health system instead of give Australians a decent health system, which they deserve. All we have here is a health policy which will go down in history as a political sham, but the problem is people will suffer in the meantime.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen a health system in Australia which catered basically for everybody with the private hospitals providing a lot of routine medical services and the public hospital system caring for the underprivileged and poor back in the 1970s and 1980s transformed into a system not unlike the state health services in Europe and the United Kingdom where there is a very low percentage of private health insurance, a very small private hospital sector, and a public hospital sector which simply is not able to cope with the demand placed on it by the fact that so many people in the population are seeking to use the public health sector because they do not have private health insurance. The government is trying to take some of the pressure off the public hospital system by encouraging people back into private health insurance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are on the way. It is a horrible mess. We are trying to do our best to correct it. The $1.76 billion package, which the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has announced, is a step towards encouraging people who can afford it to go back into private health insurance so that some of those long waiting lists in public hospitals, those overcrowded outpatient departments which we all know about, can be reduced and the people who can afford to take out private health insurance can go back into the private sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the commitments the Liberal government made when it came into office last year was to accept that the concept of universal health cover is something that the Australian people wanted to retain and, given that, the government has honoured its commitment to retain and keep the Medicare system. But the fact remains that one of the outcomes of Labor policy has been to create enormous pressure on public hospitals to the extent that the public hospital system in Australia simply cannot cope with the workload and that, if I might say, is a feature of state health systems all over the world. If you go to the UK, you will find that there are overcrowded hospitals with long waiting lists and that is because there is only a very small private hospital sector there and the public hospital system simply cannot cope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a very good system in this country prior to the introduction of Medicare. There was a nice combination of public and private medicine and people were treated quickly.  Instead of that we have imported all the problems of state medicine to Australia, which I think is an achievement which must make the Labor Party feel terribly ashamed of itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we have a situation now where, as I said, the government is trying to redress the balance. The public hospital system has for a long time been groaning at the seams. People simply have had to wait for 18 months or two years to have operations done and the proposals that the government is putting forward,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3754"> as I said, are an attempt to encourage people back into the private sector so that what have been very under-utilised private hospitals can begin to take the workload off the public hospital system. Senator Neal's comment that the utilisation of private hospitals is now at record levels is absolute nonsense. They have been at record low levels and this system will improve their utilisation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I am pleased, on behalf of the government, to move this motion in the Senate today. It is in identical terms to a motion being moved by the government in the other place. It gives parliamentarians an opportunity to reflect upon the significance of the 1967 referendum and what has been achieved since that date and also, as we put in the terms of the mo
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion, to remind us of disadvantages still experienced by Aboriginal people and to pledge ourselves in the challenge to help overcome those disadvantages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened some 30 years ago was that a referendum, sponsored by the then Holt government, granted the Commonwealth legislative power to make laws with respect to Aboriginal people. It also deleted the provisions of section 127 of the constitution which had prevented Aboriginal people from being counted in the national census. Section 51(xxvi) of the constitution originally permitted the Commonwealth parliament to make laws with respect to `the people of any race other than the Aboriginal race in any state for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws.' The words `other than the Aboriginal race in any state' were removed in 1967, thereby allowing the Commonwealth to pass specific laws relating to our indigenous people. This of course had previously been within the legislative responsibility of the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, as I said, the 1967 referendum repealed section 127 of the constitution, which read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reckoning the numbers of the people of the Commonwealth or of a state or other part of the Commonwealth, Aboriginal natives shall not be counted.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Indigenous people have of course been counted in each census since the removal of section 127. The 27th of May 1967 therefore is a very important date in the history of Australia. It was one of the major steps upon the long road of achieving true equality for indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There had of course been other significant steps, such as the granting of citizenship in 1948 and the granting of the vote in 1962, but what I guess was special about the 1967 referendum was that it was the only time that the Australian people as a whole had the opportunity to directly express their views. The fact that an overwhelming majority&mdash;as I said, some 90.77 per cent&mdash;voted for the change demonstrated the extent to which Australians as a whole realised that injustice and inequality for Aboriginal Australians had to be addressed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3755">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also an important referendum because, although it may have been led by the Liberal&hyphen;National government, it was supported by all sides of the parliament. In fact, as I understand it, there was no case put to voters. We would like to think that the 1967 referendum was symbolic of the Australian people's fair&hyphen;mindedness, tolerance and goodwill to build a shared future for all Australians within our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also a clear acknowledgment that national governments had significant responsibilities towards Aboriginal people in addition to the responsibilities that had been accepted by the states. It recognised, we believed, that there was a need to address the profound economic and social disadvantages suffered by indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the following 30 years, there have been many changes and many attempts by this parliament and other parliaments to address those disadvantages and injustices. Whereas there is obviously room to debate the effectiveness of those attempts&mdash;and there has not always been cross&hyphen;party support for the details of the reforms that have been instituted&mdash;nevertheless I think it is fair to say that there has been unanimity in the view that efforts should be made to overcome the injustices of the past and to move towards true equality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could look at reforms such as the establishment of the Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the development of a dedicated legal and health service for Aboriginal people, the establishment of a federal portfolio devoted to indigenous Australians, the development of the community employment development program, the community housing and infrastructure program for indigenous peoples, the community infrastructure priority projects scheme, the further development of Aboriginal health services and national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy. And we could continue. We could speak of the purpose and goals of the establishment of ATSIC, all leading to an attempt to find reconciliation through the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation which was established in 1991. Most of those more recent initiatives were initiatives of Labor governments in this place, but if I go back a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> little further we will recollect the decision of the Fraser government in 1976 to grant land rights to Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of this, we have legislation protecting Aboriginal heritage sites. It can and will be further improved. In question time today Senator Alston drew attention to the role that has been played in the protection and promotion of indigenous art and culture and the benefits that can flow to Aboriginal people from a wider acknowledgment and appreciation of those arts and culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We come up to more contemporary times through this experience, recognising what has been achieved and also what has not yet been achieved, to the process of reconciliation which, I guess, in many ways, is an attempt to address the spiritual differences of the past and to draw Australians closer together, to recognise history and the consequences of history, but to particularly look forward and to recognise, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said yesterday in Melbourne, that a vital part of reconciliation must be working together `to raise the living standards and broaden opportunities available to the most disadvantaged group in Australian society' of the Australian indigenous people. That is why, obviously, we strongly support the reconciliation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent times we have had to address the challenges presented by the High Court in its Mabo judgment. Even then, I think that all parties in this place accept native title. There have been differences in how you provide an administrative framework for it but all parties have accepted in good spirit the right to  native title. We have seen the parliament in this place wrestle with the tragedy of deaths in custody and I think we still, unfortunately, have not found the full and adequate answers to that situation. Now the latest chapter, as we move down this path of reconciliation, is to provide an appropriate response to the report on separation of children, a report which has been acknowledged by the coalition government to recognise a regrettable part of Australia's history, certainly not a part that was recognised at the time to be regrettable.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3756">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, generally the policies of that time were pursued in a way that they believed was to the benefit of Aboriginal children. Now, of course, with the benefit of hindsight we realise that in many ways they were very cruel policies that took from these children their identity, their family, their culture and their traditions. Having learnt from the experiences of the past, our challenge is now to find an appropriate way in which to address that recognition as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a difficult path. We do not underestimate the challenges that still lie ahead, but we do take this opportunity to commit ourselves to achieving justice for indigenous people to overcome the disadvantages they have suffered in the past and still continue to suffer, to overcome disadvantages in the areas of health, education, housing and particularly job opportunities, and in particular to encourage respect for indigenous people, their traditions, culture and their most important place within our broader community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The 1967 referendum has profound symbolic and practical significance for all Australians. The referendum changed section 127 to allow Aborigines to be counted in the census and thus recognised their humanity and the oneness of the Australian people. Amendment to section 51(xxvi) gave the Commonwealth the head of power to pass legislation and expend funds for the benefit of Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1967 referendum is a key signpost in our nation's journey to unity and reconciliation for all Australian people. It is a journey that has taken many turns, some of them backwards. South Australian women and Aborigines had the right to vote before Federation but the Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902, whilst extending the right to vote to women for federal elections, explicitly disenfranchised Aborigines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a similar vein, the Invalid and Old Age Pensions Act 1908 disqualified Aborigines from receiving the pension. This racism by omission and commission occurred against a background of state government policies of assimilation that ignored and devalued Aboriginal culture, shattered Aboriginal families and communities, and continued the dispos session and alienation of Aboriginal people from their land. The fact that we joined other democracies in 1939 to fight against forces committed to notions of racial superiority and to active policies of genocide appears to have made little immediate connection to the conduct of domestic policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Isolated but articulate voices began to be heard in this Commonwealth parliament. In 1950, moved by appalling circumstances of both remote Aboriginal communities and fringe dwellers, Paul Hasluck called for federal intervention in both policy and funding in Aboriginal affairs. He even succeeded
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3757"> in having a motion unanimously supported in the House of Representatives, but official government policy remained inert.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minerals boom from the 1950s and through the 1960s and 1970s saw increasing pressure on Aboriginal communities where the people had been until then able to pursue a traditional lifestyle. The impact of the miners was largely unwelcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1957 Gordon Bryant used the evidence of the negative impact of minerals development to propose to the parliament that `power to control native affairs should reside in this parliament'. Gough Whitlam and Kim Beazley Snr called for a wider Commonwealth role. In 1963 they were parties to presenting to the government the petition of the Yolngu people of Yirrkala protesting against mining leases in Arnhem Land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Australian developments were not occurring in isolation. Anti-racist, anti-colonialist sentiments found voice across the world, in freedom marches in the United States, in the resolutions of the United Nations and in the emerging widespread criticism of apartheid in South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coming of the television age and the greater mobility of Australian people saw their knowledge and experience of the real circumstances of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people greatly enhanced. I think the ABC in general and their current affairs programs such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">This Day Tonight</EMPHASIS> played an honourable and significant role in raising public awareness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders campaigned throughout the 1960s across a broad front for justice and equity for indigenous peoples, and was at the forefront of the campaign that ultimately brought us the 1967 referendum. Its activities were mirrored by state&hyphen;based equivalent organisations and it was supported by religious groups such as the Society of Friends, which rejected the older paternalistic models in working with indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The television and other media exposed Australians to positive images of black leader
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ship. Heroes in other places, such as Martin Luther King Junior and Nelson Mandela, had their Australian counterparts in people such as Faith Bandler. When the freedom rides of America's deep south were emulated in Australia, we saw the emergence of Charles Perkins. In the same year, Billy Wentworth, Gordon Bryant and Kim Beazley Senior sought to amend government proposals for constitutional amendment by including a new section 51(xxvi) proscribing racial discrimination. The bill was passed, but lapsed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was these worthy campaigners, together with Gough Whitlam, who were at the forefront of the renewed efforts in the parliament in 1967. State leaders such as Don Dunstan ran vigorous yes campaigns. There was no doubt in the minds of the campaigners that the amendment to section 51 was enacted to enable the betterment of indigenous people. An editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of the day remarked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has been given a firm directive to go far beyond its past efforts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The then Deputy Leader of the Country Party, Doug Anthony, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would give the Commonwealth, for the first time, power to  make special laws for the benefit of Aboriginal people throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Real Commonwealth initiatives in response to the new constitutional power dated from 1972. Legislation such as the Aboriginal Loans Commission Act 1974, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, and all subsequent exercises of the power,  have had a common factor. They were all for the betterment of indigenous people. There has never been a suggestion that the power could be the basis for undermining or diminishing the common law or statutory rights of Aborigines or Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Racial Discrimination Act 1975, introduced by the Whitlam government and supported by the Fraser&hyphen;Anthony opposition, married the new power with the existing external affairs power to give force to our international treaty obligations to address racial discrimination. The thrust of initiatives from 1967 onwards has been for the improve
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3758"> ment of the health, education and general wellbeing of indigenous people. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 was the culmination of a move away from paternalism and welfare mentality towards greater empowerment and self&hyphen;determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Native Title Act 1993 enables indigenous people to access an alternative and less adversarial means of proving title on lands where native title has yet to be extinguished by later grants or land use in the post&hyphen;colonial era. It would be a travesty and a tragedy if the government were to use a constitutional power enacted for the betterment of indigenous people to attempt to amend the act in a way that seeks to wind back their existing statutory or common law rights. We believe that it would not only be wrong, but ultimately would be shown to be illegal, albeit after costly and socially divisive litigation and public outcry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Commonwealth action following the 1967 referendum has seen significant advances in education for indigenous people. The influence and achievement of indigenous leaders today is testimony to the advances in participation in secondary and further education. Increasing representation of indigenous people across the professions&mdash;in academia, the arts and public administration&mdash;is the cause of community pride.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is still much to be achieved in indigenous health, in reducing imprisonment rates, in addressing Aboriginal deaths in custody and in healing the personal and social wounds that are the legacy of generations of neglect and active dispossession. Just as surely as the referendum was an event of significance, so is the release this week of the report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families. This is a matter that will be dealt with later this week in the Senate, but it is appropriate to reflect on it in the context of the motion that is before the Senate today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The significance of the report will be amplified and will be defined by the way in which the government and the parliament
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> respond to it. If we fail to apologise for the pain, suffering and social dislocation documented in the report, and if we fail to respond with ample compensation and restitution to the survivors and their families, we will have lost an historic opportunity and we will have gravely damaged the cause of reconciliation. We cannot rewrite history but we can shape the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1967 referendum conferred on the Commonwealth a specific responsibility. A part of that responsibility is to protect our minorities. The nature of parliamentary democracy is such that the majority obviously will determine the government of the day. It is for that government to protect the culture, the beliefs and the wellbeing of minorities who could be sidelined in the process. Reconciliation for all Australians requires us to respect the rights of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the amendment I have moved to the government's motion. It is the same as an amendment that will be moved in the House of Representatives by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley. We must not put at risk the real progress that we have made since 1967.

In her place, I speak on behalf of the Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing I want to say is that it gives me no pleasure to discover that a motion which has been moved by the opposition has, at this late stage, been amended by the government, and the government's amendments propose something much weaker than what was proposed by the opposition&mdash;which the Democrats certainly support. So I want to support the amendment moved by Senator Faulkner which put the critical words back in this motion.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3759">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not want this kind of shallow tipping of the hat. I do not know what words to use, because I am fairly angry that this government did not itself propose any motion until the opposition shamed it into proposing something. Then it tried to water down and weaken absolutely what the opposition had proposed. It seems to me that, if the government&mdash;in the spirit of reconciliation&mdash;wanted to support the kind of motion the opposition was moving, it would have done so in a spirit of cooperation rather than trying to destroy the original motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No matter what words the government proposes, there are some critical phrases in its proposal which to me are a denial of what we ought to be doing here today. Let me point out a couple of these things. What the government is trying to do is to support the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who in his speech yesterday tried to drive a wedge between what he calls practical measures&mdash;which he supports&mdash;and mere symbolism. I want to say to the Prime Minister that there is no choice between symbolism and practical measures. Both are important and, if we are really fair dinkum about reconciliation and about acknowledging our own history&mdash;not just 200 years of history but our own history of yesterday, last month, last year and this year&mdash;both must be put in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no reconciliation without justice, and symbolism is as important as practical measures. The referendum in 1967 gave the Commonwealth government the power to make laws for the benefit of Aboriginals and Islanders. It was at that point in history that the recognition was made that state governments had failed miserably to deliver justice and that, finally, the Commonwealth government would have to step in and make those laws on behalf of us all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relationships, symbolism is sometimes even more important than practical measures&mdash;or at least ought to precede the practical measures. In relationships between individual people and between groups of people, it is important to say sorry for the wrongs not just of the distant past but of the immediate past, so that forgiveness can be offered and reconciliation can then take place and be
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> followed by the practical measures which all of us agree are absolutely fundamental and important. But it is no use the government trying to say, `We will take practical measures', and then in a mealy&hyphen;mouthed way saying that the symbolism of apologies and the rest is not important. It is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other part of the government's proposal which makes me very angry is the change from placing the plaque in the new Parliament House to putting it into a backroom in the old Parliament House. This is symbolic of what this government has tried to do with this issue all along. It keeps on saying, `This is a matter of history. We cannot take the blame for what happened 200 years ago.'  We cannot, but we can take the blame for what we ourselves have done and for what our parliaments have done in the last 30 years. In my own  lifetime&mdash;and the lifetime of most people in this place&mdash;I am aware of appalling behaviour on the part of parliaments of various political colours in Queensland. We may not be personally responsible for what happened 200 years ago, but we are responsible for our own generation and for what we allowed to happen yesterday, the day before, the month before that and last year. We are responsible for what happens this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats reject utterly the attempt by the government to water down this motion. We certainly support what the opposition is doing in seeking to restore the words which have been omitted. I hope the government in its shame will reconsider what it is trying to do and will support the original motion and the amendments to make that original motion the motion before the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, 27 May, is the 30th anniversary of the 1967 referendum that amended the Australian constitution and gave recognition to the indigenous people of Australia&mdash;the first Australians. I cannot for the life of me understand why it took until 1967. It was well within my time: I can remember the day; I can even remember going down to vote. It was a significant advancement for Australia, and one that came far too late. When Australians were given the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3760"> opportunity to recognise the indigenous people&mdash;the first Australians&mdash;an overwhelming majority of 90 per cent or 93 per cent, or whatever it was, took the opportunity to recognise Australian Aboriginals and have them recognised under the federal constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, if a referendum was put forward today, it would be carried by an even greater majority. I do not think there is any fair&hyphen;minded Australian who would not wish to see all indigenous people have this recognition under the Australian constitution. I also recognise that there would be very few Australians who would not want indigenous people to have equal access to good health facilities, education and other opportunities. All Australians would want equal opportunities for Aboriginals to advance their quality of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got to give a hand up to all sorts of people when they are disadvantaged, whether they be Aboriginals, people who are in droughts or people affected by low commodity prices. Despite the Hanson rhetoric, which is only a vocal minority, there really exists in all Australians a heartfelt belief for a fair go for everyone and an intense dislike of racism. This would culminate in support for a similar referendum, which would be as overwhelming today as it was in 1967.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has made great steps forward since 1967. We have seen Aboriginal and Islander leaders proudly and effectively representing and speaking for their communities through their elected bodies. There are achievements in all walks of life&mdash;in law, medicine. I know one Islander who recently became a doctor. There have been magnificent achievements in the arts, reflecting the beauty and pride felt in indigenous culture. There has also been widespread international recognition of indigenous arts and crafts, music and dance. There has been international recognition of these great gifts and they have attracted and promoted tourism to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, through education and understanding, there exists widespread awareness and recognition within the community of the great wealth and history of indigenous people.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian people are rightly focusing on the existing health, education, housing and sanitation facilities that are still badly needed in some communities and are concentrating on the programs required to address these problems. I recognise Senator Woodley's commitment to the Aboriginal community and his impassioned speech a few minutes ago. But I do think we have got to put our best efforts where they are required the most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been fortunate. I have travelled throughout Queensland and other states, and I have been honoured to share the indigenous culture of the Aboriginals and Islander people from the Torres Strait and to see the advancement over the years in Queensland where there has been a deed of grant, where millions and millions of acres of land&mdash;I think it is 200 million acres or something of that nature&mdash;were given as a deed of grant to indigenous communities. It is not just wasteland. It is beautiful coastal productive land up and down the Gulf of Carpentaria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regret in recent months that the Wik debate has created division and rancour that was not there in the immediate past. There was a good working relationship&mdash;probably the only working relationship in Australia&mdash;where indigenous people and pastoralists worked together and recognised each other's abilities. Race relations have regressed and have been put back as a result of the High Court decision on Wik, and Noel Pearson&mdash;whom I admire as a leader of his community&mdash;and I are now on opposite sides of a debate. We are both standing up for different principles, and that should not make enemies out of us&mdash;or enemies out of the graziers or the Aboriginals in rural communities. What  we should be trying to achieve is a better relationship between Australians and Aboriginals. I hope that this Wik debate disappears into the ether in the future and it all goes back to the way it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge the injustices done by past policies that were blatantly wrong. These were policies that were made in a different time and in different circumstances&mdash;in earlier times where the ethos was totally different from that we have now. Injustices were done resulting in longstanding hurt and deprivation.</PARA>

If we could wind the clock back I am sure that they would never happen again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The focus now must be on the future and letting indigenous people look after their own affairs. I have had a little to do with indigenous people. I certainly do not proclaim that I am an expert, but if you have indigenous people in communities who are prepared to go out and do their own thing I would plead that they be allowed to&mdash;not that white advisers be allowed in there. I am not being derogatory about the intentions of white advisers but I think it is time that these people were allowed to make their own way in life. If they make mistakes, they will correct them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to support the amendments moved by Senator Faulkner. In doing so I speak with a combination of anger and sorrow. I feel the injustice of a continuation of government policy. I feel the frustration of a process which does not treat indigenous Australians with respect. I feel anger and sorrow because I can see rights long fought for being taken away or there being an attempt to take them away. I feel anger and sorrow about a Prime Minister and government who refuse to embrace indigenous Australians as equals and who do not understand the importance of doing so. I feel this because I can see that Australia is being subjected to divisive debate. I feel this anger and sorrow because Australian society is worse off because of a lack of leadership on the part of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> And I feel it because many Australians are being vilified for no other reason than the colour of their skin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a major difference between the opposition's motion&mdash;the one I gave notice of yesterday and which was moved today by Senator Faulkner&mdash;and that of the government. For us, this is a historic opportunity to embrace the principles and the spirit of the 1967 referendum, and to recognise its historic importance and its relevance to Australians now&mdash;to our cohesiveness, to our identity, to our sense of self&hyphen;dignity, to our image in the world and to our role in the world. It is a chance for this Senate to lay down the boundaries for the future by embracing an important aspect of the past. It is a chance to say, `Yes, we have moved on. We are on the road to implementing the impact and the spirit of the referendum. We are in the business of discharging our responsibilities and we will continue to pursue the principles of that referendum.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That referendum was all about one thing: the dignity of human beings. It was about respect for religion, for culture and for equality. It goes to the heart of what civilisation is about&mdash;the question of human dignity. It was important in both effect and symbolism. It was a belated embrace by non&hyphen;indigenous Australians of indigenes as equals. They were not recognised at constitutional conventions. In fact, only one New Zealander spoke of indigenous Australians in those conventions some 100 years ago. To the effect that they were recognised in the constitution, they were recognised in two negative concepts: section 51(xxvi) excluded the Aboriginal race from Commonwealth legislative power to make  laws with respect to the people of any race and section 127 ensured that Aboriginals were not included as people for electoral purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Governor&hyphen;General today, speaking in Melbourne, made the telling and relevant point about what happened at those constitutional conventions. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not surprisingly, the section&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">he was talking about section 127&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3762">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">came increasingly to be seen as a constitutional declaration of the essential worthlessness and irrelevance of Australia's indigenous peoples. 1967 was all about redressing that.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The referendum played an important role then and it laid the foundation for much of the future. Reconciliation and the question of separation of families, native title and all those concepts flow from the responsibility of the federal government to act in the interests of indigenous Australians. It should continue to play a redemptive role for the past racism that we had to purge then and that we continue to have to purge now in the context of current debates. It was a referendum which laid the foundations, the ground rules, for the future and the benchmark for future action&mdash;action which was quite well reinforced in 1975 by the implementation of the Racial Discrimination Act by the Whitlam government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those foundations are still being tested in this place as we grapple with not just the issues of the welfare of Aboriginal Australians but also the fundamental issues of their right to the land and questions relating to the Wik decision and native title. They got rights in 1967 but, more importantly, symbolically and powerfully, they got a right to be treated as equals. What that referendum said to the Australian parliament was that those rights needed to be delivered upon. We are talking about more than physical rights. It was an expectation and an entitlement to be treated with dignity as human beings&mdash;the concept of respect for spirituality and culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In yesterday's Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, Galarrwuy Yunupingu made it clear that the rights Aboriginal Australians want and deserve are more than just the tangible physical rights this government wants to focus on. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without our rights to land, we will be like a dry leaf dropped from a tree, floating down the river with no direction, no home and no future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard wants to cut us off from our roots and leave us like parasites around the edges of the cities and towns of Australia, living on compensation payments, grieving for our land.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Native title is not a piece of paper or words in a book. It is our living Aboriginal culture. It is our songs and our dances, painted on our bodies and written in the sand.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And further:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our children should be able to grow up equal, as mates, in a fair country. Killing off our law and culture will make this impossible.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So it is important for us to recognise more than what this government wants to recognise. It is important for us to recognise that equality means recognition of the spirit as well as the body. As Governor-General Deane said today, we have to address the problems of the spirit as well as those of the body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That referendum did not just happen. It built up over a number of years. A whole body of people were involved in it, from Aboriginal Australians to hundreds of thousands of non-Aboriginal Australians. There were the freedom fighters of the 1960s. Vincent Lingiari led a walk off for 10 years of the Gurindji workers of Wave Hill in 1966. There was a coalition of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians in 1967 involving a whole raft of people, including the political leaders. I am glad to say that the leadership from our side of politics came from Gough Whitlam, Don Dunstan and Kim Beazley Snr. But that leadership did not just come from our side&mdash;and I will go to that in a few moments&mdash;because Prime Minister Holt and the then Deputy Leader of the Country Party, Doug Anthony, were also instrumental at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Labor Party is asking the Senate to do today is to live up to the standards of that referendum. But, unfortunately, this government cannot bring itself up to the barrier, and it is for that reason that we have moved our amendment. We see the government's motion as being weasel words of little impact and no effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sorry to say that, in moving what they have moved today&mdash;in being pushed into it by the Labor Party and now of course by the rest of the Senate&mdash;they have once again failed Australia. We have tried to negotiate. We were met with insensitivity. We were met with stubbornness. We were met with the normal response from the Prime Minister&mdash;
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3763">that is, `Oh, that is politically correct. I won't have a bar of it.' Equal rights is more than political correctness. As I said, it goes to the heart of civilisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have problems with the government's motion. First of all, it condones an abuse of the race power. Our motions&mdash;the one I moved yesterday and the amendment moved today by Senator Faulkner&mdash;make it very clear in clause (3) and clause (6) that we expect this parliament to live up to the letter and the spirit of the referendum. That is, the race power as amended in 1967 can only be used for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I stress that: it is for their benefit. As we say in clause (6), the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . calls upon all Australian governments and Parliaments, and all Australians, to respect and honour both the letter and spirit of the 1967 referendum&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The question is this: can you use the power entrusted to the parliament in 1967 to act in a way discriminatory against Aboriginal Australians? We say you cannot. The whole reason the constitution was changed then was to empower the government to overcome some of the problems of discrimination against indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By attempting to delete that, the government gives a very clear signal. That signal is that they are prepared to attempt to use this power to discriminate against Aboriginal Australians. It is an abuse of the power entrusted to us and, for that reason, we are proceeding with clauses (3) and (6) of our amendment. We have to live up to the letter of that referendum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have to live up to the promises and commitments made on all sides of parliament. Prime Minister Harold Holt said at the time in supporting the referendum:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot allow it to be said that our constitution discriminates against some people who live within our shores&mdash;the Aborigines. Nor is it, we believe, acceptable to the Australian people that the national parliament should not have the power to make special laws for the people of the Aboriginal race where that is in their best interests.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Doug Anthony, the Deputy Leader of the Country Party, said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . words which can be read as discriminating against the Aboriginal race will be removed. This would give the Commonwealth, for the first time, power to make special laws for the benefit of Aboriginal people throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Gough Whitlam, the Leader of the Labor Party, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The welfare of Australian Aboriginals requires this referendum be carried. The good name of Australia demands it be carried overwhelmingly. The Commonwealth must now be empowered to accept that responsibility on behalf of Aboriginals, as it already does for all other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There was no question at the time of what the leadership was on about. It was changing the constitution to empower the government to overcome the problems of indigenous Australians and to act in their interest. If anyone had any doubt, Governor-General Deane once again today made it clear when talking about the pre&hyphen;existing 1967 situation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That meant that, while the exclusion remained, the Commonwealth lacked legislative power to make any law designed for the special benefit of the Aboriginal people in any of the states. In contrast, once the exclusion was deleted, the Commonwealth, under section 51(xxxvi), possessed plenary legislative power to make any special laws which it deemed necessary for the welfare of the Aboriginal peoples.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Why is the government running away from such an explicit understanding of what is in the referendum? They know they cannot use the foreign affairs power to take away Aboriginal rights to title. They are signalling here that they want to use the race power and they want to rewrite history to do so&mdash;for instance, in the immediate future with their 10&hyphen;point plan. They want the right to introduce and pass legislation which discriminates against Aboriginal Australians. Would you believe it? On the 30th anniversary of this referendum, they want the power to be able to introduce racist legislation, and we will not have a bar of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the second part of our concern, I will digress for a moment and go to clause (7). We feel it is relevant now to continue to commemorate the 1967 referendum and to have the plaque which was unveiled today by the Governor&hyphen;General and Dr Faith Bandler properly housed within this parliament.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3764">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The referendum is of relevance now. It is not a past event of no relevance and with no impact on our future. That referendum should guide us by its presence, and we should not consign it to a rickety old museum. We need to treat Aboriginal rights as equal and we should not put it in Old Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nothing could better symbolise this government's attitude. They are saying, `Yes, we acknowledged your existence in 1967, but we are not going to acknowledge your place in the modern nation as we move into the next millennium.' They are saying, `Rather than having a place in the living heart of our democracy, your referendum can sit in a museum like the skeletal remains of some long dead ancestor.' We will not have a bar of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite amazing that the government wants to change the motion we moved yesterday to remove the reference to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . health, housing, education, employment and related measures, but also through measures to redress, to the extent now possible, the deprivation of life, liberty, property and dignity which indigenous people have suffered through so much of Australia's history;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They cannot deny it happened. Why do they want to write it out of history now? They also want to remove the words from our motion that says that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . recognises the critical importance to indigenous Australians and the wider Australian community of a continuing reconciliation process&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">God, you reckon we need it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">based on understanding of and frank apologies for what has gone wrong in the past, and total commitment to equal respect in the future;</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is not hard to say sorry, and it is something that we should be saying in this place. The reconciliation process needs to continue and it needs to be embodied here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to ask yourself of the Prime Minister: why can he not do the decent thing? Why can he not apologise? Why can he not respond to the public opinion polls this time? Sixty-five per cent of Australians say that we need to have an official acknowledgment and apology for the separation of Aboriginal children. He did respond to those polls in every other instance but he cannot bring himself around to do it in power.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why can the Prime Minister not call the dark spots in our history for what they are? Why does he always have to divert to some general parenthood words about our history? We have had some dark spots. Why does he not condemn them as leader of this nation? Why can he not agree with Holt and Anthony? Why does he repudiate the Liberal Party history? When you look at them all&mdash;Holt, Anthony, Hewson, Fraser and McMahon&mdash;this bloke is not the most conservative Liberal Party leader in history, as he claims to be; but he is the most prejudiced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the few minutes left to me I want say a few words about the people who have been running a very strong leadership role in opposition to this Prime Minister and his lack of leadership. These people are concerned that we do not fall into the trap of entrenching division, suspicion and hatred based on race, as I think the direct impact of the government's policies are bringing about. I refer to the black leaders. They are not the sources of the problem; in fact, I know from the contact I have had with them that they are sincere, intelligent and committed, and they show leadership and they are prepared to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I saw Pat Dodson on TV last night. I must say that he epitomised what modern black leadership is about. He was restrained and he handled the chairing of the reconciliation process extremely well. He is a measured man. His words yesterday&mdash;he said that if we cannot achieve coexistence, we cannot achieve reconciliation&mdash;were words that the government should listen too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that Mick Dodson feels Australian from time to time. He is an intelligent and powerful man. Lois O'Donoghue is a person who was separated from her mother. If anyone really wants to hear about the impact of separation, have a talk to Lois some day. There are more, including Noel Pearson. I will just mention the ones that I have had contact with. They include Tracker Tilmouth, Marcia Langton, Galarrwuy and Mandawuy Yunupingu, Peter Yu, Charlie Perkins, Sugar Ray Robinson and now Gatjil Djerrkura. I am sure I have missed a lot out. They are people who have actually shown a lot of leadership,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3765"> are measured in their approach and are quite scientific and forensic in their assessment of issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I also wish to say something about Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner Wilson, with whom I have had tussles from time to time in government. He made the telling point yesterday that truth is the only foundation for reconciliation. The work that he has done in recent years, particularly on this issue and on others, is something that needs to be recognised in this parliament. The fact that he was subjected to government besmirching and attacking his reputation because of this separation report is something that I think no government should be proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, this is not an issue that will go away. Until we reconcile with our indigenous Australians, we will not be comfortable and relaxed. Until we live with, enjoy and cherish our diversity, we will not have matured as a nation. Until we coexist properly, earnestly and frankly, we will not be able to walk together into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not too late to call on the government now, and to call on Senator Hill in particular, to do the decent thing. Your Prime Minister is wrong. The Prime Minister lives under his shield of prejudice. The Prime Minister is proud of the fact that he is more conservative than every other Liberal Party leader in history. He is wrong. I think it is important for senators here on the other side to tell him so and to embrace the opposition's motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess the instructions perhaps should have been revised to look at some justice and representation, which is perhaps the very thing we are talking about here. Aboriginal people have been allowed to exist for only 30 years and, even so, only partially. Terra nullius still existed in white Australian law for another 25 years. So they existed from that point but they did not exist before that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not under any circumstances pat ourselves on the back in the belief that some justice or rights had been given as a result of that decision 30 years ago. Yes, it was a step in the right direction but today we are still seeing words that are very infrequently matched by action&mdash;words from the opposition, which in recent times voted for the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill. In the last few weeks it was prepared to let electoral expediency overrule the right of people to be heard in respect of justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard from Senator Boswell that race relations have been put back as a result of the High Court decision on Wik. No, race relations were not put back as a result of the High Court decision on Wik. Race relations were put back because people believed and still believe that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be seen. They may be allowed to be seen&mdash;perhaps not everywhere&mdash;but not heard. When Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people seek to be heard, then that is considered to be inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have had a call for silence. We continue to have people told, `If only you didn't say that', `If only you didn't do that,' `If only black activists didn't open their mouths.' We still have in our country an overwhelming paternalism, and paternalism does equal racism. We heard the words from the late Prime Minister Holt, `laws in their best interests.' Yes, the system was set up with a sense of paternalism and it has con tinued that way. We still have a situation whereby it was considered, when the Native Title Bill was passed, that this parliament gave rights to Aboriginal people. No, this parliament did not. Those rights exist. Those rights have always existed. However, the High
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3766"> Court very belatedly recognised those rights, but only a little bit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This parliament, if anything, took away some of those rights and reassured other people of their rights. The decision in relation to Wik was considered to be a concern because for some reason there might be a recognition that Aboriginal people still existed on pastoral land&mdash;still existed or were allowed to exist, or were allowed to have some basis for existing on pastoral land. What do people expect them to do? They cannot go away. They cannot repudiate their connections to the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within these statements we see the word `disadvantages'&mdash;for that read `discrimination.' If we do not see that word as `discrimination', we will continue to see the parliament and white society as being the paternalistic giver of benefits, not as the people who will eventually allow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to make decisions for themselves. Is this so scary, that people will have rights of self&hyphen;determination?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The perceptions of the Native Title Act were widely advertised. Many people felt that justice was being delivered. Many other people knew it was not. Having run by that false perception, which I have to say the then government inspired, it was then easy to assume that something was given and therefore something could be taken away. The reality is that nothing was given. However, that is not stopping this current government from wanting to take something more away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proves without any doubt in my mind the fragility of the concept of social justice within our current parliamentary system. It proves to me that Australia cannot pretend to be a just society until, within our constitution, there are words that guarantee the basic rights of citizens and, in particular, there are words that guarantee basic human rights to our indigenous people. That is well overdue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that we cannot continue as a society to hold our head up in any international arena until we redress these issues; until we redress the wrongs not just of the past but also the wrongs of the present. We must deal
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with the false perceptions. We must not feed on the fear and uncertainty of our economic times. We must, first of all, be honest about what is causing the problems in our society, what is causing the uncertainty in our society, deal with those honestly, and not rely on the scapegoat easy way out of blaming those groups in our society who have less power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening in our society is that we are making ourselves feel better by blaming someone else. The now opposition gave the perception of giving something to Aboriginal people when in fact it was giving as much certainty as it could to all other property interests in Australia. We must be willing to see that there are people who would feed on that uncertainty in our society by attempting to even erode the few rights that exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be supporting the ALP's amendment to the government's motion, but I do not support the view that that gives the opposition the right to feel complacent and the right to feel that their words excuse them for their recent actions&mdash;not just their actions in relation to Hindmarsh but also their actions in relation to the way in which the Native Title Bill was negotiated. Many people were disenfranchised during that process. The legislation was pushed as giving rights to Aboriginal people, which it did not. This paternalistic lie has continued to be put. We will not advance until that lie is redressed and admitted. It seems that we will continue to go backwards in times of continued uncertainty until there are constitutional rights guaranteed for all Australians but, in particular, for indigenous Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

Today outside this parliament the Tibetan flags are flying alongside the representations of the Aboriginal people still seeking justice in this country.

We cannot escape that conclusion. We cannot escape the fact that in both countries the appalling circumstances that have in the past visited the indigenous people of the world, and which continue to afflict some 300 million indigenous people around the world, are being continued because their interests will be seen as getting in the way of the interests of the rich and the powerful around the world, the people who have the power as against the people who do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot pass up altogether the remarks of the Leader of the National Party (Senator Boswell) in this chamber because, while I accept the sincerity of what he had to say, there is echoing in his words what is wrong with the approach of not a few Australians, and particularly people on the right of the political spectrum in this country, in terms of their concern to allay any difficulties that may be seen in the relationship between indigenous Australians and the rest of Australia, and any obligations that may have to be met by the government of the day, of which they are part.</PARA>

The Wik decision was a very short footstep, where a long footstep is needed, towards redressing the rights of Aboriginal and indigenous people to their land, so long taken away from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I see it, the wish that everything would go back to where it was is simply a means of inherently blaming those people who are raising a controversy, as if the controversy itself ought not to exist. But, as previous speakers on this side of the parliament have said, the controversy will not go away until we address it and until we fix it, and the responsibility for that controversy is on our shoulders, not on the shoulders of the Aboriginal and indigenous Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Boswell said, `It is time now these people were allowed to make their own way in life, free of white advisers.' There is a penetrating paternalism about those words. It is as if access to advice&mdash;white, black or whatever&mdash;in this country ought to be a prerogative of those of us who have the money, the links and the power. Let us remember that we are in a system where the law is based on the protection of property and where the law is more readily accessible and usable to their advantage by the people who have the property, by the people who have the money, by the people who can afford the counsel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How dare we reflect on those people who are at the other end of the spectrum&mdash;dispossessed, their law set aside, having the option only of recourse to the law imposed on them&mdash;by saying that they should not have access to the advice that the rest of us have. I do not believe Senator Boswell means to be discriminatory in what he says. I believe he is simply reflecting the inability to empathise with the indigenous people, try as he might, that so many other Australians who are unable to grasp the need for reconciliation have, and which blights their ability to feel strongly
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3768"> about the need for this nation to grasp this problem and correct it in so far as we can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, Senator Boswell, representing the National Party, said, `Millions and millions of acres of land were given as a deed of grant to the Aboriginal people in Queensland, in the Gulf of Carpentaria region.' Again, those words give away the problem which is ours in redressing the wrongs of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can we say it was big of us to give land to people which was theirs at the outset? Are we not saying, in effect, that we are withdrawing our historically wrong assumption that the land was not theirs, that those people did not exist and that we took it under wrongful and illegal circumstances? Of course, the right seminality is that we recognised the right of the indigenous people through that deed of grant to maintain in their ownership, their rights, the land which had always been theirs and to simply recognise the pre-existing right they had before we arrived over the last couple of centuries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very difficult and trying time for this nation. The controversy seems to be at a level unprecedented in my lifetime. It is one that we all have to account ourselves in. It is one that challenges us all. But, as many people in the indigenous population of this country have made it so clear, it is one that we must address and rectify, hence the need for reconciliation in the fullest sense of that word.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mealy-mouthed and mealy&hyphen;worded motion of the government echoes all the shortcomings of the past and embraces with no success any of the challenges which will make the future the positive, all inclusive and wholesome prospect that the past has not been. I, therefore, support the opposition's amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reflecting on the words of other speakers that the symbolism is of itself important, I point to that last amendment which would have the plaque that Faith Bandler and the Governor-General revealed today in Melbourne placed in this parliament, not in the museum of Old Parliament House. I am amazed that the government does not understand the symbolism of that amendment to the original Labor proposition that that plaque should be in this parliament when it has
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> altered it to confine the plaque to the museum down the road&mdash;wrong symbolism, wrong attitude, failure to relate and empathise. We can do better than that. We must do better than that, and I hope the Senate will endorse the opposition's amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today marks the 30th anniversary of the 1967 referendum which gave the Commonwealth the power to make special laws for the people of any race, in particular Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I must say to this chamber that I was very honoured and pleased to have been part of that great movement to ensure that that referendum was passed by this parliament and was supported by the people generally. I was a member of the ACTU executive at that time and in the lead-up to the referendum bill going through the parliament. The previous Minister for Labour and National Service, Harold Holt, who subsequently, of course, became Prime Minister, was quite strongly in favour of this particular measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was, as we all know, an overwhelming vote&mdash;over 90 per cent of the Australian electorate voted in favour of the proposition. Of course, we must realise that the proposition was to enable our parliament, the Commonwealth, to make laws, as I have said, for the peace, order and good government of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been mentioned during this particular debate, Prime Minister Harold Holt in 1967 referred to the need for this power to be exercised in the best interests of the Aboriginal people. The Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party at that particular time, Doug Anthony, indicated also that this power should be exercised for the benefit of the Aboriginal people. Gough Whitlam, again, was very strong in his support for this proposition. The next year, which was 1968, he was also in support of me.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3769">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a pity really that we do not have a motion here before us to which we are able to unanimously subscribe. I am feeling quite disappointed about that. It is a bit of a shame that that sort of division should be here within this parliament when such unanimity, almost unanimity, was evident during the 1967 discussions, debate and, of course, referendum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was sorry to hear some political point scoring during the debate, because I do not think that the difference between the government's proposal and the opposition's amendments amount to that much. I do not agree with what Senator Brown said, that the government's proposal is mealy-mouthed and mealy-worded. I do not think that we should really reflect on the motives of other members of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do indicate to the government that it ought to have another look at the amendments that have been put forward by the opposition, because I really feel that they could quite comfortably live with those amendments. The only thing that I can see in those amendments that might possibly give some concern perhaps to the government at least is in the new paragraph (5), if it is adopted, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">recognises the critical importance to indigenous Australians and the wider Australian community of a continuing reconciliation process&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think the government agrees with that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">based on understanding of and frank apologies for what has gone wrong in the past, and total commitment to equal respect in the future;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am not going to prejudge this idea of an official apology by the government until the report is tabled and one has a good look at it. The Prime Minister himself, as I understand it, made an apology in a personal sense on his own behalf, and presumably others, to the Reconciliation Convention in Melbourne yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing that is in the amendments which the government might find possible difficulty with&mdash;I do not know&mdash;relates to whether or not the commemorative plaque should be housed within new Parliament House or Old Parliament House. I really cannot understand what all the fuss is about. I do indicate that I will be supporting the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amendment. I also indicate that there are people who are making contributions to this particular matter, on the anniversary of this referendum, which will be far more eloquent than mine. I refer of course to Sir William Deane.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have only just been handed a copy of Sir William Deane's address to the Reconciliation Convention in Melbourne today. I believe that what I should do right now is to desist from saying anything further in this chamber and read what Sir William Deane has said about that marvellous victory for commonsense and indeed marvellous victory for truth and morality in this country in 1967.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do think that it is a matter of regret that the Labor Party have thought that this is the occasion for a bit of partisan politics and that Senator Bolkus thought that it was an appropriate time to be attacking the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that, if ever there was an occasion when parliamentarians across party lines might come together to express a commitment to help redress the wrongs of the past, to overcome the disadvantages that Aboriginal people still face and to work towards achieving justice for Aboriginal people, today was the day. But Senator Bolkus obviously feels that there are some votes to be won in this issue somewhere and simply could not resist the temptation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate, Senator Harradine, that it was not possible to agree on a set of words across the chamber. Attempts were made during the course of the day to do so. It was the view of the government, and remains the view of the government, that the wording that we have provided in the terms of this motion does appropriately cover all of the issues that are before us today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first is to recognise the importance of this occasion as the 30th anniversary of the referendum; to recognise even further the symbolism of over 90 per cent of the Australian community voting in support of the referendum and what that indicates in terms  of the wish of the Australian people&mdash;that the Commonwealth government play a positive
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3770"> role to the benefit of the Aboriginal people of Australia; to recognise in fact that the Commonwealth has sought to address the profound economic and social disadvantage but that we have not yet succeeded and that there is more to be done; to specifically state a commitment to the reconciliation process as an effort to address past injustices, but as part of a cooperative effort to build a better future for all Australians; and to support the request that the plaque be symbolically placed in the Old Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wording apparently was unsatisfactory from the perspective of the Labor Party and I think really the issue of consequence to the Labor Party was their first amendment, and that is in their proposed alternative paragraph (3) which I will come to in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were two other matters which Senator Harradine identified as he sought to interpret the differences between the parties. The third was in fact the issue as to whether the plaque ought to be in the Old Parliament House or the new Parliament House. I notice we both claim that we are supporting a request. I cannot see that the request can be to the same place, so there is obviously some difference of understanding there and I would have thought that that could be easily resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second was the issue of apology, which really goes to the debate that is still to come on the issue of the separation of children. As Senator Harradine acknowledged, the Prime Minister was clear in his position on that issue yesterday when he said at the reconciliation conference in Melbourne:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, there were injustices done and no&hyphen;one should obscure or minimise them. We need to acknowledge as a nation what European settlement has meant for the first Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and in particular the assault on their traditions and the discrimination and violence which they endured over many decades.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me make this clear. Personally, I feel deep sorrow for those of my fellow Australians who have suffered injustices under the practices of past generations towards indigenous people. Equally, I am sorry for the hurt and trauma many people here today may continue to feel as a consequence of those practices.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And later:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must acknowledge past wrongs, understand that they still cause a great deal of personal distress and resolve to improve areas of indigenous disadvantage, both now and in the future.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would have thought that the position of the Prime Minister, as he stated publicly yesterday, is absolutely clear. We recognise mistakes have been made in the past. It is much easier, years after, to recognise that fact but, nevertheless, with the benefit of hindsight we recognise it and we recognise a responsibility to do something about it and work to overcome injustice and disadvantage. I really do not think that is the issue that has caused division on this matter. The issue that has caused division was the first one I mentioned, that is, the determination of the Labor Party to include within this motion today the words that the power conferred by the referendum would `only be used for the benefit of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the referendum was passed for the benefit of the Aboriginal people and that is what over 90 per cent of Australians voted for. But what is now being said by the Labor Party, really in an attempt to attack our efforts to address the Wik judgment in terms of legislation in this place, is that it should be necessary to prove that each and every specific law is for the benefit of the Aboriginal people. That is not as it has been interpreted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why not?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because&mdash;if I might respond to the interjection,  Mr Acting Deputy President&mdash;it is a simplistic approach. On that basis the High Court may well have struck down the Native Title Act. The Native Title Act of the Labor Party was an attempt to address, in terms of public administration, the Mabo judgment, in the same way that we have a responsibility to address, in terms of public administration, the Wik judgment. But to give the narrow interpretation now being sought to be applied by the Labor Party for its partisan political purposes to our efforts to address Wik, which they were not prepared to accept in addressing Mabo, is inappropriate.  The important thing is that the law as a whole, the power to legislate provided by the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3771"> change to the constitution, was for the benefit of the Aboriginal people. And so it should be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interpretation that the Labor Party now seeks to adopt, which is inconsistent with the interpretation that has been applied by the majority of the High Court, is simply being applied in this effort for partisan political purposes and that is the only real reason that the Labor Party was determined to have this amendment&mdash;so that they could then attack the coalition's legislative response. That, I guess, is the consequence of changing sides in this chamber, Senator Bolkus. When this chamber addressed the native title legislation, it was different from what it is going to be when you have to address the legislation of this government that will flow from the Wik judgment, in our attempt to try to find a workable balance in administrative terms out of that judgment. We are not going to allow you to interpret this amendment in a way that suits your purposes by having us vote for it, and therefore we have no alternative but to vote against it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, unfortunately the Labor Party was determined from the start to introduce a note of partisan politics into this debate. They have succeeded in doing that, so they will not get an unanimous outcome today and I think history will record that as a disappointment from today's effort, but so it must be. It is certainly not the preference of the Australian government. It is unfortunately the determination of the Australian Labor Party that still regrettably sees a vote or two in this issue.</PARA>

<PETITION PAGE="3772" TOTAL.SIGNED="66" PRESENTERS="Calvert, Sen Paul" NAMEIDS="5F4"><TITLE>Repatriation Benefits</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable `active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator Calvert</NAME><FROM>(from 66 citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">LIFE INSURANCE ACT 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REGULATION 10.05B</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter dated 20 February 1997, concerning privacy issues relating to Regulation 10.05B under the Life Insurance Act 1995 (the 1995 Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I sought a response to the matters raised in your letter from the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (the `Commission'), which I have now received, and outline below.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 10.05B provides that the Commissioner may publish any information relating to unclaimed moneys. Your question was whether, in developing  the regulation, the Privacy Commissioner was consulted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission, in developing the regulation in conjunction with the Attorney&hyphen;General's Office of Legislative Drafting, did not consult the Privacy Commissioner. However, privacy issues were the reason for, and were considered in, developing the regulation. Since your letter, the Commission has contacted the Privacy Commission, and their response is included in the following paragraphs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Life Insurance Act 1945 contained a similar provision to that contained in Regulation 10.05B, which allowed gazettal of unclaimed moneys information (section 106(8)). The policy position in developing the 1995 Act was to allow publication of the same information in a less expensive format and therefore, to allow for flexibility in publication. It was always the intention to publish this informa tion, and I note that you have recognised the appropriateness of the publication.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission recognised the need for the insertion of a specific regulation after identifying that the disclosure of personal information, without legislative authorisation, may breach Information Privacy Principles. While the policy intent was to publish the information, the legislation did not specifically provide for publication. Disclosure of personal information is necessary in order for a person to determine whether or not they are entitled to make a claim. Information Privacy Principles allows disclosure of personal information in a record where such disclosure is authorised by or under law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Privacy Commissioner was not consulted in developing the regulation because the insertion of the regulation:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> was essential to allow claimants to identify unclaimed moneys; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> facilitated the continuation of previous policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, given your letter, the Commission contacted the Privacy Commission on 9 May 1997, and sought comment on the proposed Regulation. Their response notes the strong public interest grounds for allowing the information to be published. However, while not objecting in principle to the Regulation allowing publication of information, the inclusion of amounts owing is questioned, as it may constitute an unwarranted disclosure of an individual's affairs, and potentially encourage misrepresentation of that individual.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3777"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission accepts this advice, and notes that the regulation states that the Commissioner may publish any of the information contained in an unclaimed monies return. Therefore, the Commissioner may choose not to publish amounts (which I note were published under the 1945 Act). In accordance with the Privacy Commission's advice, the Commission will not include amounts owing in any publication of unclaimed moneys.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope that this information adequately addresses your Committee's concerns.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government accepts the majority recommendation of the Senate Economics Committee Inquiry into Public Equity in Telstra Corporation that the partial sale of Telstra be by way of an issue of ordinary equity in the company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government concurs with the Committee's view that this will be the most effective way of realising the government's objectives for the partial sale which are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> exposure of Telstra to capital market disciplines and scrutiny together with increasing competition from mid 1997 which will be an essential driver of efficiencies in the Company;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a more efficient Telstra brought about by the introduction of a more commercial focus by Telstra management;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the promotion of an internationally competitive, low cost, innovative telecommunications industry; </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> wider share ownership, including by Telstra employees, in one of the fastest growing dynamic industries of the economy; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> sale proceeds to fund the Natural Heritage Trust Fund, $1.1 billion, and for the retirement of public debt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government considers that ordinary shares are optimal as a driver of efficiencies, given that they provide the most direct linkage between company performance and investor returns. Telstra, by its own admission lags world best practice on a number of key efficiency measures for the telecommunications sector. Capital raising options which do not directly link company
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3784"> performance with investor returns would not satisfy this objective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government also agrees with the majority report of the Committee that a capital raising in the region of $8&hyphen;10 billion is best undertaken by way of ordinary equity, given the size of the market for such securities relative to the much smaller, and less well understood, market for hybrid securities in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While recognising that hybrid securities may provide a useful form of capital raising in certain circumstances, the government is mindful of the disadvantages identified in the Committee's report regarding the exclusive use of various types of hybrid securities for the Telstra offer. The range of hybrid securities discussed in the majority report is very broad, encompassing very different features within both redeemable preference share and converting preference share structures. The majority report identifies advantages for Telstra and for the government's wider reform objectives in the use of ordinary equity, in preference to widespread use of hybrid securities of an equity character. Use of hybrid securities of debt character, even apart from any tax issues, would lack the advantages for Telstra and for the government's program that ordinary equity, and securities of an equity character, would have.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report makes a number of statements about the tax treatment of various hybrid instruments in describing the advantages and disadvantages of the various fund raising options. Hybrid securities may be structured to combine a range of characteristics, so that their resemblance to ordinary debt or to ordinary equity is a matter of degree. Generally, however, a particular hybrid security will be predominantly of a debt or of an equity character. This does not merely depend on the formal question of whether it is structured as, say, a converting preference share or as a redeemable preference share.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many different terms and conditions may be attached to hybrid instruments. They may be cumulative, or non&hyphen;cumulative. They may be redeemable, or non&hyphen;redeemable; convertible, or  non&hyphen;convertible. They may be redeemed or converted on a basis which gives the investor the benefit, the risk, or both of movement in the market price for ordinary equity; or they may be redeemed or converted on a basis which gives no such benefit or risk. They may participate fully in control of the issuer, or they may have only limited rights. Whether a particular hybrid instrument is more of a debt or of an equity character depends on the mix of these, and other, terms. However, where an instrument is predominantly of an equity character, the risks and benefits reflected in its redemption or conversion value will generally have to be based on the market value of the issuer&mdash;and so the evidence to the Committee suggests that it is practically difficult to market a hybrid instrument of an equity character unless there is an open market for the equity in the issuer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 46D of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 is designed to apply to particular hybrid securities that are essentially of a debt character. Preference shares may
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have a debt character, and the Treasury advised that a particular form of preference share initially discussed by Senator Harradine would be likely to have that character and would be likely to attract the operation of section 46D. However, the Treasury has consistently advised that the status of a hybrid instrument can only be determined by reference to all its terms, and not by reference to whether it is, in legal form, a redeemable preference share or a converting preference share. It is not the intention of section 46D that redeemable preference shares, no matter at whose option redeemable, must be characterised as always debt or always equity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether the tax treatment of hybrid securities is appropriate, and whether that treatment is fully consistent with the characterisation of a security as debt or as equity, are difficult questions. These questions were not part of the terms of reference of the inquiry, and so could not attract a full range of submissions or evidence from all those who might have an interest in those questions. The government considers that any consideration of the appropriateness of section 46D would depend on an analysis of these questions, taking account of the different tax treatments of debt and of equity and of the scope of tax avoidance that this raises. Such an analysis was outside the scope of the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the line between debt and equity ought to be drawn for tax purposes is considered in the Issues Paper&mdash;Taxation of Financial Arrangements, TOFA, released by the Australian Taxation Office and Treasury in December 1996. Submissions on the TOFA proposals have been requested from all interested parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Harradine's minority report focuses on issues in relation to the sale of infrastructure assets as a primary reason for using redeemable preference shares or some other type of security which would not give rise to private ownership of Telstra's network infrastructure. The regulatory regime for the telecommunications sector, as set out in the Telecommunications Act 1997, recognises the essential nature of these facilities and recognises that there are some specific circumstances where it may be commercially unattractive to construct competing infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government considers that the competitive safeguards and universal service obligation contained in the 1997 telecommunications legislation will provide a sound basis for regulating access to telecommunications network infrastructure, and its provision in areas where competition will develop more slowly, independent of whether such infrastructure is publicly or privately owned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's objectives for the partial privatisation of Telstra reflect the Company's strategic importance in the fastest growing sector in the Australian economy. In such an operating environment, injection of private capital is the surest way to preserve the long term value of Telstra as a major Australian company, through the presence of incentives which optimise feedback on performance. Private equity owners are also more tolerant of the risks of investment in emerging markets than the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3785"> public sector and are therefore more willing to earn risk related returns. Such an investment mind&hyphen;set is crucial to Telstra moving forward in a rapidly changing market place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The injection of private equity ownership is not a process that can be reversed, as mentioned in Senator Harradine's minority report, without the creating the potential for substantial damage to investors' interests, including uncertainty, impeding the effective functioning of capital markets and diminishing the shareholder value of Telstra as a commercial enterprise.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report essentially comes down in a totally predictable manner. It upholds the view that the government's policy is best served by the government following its own policy.

It was made well before the deal was struck to secure the privatisation of Telstra. I find that a farce. I find it extraordinary that this matter could have been given the attention, the public debate and the time that it was when it was quite clear right from the word go that this government was predicating its financing of a whole range of quite nefarious activities upon the privatisation of Telstra, and it was going to secure the privatisation through the securing of votes in this chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely extraordinary. What troubles me most is that Senator Harradine would have known that as well. That is what is most disturbing&mdash;that there was any serious consideration of this measure, given the arrangements that had actually been undertaken to secure the privatisation of Telstra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We well know just how far those arrangements went on the matters that have come before this Senate on a number of occasions in recent times. We well know the way in which the majorities were put together to secure the passage of this particular legislation through the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For my mind, the fundamental issues remain the same in terms of the privatisation of Telstra. There has been no satisfaction in terms of meeting those very grave community concerns about allowing access to advanced telecommunications services for all Australians rather than just the few. There has been no satisfaction of the community concerns about the services being available on the basis of the highest possible equality and the lowest possible price. There has been no satisfaction of public concerns about the fact that public finances themselves are going to be put at risk as a result of this privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before this budget was announced, we saw measures undertaken to borrow $3 billion, financed by the taxpayers, through Telstra in such a manner as to provide international competitiveness by lifting the level of public debt for Telstra. There was no real protection for Australians in terms of increased foreign ownership that will arise directly as a result of that increased debt level. There was no protection for Australians in terms of ownership of what is now and what will be until the time the float actually takes place a publicly owned asset of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been no satisfaction. If anything, it is quite the contrary. Devastation has been wrought upon Telstra&mdash;and especially the Telstra workers&mdash;as a result of the restructuring of that corporation in such a manner
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3786"> that ensures that its focus is now away from community concerns and is instead on more narrow, commercial concerns and the protection of shareholders into the future. In terms of the prospectus, it is quiet apparent that the emphasis in Telstra is now away from its community service obligations and towards the stock markets and those who make up the power behind the whole operation that we see, in terms of the international corporations seeking to get their hands on Australia's telecommunications industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no satisfaction for the local manufacturing industry. They are deeply concerned about the prospect of the loss of valuable contracts and are worried about the importance of our domestic economic sovereignty with the privatisation of Telstra. So those fundamental issues are not resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I find quite extraordinary in this response is that, even in a document this thin, we find that the government has not appropriately considered the matters. It has admitted quite clearly in this response that it has not even considered appropriately the matters that Senator Harradine had raised. Page 3, for instance, says:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was drawing the Senate's attention to the inadequacies of this report and to the quite shameful way in which Telstra has been sold off. An inquiry has been established into
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator Harradine's proposals to try to find alternatives to the direct privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has come down with this report, the answers to which it knew before it set up this inquiry. That is why there is such a flimsy response here. Even within this flimsy response, quite specific reference is made to quite important matters not being adequately considered. They were not adequately considered because the government knew the answers that it wanted to find before it established the inquiry. It had the arrangements in place to secure the privatisation of Telstra. In particular, it had the commitment of Senator Harradine to support the privatisation of Telstra. It had the support of Senator Colston and it had to find a mechanism to try to find a sop to Senator Harradine to justify the consideration that it had given to this matter, which they had rejected time and again, both privately and publicly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an extraordinary farce that we engage in this exercise whereby consideration could possibly be given to a measure which the government had rejected because it knew it had the means by which to secure the passage of the legislation through this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamental concerns remain with the privatisation of Telstra. The Australian people are being grossly short&hyphen;changed by the actions of this government in taking away a public asset and turning it into private hands, to the great disadvantage of the majority of Australians, particularly Australians who live in regional areas. That is the case in Tasmania and Queensland but especially areas in Victoria and New South Wales, which paid disproportionately for the actions of this government to find the various devices to provide that fig leaf of respectability for the actions taken by senators in this parliament to support this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale of Telstra will go down as one of the great disgraces of this parliament. One of the great public corporations has been lost to the people of this country as a result of the actions of this government. I believe they will be actions that this government will come to regret. I suspect that a legacy that many generations of Australia will have to bear will
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3787"> be the loss of this great corporation and the transfer of the public benefit to private benefit. There will be a great consequence and disadvantage to Australians, wherever they may be.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Carr has been speaking a lot of nonsense. First of all, he says that Telstra has been sold. Telstra has not been sold. Does he understand that one-third of Telstra is up for privatisation&mdash;for the people of Australia to have the opportunity to buy shares in one of our great companies? That is what Senator Carr is glossing over. I happen not to desire to see even one-third of Telstra sold. But it was perfectly clear, if anybody around this chamber did not know&mdash;in fact, the government had said&mdash;that had the Senate rejected the bill to sell one-third of Telstra, it would have been proposed again by the House of Representatives after the due constitutional period. Had we rejected it again, the matter would be the subject of a double dissolution. That is a clear message that was given to everybody.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under those circumstances, would Senator Carr have preferred that situation whereby the government, which was riding high at the time, would have been returned and would have sold the lot? Is that what he wanted? Yes, it would be a great political score for him but it would not have been good for the people of Australia or for the people who happen to work for Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say this: there have been substantial reductions in the staff of Telstra. Why? The reason was, in the words of Telstra's chairman, Frank Blount, so as to prepare for the deregulatory environment on 1 July. It had nothing to do with the sale of a third of Telstra. And in fact who was responsible for that? Senator Carr was responsible for that. His party agreed with the government that there should be a deregulatory environment. So, if there are any concerns about that matter, they should be sheeted home to those people who were responsible for that particular decision. From my point of view, I am quite definitely opposed to the sale of a public asset that is a natural monopoly. Although there is going to be competition in the deregu
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> latory environment, I believe Telstra will still be in a situation of monopoly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did actually consider the question, as I have outlined, but I also thought, `If the government is doing so and getting money out of it, why does it want to get the money out of it?' The government wanted $8 billion&mdash;$7 billion to redeem debt and $1 billion for natural heritage. Under those circumstances, I believed that I had to consider my position as a senator for Tasmania and to see what benefit one could gain accordingly. I wrote a letter&mdash;not an open letter but one that I can table in the parliament, and I think that I have already done that&mdash;to the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, in regard to natural heritage, pointing out the pre&hyphen;eminent situation of Tasmania in that particular area and that it deserved more from the proposed Natural Heritage Trust Fund than its population would get based on that particular formula.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After discussions, the government and the minister came back, and eventually a percentage was decided: 10 per cent. How much of that, Senator Carr, do you believe ought to be taken away from Tasmania? Tell us, on behalf of Tasmania. How much do you say of that 10 per cent should be taken from them? Again, in regard to Telstra itself, I believed that there was a need for a number of matters to be considered in respect of my home state of Tasmania to attempt to go some way to offset the losses of jobs that would result from the Labor Party's and the government's policies of deregulation. We did get some recognition of that particular matter in regard to operator assisted services and in regard to a number of other things which I will not go into now. As well, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, did in fact agree that Tasmania should have the lion's share of the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund, which was also established with the prospective proceeds of the third sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to hear from Senator Carr as to whether he thinks that Tasmania got too much out of that. So let there not be an indication that there were deals done. These were open matters which everyone is entitled
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3788"> to hear about&mdash;no secret deals, nothing. I made the judgment on the basis of protecting Telstra so it would be in the majority hands of the government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of this particular matter&mdash;the report of the Economics Legislation Committee's inquiry into public equity in Telstra Corporation Ltd&mdash;I genuinely put forth the proposal that there should be redeemable preference shares. I did that for the very good and valid reason that I believed that one government should not commit a future government if that future government were to desire to buy back the third of Telstra that would have been sold. It could have done that with redeemable preference shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was quite convinced&mdash;and I think that my hunch was correct given what is happening on the stock exchange at the moment&mdash;that there would have been quite a good response, particularly a substantial institutional response, to an offer to take up redeemable preference shares. In my view, there was a need to erase this particular matter on the basis of principle. I assume that my time is nearly concluded, but I would like to go through very seriously for the Senate the reasons why I felt that would be so, and also my concerns that the government should really have gone along that track.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have always been a great supporter of the Australian National Audit Office, particularly their independence, and I have helped them on a number of reports they have made. I have always made the point over the years, though, that when they report on defence matters their methodology limits them from accurately assessing those capabilities in so far as there is always a reserve capability inherent in the defence forces and, if you apply the normal commercial standards of the bottom line judgment, you will always come out with some erroneous figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report opens with a rather shock statement that it costs $6,800 per annum, by their methodology, to maintain a state of health in every member, male and female, serving in the Australian Defence Force. It also quotes a figure of $215 million as the asset value of health facilities in the Defence Force. All of this is in a report that runs to roughly 100 pages, which, in the usual style, has been presented to us but half an hour before it reaches the Senate so that we do not have time to do anything other than skim it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem here is that we do maintain a higher level of health in the defence forces than exists in the general public. Because we maintain that higher level of health, it always means that a lot of elective choices, both in medicine and dentistry, are implemented which would not happen with a private person living in the civilian community. There is also a high emphasis on preventive medicine because the service personnel, male and female, start with the highest of medical standards and it is important, having invested
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3789"> money in their training, that they are maintained in a high state of health. This in part explains the higher cost of medical and dental services to members of the Australian Defence Force. I am not saying that that is the sole reason for it, and I am certainly not saying that there are no inefficiencies in the program, but there is simply no recognition of the factors that I have mentioned in the report as I see it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to deal briefly with the reserve capabilities. The provision of medical services for the defence forces does require the capability to deal with people who are injured in hostilities, on active service. Those facilities are  extremely expensive. If we look at what has happened this century and we look at the huge casualty rates for the First World War and we look at the casualty rates for the Second World War, when medical technology was nowhere near as sophisticated as it is today, we see that there is a huge difference in the number of deaths of personnel in those two conflicts. That was due to the improved medical services&mdash;getting better antibiotic drugs and better surgical procedures principally&mdash;available to troops who were wounded in the field. Of course, in Vietnam it was only 20 or 25 minutes from injury to a casualty  clearing station by helicopter evacuation. Again, we saw a significant lowering of the mortality rates and also morbidity rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision of all those facilities is expensive. One of the things that happened to the ADF under the Labor government was the dismantling of the really excellent services we had which were reservist based. The specialist services in medicine and dentistry, the field hospitals and field ambulances we had were largely run down. Part of that capability has been lost and it is one of the duties of this government to reconstruct that. But that is a story for another time and another place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my fears when this reserve capability is not recognised, though, is that some bureaucrats will move in and subject the few remaining hospitals that we have to a commercial support program. Then we would probably lose the few permanent hospitals that now exist in the Australian Defence Force, because I do not doubt that facilities like the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> new hospital at Enoggera can be privatised, and I think that the capability of the ADF would suffer enormously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do believe there are savings to be made from having one stream administering the medical and the dental service for all three services. Certainly aviation medicine is different from what is required of a ship's doctor on a destroyer or something like that, but basically the differences in the medical services provided for the army, navy and air force are no greater than the differences that exist in the medical service today between anaesthetists and surgeons and physicians and endocrinologists. They are all part of the one family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We seem to have gone down the path of the worst of the Canadian system in this country. We have not dealt with the obvious areas that could be combined. I go back many years to when I was a student and it was said then that medical services for all three services would be combined and it would be just one service. That is nearly 40 years ago and nothing has happened up until this latest defence efficiency review, and I hope that something will be implemented there. We have not done the obvious with respect to combining services but we have adopted some of the worst features of the Canadian system, and particularly with respect to putting all power in the hands of the Chief of the Defence Force and diminishing the power of the chiefs of staff, and putting all power in Headquarters ADF rather than in the individual service headquarters. Again, that is a story for another day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do believe that we could have a common medical service from an administrative point of view for the army, navy and air force the same as we could have a common service for cooks and for much of the technical training, certainly in the basic levels of technical training. At the end of the day, the maintenance of the health of the ADF is a big job and is a vital task. We put a lot of focus on training and equipment for the defence forces, but all of that is in vain if the personnel who operate it are not healthy when they are required to be so.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3790">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone forgets the huge problems we had in the Second World War when the army and the air force were operating in New Guinea. We had huge casualty rates from malaria until effective anti-malarial regimes were introduced both from a preventative point of view and from a chemotherapeutic point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will touch on some of the recommendations briefly. The first recommendation deals with the maintenance of a minimal level of health service resources. It is an unfortunate emphasis to be talking about the minimal level of health services rather than phrasing it in terms of maintaining the maximum level of health for members of the ADF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recommendation 2 deals with the apparent high cost of maintaining the health services as they are for the ADF. The inference there is that members of the defence forces get more than they would get in civilian life. One of the compensatory benefits of service in the ADF has always been that you got good medical and dental services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recommendation 6 proposes that the Surgeon&hyphen;General have overall administration of the health services. That is in line with what I was saying earlier, but he has to be supported with adequate resources because it is a very big job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recommendation 9 is quite important because it talks about a detailed costing of all ADF hospitals and medical centres. I fear there that we will lose a very considerable reserve capability if that is subject to a CSP because then we will not be able to train service personnel in a service environment. There are many more points that could be mentioned there, but there are other speakers to this motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Until one can actually see the savings to be made under that sort of recommendation, one must have some doubts because one might be sacrificing the efficiency of our Defence Force medical services by contracting out such services. Under `Financial administration', the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a consequence, the ADF cannot identify the full cost of operating its health services and facilities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I can share some concern there that the costs cannot be identified but, by the same token, in a Defence Force one might not necessarily be able to get down to the exact dollars and cents as one might find in other areas. The
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3791"> other area of concern is in the recommendations. Recommendation 2, which Senator MacGibbon referred to, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO recommends that Defence assess the merits and possible implications of a member contribution for any health services additional to those required for the maintenance of individual readiness or that are outside the ADF's duty of care to its employees.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was one of the recommendations that Defence did not disagree with but said that there was a substantial departmental policy issue which will require a comprehensive study by the department before a response can be given. If I interpret that recommendation correctly, it means an additional cost impost for those people in the ADF. I believe that, under all circumstances, if that is the implication to be taken out of that recommendation, that particular recommendation should be rejected. Throughout the estimates processes and other processes of this Senate, I will undoubtedly be placing close scrutiny on the application of this audit report to find out more of the efficiencies that can be gained and if they are really material efficiencies that will assist the defence forces.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak to this Australian National Audit Office report today, I am mindful of one of the key findings, and that  is `potential for achieving economies through rationalisation or civilianisation of non-operational services'. I refer to the use of the word `rationalisation'. Lately, we have seen the use of this word, which has meant cutting costs, cutting services and making users pay. I just hope that that is not what is being anticipated there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two areas that I would like to briefly dwell on tonight and, like other senators, I will be following up this in estimates as well. The first one is organisation and staffing. I notice that paragraph 3.6 deals with a medical assistants course. I have some concerns about some of the lesser health professionals within the ADF, other than doctors, nurses, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder about some of the training&mdash;I will be pursuing this&mdash;that medical assistants, sick bay attendants and the like in the three services are given and whether it is comparable
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with civilian training. We are seeing much more these days a move within the ADF that all of the training that is given to their personnel has a comparable equivalent in the civilian sector, so that their skills are transferable across the sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have grave concerns I want to pursue, and will be pursuing further, about the level of training of these people&mdash;that it is comparable&mdash;and that there is not the risk of medico&hyphen;legal problems if these people undertake tasks that are beyond their training levels, particularly in the administering of some of the schedule 8 drugs and maybe some of the other procedures that are usually undertaken by doctors and nurses because it is within their registration and legally they are entitled to do it under the legislation of the various states. I am wondering how these matters are dealt with in the ADF. I know that there would be emergency times out in the field and in combat, but this is something that we have to watch very carefully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One recommendation causes me great concern, and I speak here as a registered nurse and as a member of the Royal College of Nursing in the New South Wales College. That is recommendation No. 6, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO recommends that the Surgeon General be given responsibility for the command and control of all ADF health resources, that appropriate human and financial resourcing be transferred to OSGADF and that the formal agreements be developed with operational commanders in relation to the provision of resources for operational purposes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not have a not a problem with that, but I have a problem with what might well be their interpretation of all health resources going to the Surgeon General. Paragraph 3.16 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO considers that more effective management of health services could be achieved if the Surgeon General had full control, rather than technical control, of ADF health services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The question I ask is: what gives a doctor the right to decide what nursing treatment and what nursing care is the appropriate nursing care? Nurses these days, the senior nurses within the ADF, are highly qualified. They have degrees; they have qualifications in specialist areas of nursing. Most of them have
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3792"> higher qualifications in health administration&mdash;not just nursing administration, but health administration. Because of their specific expertise within the ADF, one must look at what qualifications they would bring to the general health management within the ADF. There are other health professionals also, not just doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is incumbent upon the ADF to step forward into the 21st century, not back into the 19th century and the days of the Crimean War when Florence Nightingale was rendering her nursing aid to soldiers at the front. It is incumbent upon the ADF to recognise the professional qualifications, skills and training that people in the health services in the ADF&mdash;other than doctors&mdash;have obtained. I do not want to appear to be denigrating the skills and the qualifications of the Surgeon General or any of the doctors that are working within the ADF health services, but I have a grave concern, if I am interpreting this correctly&mdash;I hope I am interpreting this the wrong way&mdash;that nursing decisions will be taken out of the hands of nurses; dental decisions will be taken out of the hands of dentists; and physiotherapy decisions will be taken out of the hands of physiotherapists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gone are the days when the doctor had sole control and command of what was the best  thing for a patient. Patient care is a team effort these days; all people should be involved. There is no reason why ADF health requirements and health needs should be any different from anybody else's health needs. I will certainly be pursuing that with a great deal more interest as time goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue that I find interesting is that they actually start to look at occupational health and safety. When women started to become active within the ADF, when they started to have jobs in non-traditional roles and when they started to get out closer to the front line, we suddenly had people saying, `Oh, but a woman can't lift a 50-pounder'&mdash;or whatever the gun size was or whatever the shell size was&mdash;`She's too frail; she's too fragile. She can't lift those sorts of weights, lump that sort of load, move whatever has to be moved.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They failed to take into consideration that the strength of some women can be greater than the strength of a small, slightly built male. But because someone was a male in the ADF, it was assumed that they could therefore move this object. Women going into the ADF has brought about a reassessment in some cases of just what skills are needed and what the procedures are for moving and carrying. They are encouraging people to utilise ergonomically safe practices within occupational health and safety guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a pretty poor indictment, I think, that the ADF does not know actuarially just what the cost is of occupational health and safety injuries and problems and that most of those problems come to light when someone is discharged or separated from the ADF and they put in claims before they leave so that they will be recognised if problems come later in life. One needs to look very carefully at the situations that we place people in, the things we ask them to do and the loads we ask them to lift and manoeuvre. I know that, on occasions, they will be required to move large, heavy loads and to undertake this work, but the ADF needs to apply a lot of the same principles that we are applying to occupational health and safety everywhere else in this country, and that deal with the safety of the workers. It is a very important issue and I am glad that it is being looked at and that a number of recommendations have been made. I look forward to continuing to pursue the outcome of these recommendations and their future direction. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government believes that the work for the dole initiative recently outlined by the Prime Minister will have substantial benefits to the individual participants and the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since it was announced the government has received strong public support for the work for the dole initiative. Many Australians believe that it is fair and reasonable that those being supported by the community should make a contribution in return.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Young people themselves are also looking for ways to contribute positively to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The value of the work for the dole initiative lies in bringing young unemployed people back into a work culture to help instil a positive attitude to work. It will give young people a chance to engage with the community rather than being alienated from it.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill would provide for the changes necessary to implement the government's work for the dole initiative in a way which is consistent with feedback the government has had from the community. At the same time the initiative is based firmly on the principle of mutual obligation: that it is fair and just that people receiving unemployment allowances be asked to make a contribution to the community in return.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government recognises that the work for the dole initiative is not a solution to youth unemployment and has not represented as such. Real jobs can only be created by the government providing a business environment that secures our economic future. The government's strong but fair budget has put downward pressure on interest rates. Policies for small business will reduce the paperwork burden for small business, and capital gains tax relief on the sale of businesses provides an incentive to small business owners to expand their businesses. The abolition of the previous government's unfair dismissal laws has removed a significant disincentive for business to take on new employees and it will encourage more productive labour relations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government recognises that the particular disadvantages young people face in getting jobs are structural&mdash;the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> low skilled jobs that young people used to take on leaving school have gradually disappeared and those jobs that remain are increasingly being taken by older and more experienced job seekers. Fundamental reforms are necessary to deal with this&mdash;to make sure that young people are better prepared before they enter the labour market. We need to strengthen the relationship between schools and the workplace to provide young people with the means to overcome these disadvantages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of recent government initiatives are already addressing these fundamental issues. These include the new national apprenticeship and traineeship system, our numeracy and literacy strategy to ensure that students acquire appropriate standards of competence in these areas and the introduction of incentives to complete vocational education courses through the jobs pathway program which provides job placement assistance to those students who successfully complete vocational education courses in year 11 and year 12.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of pilot work for the dole projects should also be seen in the broader context of the government's commitments to young Australians through the government's reforms to employment services, legislation for which is also currently before the parliament. Complementary strategies are also being put in place to address other important youth issues such as family breakdown, youth suicide and homelessness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government considers the work for the dole initiative will combat the drift to despair and despondency felt by many unemployed young people. The government considers that young job seekers should be given the chance to add to their experience and prove their work ethic through participation in projects which are supported by the community and will be of lasting value to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Aim of the legislation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of this legislation is to establish the framework necessary for implementation of pilot work for the dole projects. In particular the bill would amend the Social Security Act 1991 to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Remove provisions precluding measures to compel a person to work in return for the payment of unemployment allowance;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Enable a person to voluntarily participate in a programme of work which has been approved by the employment secretary or to be required to participate in such a programme;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provide for participation in an approved programme of work to be included in Newstart activity agreements;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provide for an approved programme of work supplement of $20 per fortnight for participants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 would also establish that participation in work for the dole would not give rise to an employer/employee relationship for the purposes of the following acts:
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3795"> </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Occupational Health And Safety (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1991;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Workplace Relations Act 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is expected that participation in work for the dole projects would be largely voluntary, the bill provides that a person may be required to work in a programme of work approved by the employment secretary in return for the payment of unemployment allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person may only be required to participate in a work for the dole project if they are in receipt of full rate unemployment allowance and there is no risk to personal health or any contravention of occupational health and safety laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government recognises that participants in work for the dole projects will incur additional costs. The bill provides that an extra $20 per fortnight be paid as a supplement to their unemployment allowance in recognition of the additional costs of participating in work for the dole projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is cognisant of its international obligations. It has taken advice of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department that a work for the dole  initiative should not contravene our international obligations, provided that the work offered under work for the dole is "suitable and reasonable" for that person. The fact that payment of unemployment allowance is not based on any prior mandatory contribution, combined with the positive benefits of work for the dole for participants means that the initiative should be regarded as reasonable in its requirement of a contribution to the community from participants.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within the legislative framework, we envisage publicly seeking submissions across the whole of Australia. Submissions would be price competitive. Host organisations would be responsible for supervision, essential training, any transportation costs to work sites, minor personal equipment and required clothing such as safety boots or clothing necessary for public contact situations. Appropriate insurance coverage will be arranged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regions with highest levels of youth unemployment would be the focus of the pilots, with an emphasis on non&hyphen;metropolitan regions. About 50 pilot projects would be allocated to these identified regions, with about another 20 projects available to ensure that quality projects from anywhere could be approved having regard to the need for broad geographic coverage during the pilot phase.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is targeting regional Australia in the pilot stage for many reasons, not the least of which is because our rural communities perhaps best illustrate the disastrous results of thirteen years of Labor's economic
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mismanagement. All communities have witnessed the fabric of our Australian society unravel under labor. Initiatives such as "work for the dole" are important steps towards repairing the damage of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pilot work for the dole projects would be for a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 12 months duration. They would be selected on the basis of criteria which would include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The needs of the local unemployed young people;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capacity of the sponsor to monitor and maintain the project;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extent of contribution and support for the project from the local community;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The quality of community involvement; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Preparedness of the community to support the participants after completion of their placement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A primary test would be the benefit of the project to the wider community and not to a private sector interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A committee including expertise independent of&mdash;individuals who are well known in the community and committed to the initiative&mdash;would be involved in the final selection of projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim is to have about 10,000 places in the pilot work for the dole projects&mdash;with the first expected to start in September 1997. There would be no minimum size for projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Referral to projects would as far as possible be voluntary with the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency (CSDA) and the project sponsor advertising the availability of projects. If the response from volunteers did not provide enough participants, the CSDA would identify and notify eligible clients that they were to be compulsorily referred. Within certain limits, project sponsors would be given a degree of choice in relation to the selection of participants for particular projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Participants in the work for the dole pilots would primarily be 18 to 24 year olds who have been unemployed for at least 6 months. However, priority would be given to those unemployed for over 12 months who were not in case management or employment assistance and not likely to be referred to these within 6 months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some locations there may be some flexibility regarding the age and duration of unemployment of participants, especially where there were insufficient numbers of young people to fill projects. In addition, some projects would benefit significantly from including older job seekers to help supervise younger participants and pass on expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"~Based on averaged national training wage award level c rates, participants would work for two six hour days if aged 18 to 20 years and two and a half six hour days if aged 21 years or over. They would be required to participate for a maximum of 6 months each.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3796"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Participants in the initiative requiring child care would be able to use existing child care arrangements for labour market programme participants so as not to disadvantage participants with children requiring care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The work for the dole initiative is not designed to artificially manipulate the measured rate of youth unemployment. The Australian bureau of statistics has advised that it is unlikely that the initiative would have a noticeable impact on youth unemployment statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initiative is different from the previous government's programmes in that participants would continue to receive their unemployment allowance payments and would still be required to look for work. However, in recognition of the time spent on the work for the dole initiative, job search requirements for participants would be reduced to the minimum department of social security requirement of two employer contacts per fortnight. The existing standard unemployment allowance provisions of compliance and breaching arrangements  would also apply to the work for the dole initiative. In line with existing arrangements, "clean slate" provisions would be adopted whereby if a person who is subject to an activity test or administrative breach agrees to a work for the dole placement their payment would be reinstated from the time of their commencement on the initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pilot work for the dole projects would be evaluated to assess the impact of the initiative on young people and to assist consideration of expansion of the initiative beyond the pilot stage, including the scope for expanding into different regions. A first report of the evaluation will provide a basis for decision making in the 1998&hyphen;99 budget.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to conclude the Democrats' contribution to this debate. A number of issues were brought to my notice since the Hearing Services and AGHS Reform Bill 1997 was referred to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee, for instance, the use of audiometrists or technicians and associated health risks, the tendering process itself, the value of vouchers and so forth, the capacity of the Office of Hearing Services to adequately monitor the provision of services and the threat of viability of the local hearing device manufacturer, and there were a number of others, too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the debate on this bill was adjourned yesterday, I have had further discussions with consumer groups, and I understand that working groups have been established and agreement has been largely reached on these issues and processes. I understand that the outcomes of these discussions will form the basis of regulations which will come before the Senate in the form of disallowable instruments by the end of June. So I am satisfied that the protections are or will be in place and that consumer groups and appropriate other parties are involved in the discussions.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3797">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are, I suppose, less supportive of the measures the government appeared to be obliged to adopt in order to satisfy that ideological pursuit of competition policy and the somewhat artificial way in which it had originally proposed to create the so-called level competitive playing field. But provided that the existing Australian based business Crystalaid or Bernafon is not artificially constrained and that this organisation is not deliberately nobbled in order to advance other organisations&mdash;most of which are, as I understand it, reliant on imported components&mdash;and as long as the tender processes are fair, the Democrats will support this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the Senate that competition policy reform was an initiative of the ALP. So I fail to understand why it is that the opposition proposes to now vote against this bill. The provision relating to young people aged 18 to 21 has been restored by way of amendment, as has the provision for senior health care card holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is our desire to see that Australian Hearing Services continues to be an excellent public provider of hearing services, but we also recognise the reality of competition policy. In this, as in so many other pieces of legislation, we continue to argue that the ideology of competition should not lead to the sorts of absurdities that we have seen, for instance, in telecommunications and it should not force any extra costs onto taxpayers which are not reflected in improved services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an imperative to have this legislation passed in order to meet the government's 1 July deadline. We do not want to in any way delay the passage of the bill. We do hope that the government will accept the amendment in relation to senior health care card holders and that this bill can be accepted in the lower house. With that, I conclude my remarks for the Democrats.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that the minister says, `At last,' and I certainly join him in that sentiment. This is a bill colloquially known as the diesel fuel rebate bill. Initially, it should be said that diesel fuel taxes were imposed on vehicle users to cover the cost of road construction in Australia. However, it has now  been extended and is imposed on all users of diesel fuel. Because a tax on miners, on the gas industry and on agriculturalists would be an input tax&mdash;that is, a cost to business, pushing up prices in the marketplace and making domestic producers uncompetitive&mdash;the government provides a rebate to those industries&mdash;that is, a return of their tax once paid on diesel fuel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has now happened, however, is that diesel fuel rebate has become, within the meaning of this government, a political football. It is now a revenue raiser for the government, which has sought to narrow the focus of the rebate and the entitlement for claimants as a consequence. The original purpose of the rebate has been lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Australia, the cost of a litre of diesel fuel is 59c. That is a 31c per litre tax and a 28c per litre cost. If we did not have the diesel fuel tax, diesel fuel would cost 28c. The tax, as I say, is 31c. It raised, according to the budget papers, $1.6 billion in 1995&hyphen;1996. In the current financial year, it is estimated to raise $1.38 billion. It is, in budgetary terms, a big ticket item.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I turn to the issues that on behalf of the opposition I wish to address on this bill,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> can I say that I have noted the arguments of the Australian Democrats and the Greens, where they support the government's legislation. Their support is basically and broadly couched around the concept of opposing mining and supporting the environment, thus seeing mining as an anti&hyphen;environmental measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reject the arguments that have been put by the Greens and the Democrats in supporting the government on this bill. Those arguments are facile in logic and, as a consequence, do not deal with the important issues of balancing development and environmental matters in a way in which the employment, the job creating needs and the economic growth of this country are balanced against the very important and vital need to protect our environmental concerns. I do not intend to deal in detail with the arguments put by my colleagues from the Australian Democrats and from the Greens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill that is before the parliament is nothing more than a money grab from industry by the government. It is a bill that I would contend is unnecessary. It is a bill from which the government has largely excused the agricultural industry for political reasons&mdash;political reasons made clear by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). It is a bill that concentrates pre&hyphen;eminently on the mining sector, and it has set the mining sector a savings target of $95 million. The government has done so in order to fill the so&hyphen;called budget black hole and as an exercise in negative cost cutting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will cite four basic reasons for the Labor opposition opposing this legislation. Negative cost cutting is the first. What this government has not done&mdash;and the inquiry into this legislation made it very clear&mdash;is conduct a study of this industry to see what the economic, social and employment effects of changing this tax are. What it has done is decided to simply narrow the focus for the rebate, grab some $95 million out of the industry sector and push up prices by increasing costs to mining companies, making them more uncompetitive in the international marketplace. No assessment has been done of what further investment would have been generated had that money grab not occurred, what other jobs
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3799"> would have been created because of that further investment, or how the industry might have expanded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One cannot argue in budgetary terms that cutting costs is the only way to get rid of a deficit. Backing industries that are the lifeblood of this country and that can grow the economy, create jobs, increase economic development and generate revenue on the revenue side of the budget is the other way of removing the deficit. This government is indicted because it has not even bothered to do these fundamental sums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reason we oppose this legislation is because it unequivocally breaks an election undertaking. Before the last election the Treasurer (Mr Costello) made a great feature of saying that there would be no new taxes and no extension of existing taxes. The budget papers say that this bill will raise $440 million over four years. The explanatory memorandum gives a higher amount than that.  Industry expects that this bill and the actions being taken by the government will raise some $720 million over four years. That shows not only that the government cannot do its sums but also that this is clearly an extension of tax. By narrowing the entitlement, the tax is extended and a core promise of this government is broken. That is a reason why this bill should be opposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third reason I offer is the undertakings that the government has breached in its dealings with industry. I said at the beginning of my remarks that the government announced before the budget before last that the diesel fuel rebate was on the cost cutting agenda. It let off the agricultural sector for political reasons. A by&hyphen;election in the state of New South Wales, in which the National Party was defeated because of the impact of the guns issue, meant that the Prime Minister gave the NFF a wink and a nod guarantee that there would be no tax on them as far as diesel fuel rebate was concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The full impact fell on the mining industry. And the mining industry around Australia&mdash;particularly in my home state of Western Australia&mdash;will be one of the areas that most severely bears this cost the government wishes
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to raise. The industry established a high&hyphen;level negotiating group which went into talks with the government. In those negotiations, they were faced with the threat that the rebate would be taken away entirely if the industry did not concede areas of so&hyphen;called reasonable claim. The industry went along with that proposition and conceded areas for the rebate to be pocketed by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In chess terms, the industry decided to give up a few pawns in order to save their queen. There were three problems for the industry in this strategy. The first of those problems was that they did not succeed in saving their queen at all. The prime interest of the industry was to get a guarantee from the government that, by conceding areas where the rebate would be forgone, there would be no cap on growth in the remaining legitimate areas. The government has not given that guarantee and still remains in a situation of not giving that guarantee. That was the trade&hyphen;off. That is a breach of faith by the government in these negotiations and, as a consequence, I draw the chamber's attention to my second reading amendment, which I propose to move at the end of my speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reason why the strategy of the industry failed is that some of the areas they did not give up in the industry negotiations are now, by this bill, claimed by the government as their entitlement. So it was not a fair negotiation. They lost in that area as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, some of the areas they gave up were vital industries which ought to be considered in their own right. But they were not front and centre industries that are affected by the mining sector and were, therefore, `soft' concessions by the mining sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take the salt industry. As a consequence of this bill, if it is carried, Dampier Salt in Western Australia will pay $800,000 in extra taxes to the government&mdash;so much for the promise of no new taxes! That will impact on employment and on the profitability of that company. There is no doubt in my mind that CRA conceded the Dampier Salt issue because they did not want the diesel fuel rebate to be narrowed to Hamersley Iron and their other major mining concerns. But, if you look at the salt industry in their own right and their
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3800"> entitlement here, they are a major and important industry in the state of Western Australia. They won a long court battle to establish their entitlement. This legislation would simply put at nil all those legal arguments which have been so long in being established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My fourth reason for opposing this bill is that the taxing agent here is the Customs Service. The Customs Service is a service that I have had more than nodding acquaintance with. It is an admirable service, and I pay recognition to it. But it is not a service that specialises in the mining industry. It does not know this industry well and, in this exercise, it is being sooled onto the mining industry like an attack dog to take whatever money it can&mdash;through the guise of the diesel fuel rebate&mdash;to meet the target set by the Treasurer for the so&hyphen;called black hole. And it has done that with enthusiasm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence, this bill is fatally flawed in many respects. There will be massive unintended consequences once it is pro claimed&mdash;if it is&mdash;and there will be continuing litigation over terms and conditions contained in this legislation, if it becomes law. We have seen a situation where major industry sectors have had to go to court to establish their right. That situation will continue. That is a consequence of a not very thorough and too shallow understanding of the importance, significance and detail of technical matters surrounding how mining is conducted in Australia, of how offshore oil and gas search and development is conducted in this country and of the implications for smaller mining holdings, as well as for farmers in some circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give the chamber an example of the sorts of complaints that I refer to. A fishing boat sailing out of the port of Dampier is entitled to claim the diesel fuel rebate. A safety boat sailing out of the very same port of Dampier to service the offshore oil rigs&mdash;which stands off an oil rig as a legal requirement for safety reasons&mdash;cannot claim the diesel fuel rebate under this legislation. That is not just odd; that is unfair. A mandatory government requirement requires that boat to be there if the industry is to carry on its activities at all.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to another example. Heavy vehicles on mine sites are able to claim under this legislation, but light vehicles on mine sites are not. That goes to an argument about the type of mine site, the size of the mine and the type of vehicles required. There is no doubt that light vehicles are, in certain circumstances, essential to a mining operation and, where they work on a lease, ought not be discriminated against&mdash;and smaller companies ought not be discriminated against.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said one or two words about the salt industry earlier. The salt industry is an important industry in Australia. They have won a legal entitlement for coverage for this rebate. They are disenfranchised by the legislation if this legislation is to go forward. But they are not the only industry that is caught in that circumstance. The cement industry, which has had legal action on foot to protect its own right, is also now to be, under this legislation, removed from entitlement. It is to be removed from entitlement because of a definition where mining for limestone, as the ore body for calcite, the essential ingredient for the manufacture of cement, is termed as quarrying and not represented as mining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the four reasons that I refer to as to why the opposition does not support this legislation&mdash;that this is an example of negative cost cutting; that this breaks an election undertaking; that this breaks in three ways the undertakings that the minister and the government gave when they started talks with the industry about settling what this package would contain; and the inappropriateness of the way in which the Customs Service has defined elements of this industry and the technical problems created under the legislation for that reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been a bill that the industry has, in evidence before a Senate committee inquiring into this legislation, uniformly panned. It has uniformly panned it because, by narrowing the entitlement for the rebate, the indirect taxes or the input tax which diesel fuel represents is increased on the industry. On the frontispiece of the Mining Council's submission to the Senate Economics Legislation
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3801"> Committee inquiry, there is an illustrative graph of how uncompetitive Australian companies are made against a number of other major mining powers in the world&mdash;companies they compete against in the international marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia with a diesel fuel rebate&mdash;and that is a full diesel fuel rebate, not the rebate countenanced in this legislation&mdash;pays a cost of 28c for diesel fuel. Canada is a major competitor for Australia in the mining industry: it pays 25c. Chile is another major competitor in the mining industry: it pays 24c. Indonesia, a fourth major competitor in this industry, and one in our region, pays 21c. So Australian competitors in the world market for a price sensitive industry are put at a disadvantage by government legislation. Since the minister for resources is at the table I should make the observation that, while he is an active and positive booster for this industry, nonetheless, he is here today as an agent, putting taxes on this industry, which will limit  its ability to grow and create employment and jobs in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude my remarks in this debate tonight by drawing attention to the fact that yesterday Western Australia became fully representative in this chamber, with all 12 senators taking their seats. The new senator from Western Australia, whom I have not yet had the opportunity to meet, Senator Ross Lightfoot, has not yet given his maiden speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill and the government's position on this bill represents a challenge to him in a direct sense. It represents a challenge to all Western Australian senators, Queensland senators and senators where the mining industry is a key sector of their state economies. In Senator Lightfoot's <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">case, it represents a very direct challenge to him, because he is on the public record as a member of the Legislative Council in Western Australia as someone whose prime job it is to protect the interests of the mining industry. Here is a case in which Labor, taking a balanced approach to the needs of all industry and a responsible approach to the needs of the national economy as well as the federal budget, recognises
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that changes need to be made. On this occasion, I think the challenge to Senator Lightfoot is to join us and vote with us on many of the amendments we will move.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wanted to open by referring to comments by Senator Vanstone today in question time. Senator Vanstone, when dealing with some questions about cuts in funding to the Australian Federal Police and a reduction in the number of police, talked about the concept of achieving more with less. I must say that senators on this side of the chamber were somewhat incredulous at that statement and I want to look at that statement in the context of something that is happening in the city of Launceston, the city in which I have my office in the state of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight there is a public meeting taking place. It will commence in about 10 minutes. It is about the Tasmanian fire service and its plans to reduce the suburban fire station at Rocherlea to an office hours operation. I believe there are similar plans which are held for fire stations at Rokeby on the eastern shore of Hobart and the Hobart central fire station.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must confess that I am somewhat stunned that the fire service can decide that somehow fires should only take place during the hours of eight in the morning to five in the evening Monday to Friday. Residents of the northern suburbs of Launceston, which is the area of Launceston that the Rocherlea fire station occupies, cannot feel comfortable about their safety when, at the times that most people are in their homes, particularly their children, the fire services are proposed to be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This cut will mean a substantial reduction in the fire protection that the citizens of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3802"> Launceston will receive, in particular from the Rocherlea professional fire crew. Rocherlea and the neighbouring suburb of Mowbray are high fire risk areas and the reality is that most of these fires occur at night. There are currently only three professional fire crews in Launceston at any given time in a city of 98,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The plans of the Tasmanian fire service will mean that for 75 per cent of the time there will only be two crews. This is a threat not only to the community but to the firefighters themselves. The ability of firefighters to obtain backup from other crews at emergencies is vital to their safety. If this cut occurs and there are two fires simultaneously in Launceston that will mean that neither crew will have access to a backup crew. They will be left exposed and without help. The Tasmanian fire service is obviously failing in its duty of care in relation to employee safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what of this more with less philosophy? Certainly, a cut in the number of firefighters in Tasmania will lead to a more with less  result. Less firefighters means more risk to firefighters' lives. Less firefighters means more risk to the lives of citizens. And less firefighters means more risk of loss of property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to point out to senators the impact of time in a response to a fire. Within five minutes from observance and notification, fire damage can be limited perhaps to one room in a house and a family may be rescued and resuscitated. If notification and arrival occur within 10 minutes, the fire would most likely have spread to other rooms, causing suffocating and blinding smoke, with the dangers that those circumstances would occasion. Within 15 minutes, many houses would be consumed by fire. The loss of vital minutes can be the difference between minimum damage and extensive damage to property and, more importantly, between life and death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Tasmanian fire service has already lost one in 14 of its firefighting officers over the last nine months through natural attrition. Ten years ago there were 50 per cent more firefighters on shift than there are today. The Tasmanian fire service has commenced
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enterprise bargaining with the employees and this is the result of it. Employees have been offered an eight per cent wage increase over a 25&hyphen;month period but must accept cuts across the board to firefighting numbers and fire stations. They must accept a 30 per cent cut in the number of 24&hyphen;hour fire stations in the state, with a further one in eight firefighting jobs to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members of the United Firefighters Union of Australia have coined a slogan: `Firefighters save lives, we don't trade them.' The safety of the citizens of Launceston and the hardworking men and women in the fire service are not, in their view, a tradeable item. Enterprise bargaining should be about improvements to service delivery: it should not be about cutting costs for the sake of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More with less? An inappropriate philosophy where lives and safety are concerned. I would like to congratulate the United Firefighters Union on their successful rally in Launceston's Civic Square today and say that I wish them well on behalf of the Tasmanian community because what they are fighting for is in the interest of that community.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="3802"><TITLE>Queensland Criminal Justice Commission</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most senators would know that I have been involved in issues relating to whistleblowing for most of my time in the Senate. In fact, this speech follows one I gave last night, but about a different whistleblower.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a member of the second Senate committee on whistleblowing issues. Many of the cases covered in the committee's inquiry centred around Queensland and I have continued to follow the whistleblowing issue and some of the specific cases with interest. I am concerned about the lack of action on this matter on the part of the coalition since it came into government last year. I believe they gave a pre&hyphen;election commitment to do something about the need for greater legislative protection for whistleblowers but so far there appears to have been no action at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of my purpose in speaking tonight is to remind the government and the public that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3803"> this is an issue which will not go away and one which needs to be addressed. There has been a lot of concern expressed in recent months about the further decline in public confidence in institutions of government. It is almost in epidemic proportions. That is why action on the part of whistleblowers, for example, would be one positive step which could be taken to reverse this situation. It would give ordinary people more confidence that if they do take issue and blow the whistle they will be protected and that their actions will be complimented instead of their becoming the target of all kinds of retribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I indicate to the Senate tonight that it is my intention to introduce a draft bill to protect whistleblowers. I would hope that would be a spur to the government to do what they said they were going to do. We can only hope. This bill will be based on much of the work of the two Senate inquiries&mdash;one of which was chaired by Senator Murphy, and chaired very well&mdash;and also on the whistleblowers protection bill, which was introduced by another former senator who was very interest ed in whistleblowing, former Senator Chamarette.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one can deny that there are still many examples of corruption and maladministration which need to be exposed. It is important that governments take more action to encourage whistleblowers to come forward and then to protect those who do. Unfortunately, the shoot the messenger approach still seems to be the norm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make mention tonight of Dr William De Maria, who is a researcher and lecturer at the University of Queensland's social work and social policy department. Dr De Maria gave evidence on his research to the Senate inquiry and has done some pioneering work in researching the case histories of many whistleblowers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to highlight the value of the work which was done by Dr De Maria and his researchers. His work has focused predominantly on the public sector in Queensland, but there is little doubt that similar problems exist throughout Australia. If I wanted to be paro
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> chial, I could say that universities in Queensland have a tendency to produce high quality research. Certainly, Dr De Maria's work should be seen as bringing credit to the University of Queensland's social work department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there was one disturbing aspect of Dr De Maria's study into whistleblowing which comes not from his report but from the reaction which he received as a consequence of it. This is an illustration of the very problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the details from the study were released, the credibility of the research and the researcher was attacked by the then Premier, Mr Goss. Mr Goss was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper alleging that Dr De Maria had made up details in at least one of the cases contained in his research&mdash;a serious accusation. In the state parliament on 12 April 1994, Mr Goss again attacked Dr De Maria, using material provided by the CJC, and again accused him of `frequently giving inaccurate details of whistleblowers' situations to the media'&mdash;again, a very serious accusation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I support an ongoing role for the CJC in Queensland, I am afraid my experience with whistleblower issues has somewhat dented my confidence in their ability to competently investigate and report on complaints. This is a classic case where the CJC, in response to a request from the Premier, had tried to identify the whistleblower referred to in a newspaper report on Dr De Maria's study. The CJC contacted Dr De Maria and, when he told them that he took the usual steps to protect the identity of whistleblowers when he was speaking about their cases, the CJC reported this in a pejorative way to imply significant falsification of details.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CJC, in pursuing its investigations to back up its refuting of Dr De Maria's credibility, then provided details of the wrong case to `prove' its point. The real whistleblower concerned in the case later went public to confirm the accuracy of Dr De Maria's research and to support him against this attack on his academic credentials.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3804">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be few allegations more serious against an academic than that of falsifying research. Unfortunately, Dr De Maria's credibility was attacked in the state parliament in a calculated attempt to undermine his findings and deflect attention from the very serious situation which he uncovered. It is my understanding that, unfortunately, the state parliament does not provide the same opportunity as the Senate in enabling those who believe they have been unfairly maligned in the chamber to put their side of the story. I wish that all parliamentary chambers in this country would do what the Senate does because it is a very necessary and important corrective, but then we lead the way on many of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hope that all senators could affirm the right of academics to speak openly about their research without having to endure attacks and dishonest efforts to undermine their credibility. Such attacks can have serious impacts on an academic's career prospects, particularly in the brave new world of tertiary education into which we have moved in recent years. Dr De Maria certainly believes that this attack on his credibility, and particularly the accusation that he falsified case studies in his research, has done his academic standing long-term damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He received extensive coverage in the media over a number of years for the research he has done in this area. His work is important and influential in looking at how we can do better to encourage and protect whistleblowers. As I said before, I believe such achievements reflect well on the University of Queensland and the social work department for which he works. I hope that tertiary institutions support their academics when they are misrepresented or unfairly attacked, particularly when they have the courage to take on politicians and governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important role which whistleblowers play has been highlighted in this Senate many times in recent years. It may seem that attention to this issue has diminished a bit in the last year or so, but I wish to assure the Senate that it is an issue which will not go away and which is as deserving of attention now as it
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ever has been. The extensive work done by people such as Dr De Maria shows that it is a serious and wide reaching issue which still requires strong action from government at all levels. I intend to build on the work of the Senate committees and other senators in this place and introduce draft legislation in an attempt to better address this crucial matter.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="3804"><TITLE>Goldmining</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak on a matter of enormous importance to thousands of Victorians. We have heard a great deal over the last few months about the need for certainty. Pastoralists, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) tells us, want to be certain that native title claims do not threaten their livelihood. Well, the Wik decision may or may not have added some uncertainty to the lives of pastoralists, but I want to say tonight that there are no pastoral leases in Victoria but there are many people who live in Victoria's central&hyphen;northern region for whom certainty is a thing of the past. I am referring to residents living in Bendigo, Eaglehawk, Kangaroo Flat, Costerfield, Dunolly and other towns who now face the prospect of living with an open cut mine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> ran a very large feature story, including a full centre page map of Victoria, which identified vast tracts of land north of the ranges where the latest technology had detected traces of gold. Much of this land was worked over during the gold rush which made Victoria so wealthy at the turn of the century. The traces which remain are very small indeed&mdash;as little as one&hyphen;tenth of a gram of gold in one to two tonnes of soil. Most of the gold was unearthed by very labour intensive mining methods, but today mining technology is of course very different. Explosives, heavy machinery and cyanide all mean that mining for extremely small amounts of gold has again become viable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mining companies have moved back into places like Bendigo and Dunolly. They have moved into parts of the town where very often mining had taken place more than a century before. Of course, the major difference now is that people have built their
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3805"> houses, raised families and settled on this land. But these people now face the future as neighbours of enormous open cut mining operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most senators will understand that a mining operation, particularly one which for five years or so uses explosives, heavy earthmoving equipment and trucks, sprays mounds of earth with cyanide and then leaves behind an enormous quarry, will not, by any stretch of the imagination, be a good neighbour. It does not matter how much consultation there is, how many public meetings are held or how many environment effects studies are conducted, one thing is for certain&mdash;an open cut mine does not a good neighbour make. The people of northern Victoria want certainty. They do not want to face the future not knowing whether or not the dust from a mine will damage their health and the health of their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Bendigo Community Health Service came out last week opposing the proposed mine at Eaglehawk. The CEO, Dee Watson, said that the mine would put the general public at risk and that dust levels would be unacceptable. The consultant who wrote the environment effects study said in the report that change to the level of dust could have  significant consequences for human respiratory systems and pose a threat to human health. As for the use of cyanide, the guidelines used in this EES relate to occupational health and safety. In other words, they relate to the risk posed by mine workers during operations. They are not applicable to the continued exposure that nearby residents will receive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people living close to the proposed mine are asking what this means for long-term exposure for them. How will it affect their small children? How will this affect the elderly living in the community? Does anyone care that many have come to this part of the world in order to retire? And what about those who have respiratory problems, many of whom choose to come to the area because of the clean air? What happens to your lungs if you live alongside and breathe in the dust day and night for five years or more? The cheapest way to move earth is to blast it out
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the ground. I ask the Senate: how many families would enjoy living alongside regular explosions day in and day out? Thousands of people in northern Victoria are expected to get used to that idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environment effects study says that noise levels will exceed EPA guidelines for some residents. I thought, like most of us, that the EPA at state level would protect us from health&hyphen;threatening intrusions of cyanide bearing dust and deafening noise. I am happy to say that the EPA's submission to the panel examining the Eaglehawk mine has at least asked for further information from Bendigo Mining. As I understand it, the EPA in Victoria also has guidelines regarding the distance one should live from a mine site. These guidelines say that mines should not be within 500 metres of houses. But in the Bendigo region some families would be separated from the mine by only the width of a road. If their children play in the street, they will share it with trucks going to and from the mine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what are the options for people for whom living alongside a mine is unacceptably dangerous? How certain can they be that the profits from an open cut mining operation will be shared around? How certain will they be of proper compensation should they decide to take their families to safer ground? The answer is that they cannot be certain at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some, but not all, residents in the Bendigo area have been offered compensation. The Mineral Resources Development Act requires the mining licensee to pay compensation for loss of amenity or any decrease in the market value of the property. So how does this work? The mining company has discretion over which, if any, residents will be offered compensation. Bendigo Mining says that it will arrange for a base valuation to be made of the property, two if the first is disputed. Some property owners, however, have already reported that these valuations are well below those used by the council to calculate municipal rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once the base valuation has been established and the mine is under way, the owner can place the property on the market. If it is sold after four months at a discount value&mdash;
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3806">say, 70 per cent below the base valuation&mdash;the mining company pays the difference or buys the property. The problem is that not only are residents forced to take the valuation that the mining company dictates but they have to go to very lengthy processes. Judging from experience elsewhere, many will have to take mining companies to appeals tribunals and to courts before any of that compensation is made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the Mineral Resources Development Act provides no real certainty either. As I understand it, none of the residents around the mine at Heathcote, for example, received any compensation from the New Holland Mining Company. Of course, even if people can sell their houses, they will not be compensated for the very considerable disruption to their daily lives. Many people now facing this prospect are deeply worried about their future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mining industry is littered with examples of mining companies going into liquidation, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. I have seen first hand the damage done to our very precious and depleted box ironbark forests in northern Victoria, the very fragile soils there and the damage to our waterways, for instance, at Dunolly by fly-by-night mining operations. I have seen farm  dams and creeks permanently damaged by mining operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have tried to put to the Senate tonight the concerns of people who face the uncertainty of living alongside mining operations. Of course, I have not even touched on the very important issue of environmental damage done by open cut mining operations, but I do ask you to consider what it would be like for communities right around Victoria to live in and around these deep scars on the countryside. What would it be like to speculate about the damage being done to waterways? What is it like to have whole slabs of public open space where birds and trees used to inhabit converted into deep quarries?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the current climate in which the dollar is  everything, such mines are not rehabilitated. The reality is that holes in the ground 40 metres deep and, in the case of Kangaroo Flat, almost a kilometre long, will be only
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> partially filled. The mining company will only be required to undertake the most minimal planting on the mounded earth around the edges. The mining companies say that to fill the hole and to return the topsoil would be too expensive&mdash;it would make the whole operation unviable. I suggest to the Senate that this kind of mining should be unviable. It should be unviable to single out these people to make them pay the very high price of scrounging that last little bit of wealth from the soil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge my fellow Victorian senators to take action on behalf of the people of Bendigo, Kangaroo Flat, Dunolly, Heathcote, Costerfield, and everywhere else where they are being asked to give up so much. The only certainty here in this part of Victoria is that we are chasing fool's gold and the people who are paying are saying that enough is enough.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="3806"><TITLE>Longford Returned Services League

The Longford RSL is proposing to bring Mr Walker before its committee for a statement he made which, in effect, was that he would like to live till he was 80&mdash;he is currently 75&mdash;so he could see the year 2001 come in in the hope that he would be standing in the same hall under a republican flag.</PARA></TALK.START>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3807">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, today in the Senate in question time, Senator Gibson asked the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, a question about interest rates. We heard from Senator Kemp about all the benefits that have arisen as a result of the supposed action of this government that has brought about low inflation, which has led to obviously lower interest rates. We have also heard the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) talk about wage restraint having some impact on that. When we were in government, we had a centralised wage fixing process and the then opposition, led by Mr Howard, used to attack us and say that we were driving families' and workers' wages down and that, under a Howard&hyphen;led government, they could only do better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is very interesting, because I noted Senator Kemp's expansive statement about small businesses and how well they were going to do under the coalition and how well they indeed were doing. Not so, it would appear, certainly according to the latest Yellow Pages survey of small business that says a number of things. One thing it definitely does say is that small business does not think it is doing well under the coalition. In fact, it thinks it is doing damned awfully. Eighty per cent of the people surveyed felt that the economy was either in recession or, at best, at a standstill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a survey of 1,200 businesses so it is not a mickey mouse survey. It is one that coalition members in opposition used many times to try to attack us when we were in government, so they seem to think that it has some relevance and, of course, some accuracy.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> future, down from 57 per cent a year ago. The survey found that only 37 per cent of business operators were aware of the Howard government's small business package, and of that 37 per cent only 22 per cent felt that there was any advantage in it for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So comments from Senator Kemp, as the Assistant Treasurer, and indeed from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) about how well small business is doing under this government ought to be looked at. We can have a look at what small businesses are doing well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say I congratulate the Treasurer for his attack on the banks. He took some time to get around to it. I find it interesting to note the comments that he made where he says, `Look, if your bank is offering you 7.2 per cent on a standard variable loan, get down to Aussie Home Loans, or get down to RAMS or Priority One.' That would be good if people could. He seems to have forgotten the fact that, when banks lend most people money, those people are locked into a period of time before they can actually pay the loan back. There are early repayment penalty clauses that, in most cases, are such that people simply cannot opt out and say, `Look, if your interest rate is too high, I am going to trot down there and get it off somebody else.' What a nonsense! If the Treasurer is really serious about doing something for consumers in respect of bringing greater and more competition into the banking system, he will do something about things like early repayment penalty clauses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To go back to this issue of small business and who is doing well, let me tell you who is doing well in terms of small business. These people have the names of Don Argus, Bob Joss and Don Mercer, and there are a few other people in the top echelons of bank management in this country. I have got to say that I do not mind people in those positions earning reasonable salaries and being paid some form of incentive. But, given the Prime Minister's statement about wage restraint and the fact that the government were totally opposed to workers getting $20 a week and they had said that $10 a week was a little bit
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3808"> on the high side, you have got people like Don Argus and Bob Joss.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to refer to Bob Joss's position in terms of his $1.9 million salary and then he has share options that will see him earn over $30 million. They are shares that he has options on, and on which he has to pay no money except that they will be exercised at $2.85 per share&mdash;and they are currently worth around $7.50.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely that is an unacceptable position. Surely it is  unacceptable that banks have $15 billion of depositors' funds, from the battlers that the Prime Minister keeps referring to, that they pay no interest on&mdash;none whatsoever. They have a further almost $80 billion&mdash;billion, not million&mdash;in term deposits that they pay less than two per cent on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government introduced legislation, with the support of the Democrats, to introduce retirement savings accounts. They are exactly the type of account that people will be forced to put their money into that will earn them no interest, or at best two per cent interest. And you expect them to be in a position to retire on those sorts of moneys. It is a joke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Staff across the four major banks&mdash;this is staff; not managers, not the top level&mdash;hold shares worth about $400 million. But senior management in the four banks hold share options worth a billion dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that I think that is totally unacceptable, particularly when you consider another issue, withholding tax. The banks are holding moneys that amount to several hundred million dollars that the courts have found the banks illegally took from borrowers, and they are still not repaying those moneys. That relates to a lot of battlers in this country, it relates to a lot of small businesses and it relates to a lot of farmers who would appreciate it very much if the government were to be serious about bringing real reforms into this banking industry. It is not enough just to make populist statements that people should get down to Priority One or some such thing. The government should really do something for people who need assistance. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Prime Minister ought

The detailed criteria used to give effect to this broad principle will be developed as part of the 1999 review.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The International Atomic Energy Agency's Standing Committee on Nuclear Liability concluded negotiations on the Supplementary Funding Convention for compensation of nuclear damage in Vienna on 11 April 1997. The meeting adopted a clean text of the draft Convention, which will be considered at a Diplomatic Conference yet to be scheduled. The major issues for discussion at the final meeting of the Standing Committee were entry into force, jurisdiction in the exclusive economic zone and the definition of damage, all of which have been resolved in a manner consistent with Australia's objectives for the negotiations. The final draft Convention includes a compensation fund dedicated to transboundary harm, and a broad definition of damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The draft Convention will supplement and enhance the provisions of the Vienna and Paris Conventions, including by increasing compensation for transboundary harm, and providing compensation for environmental damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the Vienna and Paris Conventions are based on the exclusive and strict liability of the operator of a nuclear installation, on limitation of liability in amount and in time, and on the jurisdiction of the courts of the state within whose territory the nuclear installation is situated. They provide for a minimum amount of compensation and for financial coverage through insurance or other financial security. In the event of a nuclear incident involving a nuclear power plant in the region following the entry into force of the draft Convention, if Australia and the state in which the accident  occurred were parties to the Convention and Australian interests were affected by radioactive material released as a result of the incident, Australia would be able to claim compensation for transboundary harm falling within the definition of damage outlined in the Convention. Importantly, this would include compensation for damage to the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (a) At present the only ports approved for visits by nuclear powered warships are Albany, Brisbane, Darwin, Fremantle (Gage Roads and HMAS Stirling), Hobart and Jervis Bay. Visits are only permitted by US and UK nuclear powered warships.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3812"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each of these ports has a safety plan, developed by the State/Territory Emergency Service organisations, designed to protect the public in the very unlikely event of a reactor accident. These safety plans are reviewed by the Visiting Ships Panel (Nuclear), a Commonwealth inter&hyphen;departmental committee, on a regular basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) To cover the unlikely event of a reactor accident aboard a nuclear powered warship in an Australian port, the US and UK Governments have given certain guarantees. Under United States Public Law 93&hyphen;513 it is policy to accept liability on an absolute basis for nuclear damage which results from an accident involving the reactor of a US warship. The United Kingdom has provided unilateral assurance to Australia on nuclear liability comparable to that given by the US.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) (a) During the 1950s 12 British nuclear weapon tests were conducted in Australia at the Monte Bello Islands (Western Australia) and Emu and Maralinga (South Australia). These tests resulted in measurable radioactivity over large areas of Australia. An Australian Radiation Laboratory report published in 1992, Public Health Impact of Fallout from British Nuclear Weapon Tests in Australia, 1952&hyphen;57, found the average radiation dose from nuclear test fallout to be a very small fraction of the average radiation dose from natural sources over this period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) and (c) All areas contaminated by these nuclear tests are now suitable for permanent habitation except small areas of land in the immediate vicinity of detonation sites. Detonation sites will be suitable for unrestricted occupation early in the next century with the exception of the ground zero areas of two tests in the Monte Bello Islands and the Tadje site at Maralinga. The potential hazard presented by permanent habitation at these latter sites has been addressed in site management measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1960s, the Vixen B trials at Maralinga left land close to the detonation sites seriously contaminated with plutonium. These areas are currently being rehabilitated as part of the Maralinga Rehabilitation Project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Indonesia has yet to decide whether or not to embark on a civil nuclear power program. Any future sales of uranium to Indonesia would be a commercial matter for Australian producers, subject to the necessary nuclear safeguards arrangements being in place. The Government currently has no plans to negotiate a bilateral safeguards agreement with Indonesia, and, although the proposed Nuclear Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement with Indonesia does foreshadow the possibility of future uranium transfers, it recognises that a bilateral safeguards agreement would need to be in place for such transfers to occur.</PARA>
