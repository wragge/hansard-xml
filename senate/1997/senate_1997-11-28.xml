<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all honourable senators who participated in the second reading debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . Native title is a very recent issue for most Australians. It is complex and it evokes deep emotions, because nothing is more fundamental than how we share the land, and native title is very different from other forms of Australian land tenure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's bill follows the High Court's recognition of native title rights as part of Australia's common law and passage of the 1993 Native Title Act. In 1993, we in the coalition parties thought that the act was inadequate and unworkable. It has also failed to deliver real outcomes, particularly to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. After 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> almost four years, over 660 claims, and over $210 million of taxpayer funded expenditure, the only judicial determination of native title on mainland Australia is for a small piece of land at Crescent Head in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 23 December 1996, almost 12 months ago, the High Court decided in the Wik case, by a four to three margin, that pastoral leases do not necessarily extinguish all native title. This decision relates in complex ways with the existing Native Title Act, which was simply not designed to deal properly with coexisting rights and interests in land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This interaction, and not simply the Wik decision itself, produced serious legal uncertainties. For example, the current act could mean that activities which are legal under pastoral leases or permits and essential to pastoral businesses would be impermissible if native title could be effected. The act could also effectively reverse the Wik finding that pastoral leaseholders' rights prevail over native title rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the decision has widespread implications for native title holders, for resource based industries like mining, petroleum and fishing, for pastoralists and farmers, and for governments. Leading up to the release of our 10&hyphen;point plan in May this year, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) personally spent months in detailed consultation and discussion with all these interest groups to develop a fair and balanced framework for a Commonwealth legislative response to the Wik decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister resisted widespread calls for extinguishment of native title on pastoral lease land. Instead, he proposed a fair and sensible national framework which integrates the Wik decision into Australian land law management. The Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 , based on that plan, respects and protects native title and allows claims over about 79 per cent of Australia's land area, including over pastoral leases. It also deals with workability issues arising from experience with the current act. In summary, the bill lets the Wik decision work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Few opponents of the bill appear to accept or concede that substantial deficiencies in the current act must be remedied if coexistence of native title with other interests in land is to be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9762"> accommodated in our legal system. This is because the conventional wisdom in 1993 was that native title would be found to exist in limited and remote parts of Australia, and would not be interacting with other interests. Since we now know this understanding to be wrong, the act must have a more appropriate future act regime, in particular for pastoral lease land. This is done by the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A constant refrain from the opposition is that the bill lacks a proper constitutional foundation. The government has formal constitutional advice from the Solicitor&hyphen;General that the bill is entirely supported as a special law under the constitutional races power. The government recognises that the bill's constitutional validity is likely to be challenged, probably by our political opponents, just as the native title act itself was, unsuccessfully, challenged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's firm view, supported by the opinion of the Solicitor&hyphen;General, is that the bill is not detrimental to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and is fully supported by the races power of the constitution. Political assertions about constitutionality should not prevent passage of the bill, any more than they prevented passage of the Native Title Act in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has also been alleged by some that the bill overturns the decisions of the High Court in Mabo and Wik. The government absolutely rejects these allegations. The bill adopts the very test in Wik that native title has been extinguished to the extent that native title rights and interests are inconsistent with the grant of rights and interests to lessees. It is left to the courts to assess the extent of this inconsistency. The bill does not pre&hyphen;empt these decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides&mdash;again, as the court held in Wik&mdash;that lessees rights prevail over any surviving native title rights. It implements this principle in the real world of practical primary production. I note that 81 per cent of Australians believe that farmers should be guaranteed that they can use the land they lease as needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people argue that the bill's validation provisions are not justified because government's should not have acted on the basis that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> native title was extinguished on pastoral leases. However, this assumption was supported by the High Court's decision in Mabo, by the Native Title Act itself, by the practice of the National Native Title Tribunal and by decisions of the Federal Court. It was also actively encouraged by the previous government. The coalition government believes that grants made on the basis of this legal assumption should be validated by legislation. It is just not possible to provide the necessary validity through agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill's confirmation provisions are vital to ensuring certainty in areas of Australia where, on any reasonable assessment, native title as a matter of common law has been extinguished. The act currently leaves these issues to be determined by the common law. The bill will allow the extinguishment of native title to be confirmed in line with the decisions in Mabo and Wik. The government calls on the Senate to meet its obligations to provide Australians with certainty by supporting the bill's confirmation that freehold land and other titles which clearly grant exclusive possession extinguish native title. It would be unacceptable for the parliament not to support a bill which reiterates the views of the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The schedule to the bill includes types of agricultural, residential and commercial leases which the Commonwealth and the relevant state and territories believe, on the basis of a purely legal assessment, have conferred exclusive possession and have therefore extinguished native title. The schedule does not contain one pastoral lease or other lessor interests and specifically excludes mining leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary joint committee has heard that the Commonwealth took a highly conservative approach to the development of the schedule. Some states and other interests strongly criticised the Commonwealth because certain tenures were not included. Some argue that this approach pre-empts the common law. But to leave these issues to be determined on a case by case basis by the courts would incur an enormous cost and leave enormous uncertainty. From the government's point of view, such a massive expenditure for little or no 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9763"> tangible benefit for Aboriginal people cannot be justified. Expenditure priority should be on determining claims on the 79 per cent of Australia where native title may have survived.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed primary production amendments have been widely misunderstood, as shown by some opposition contributions to the debate in the House and the Senate. The fact is that the current act contains very limited mechanisms for managing future acts on pastoral leases. The bill makes it explicit for the first time that pastoralists can carry on primary production activities on the pastoral lease and that those activities prevail. State and territory governments can continue to authorise primary production activities. State and territory governments can continue to authorise pastoralists to carry on activities outside the farm area which are directly related to primary production activities on the lease. State and territories can continue to authorise the taking of natural resources from pastoral leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These acts will be subject to the non-extinguishment principle. This means that they cannot extinguish native title rights. These provisions do not confer any additional rights on pastoralists or any other person. The management of pastoral leases remains a matter for the relevant state and territory government, as it has always been throughout Australian history. The same applies for environmental controls. It is wholly inappropriate for native title legislation to be used as a substitute for proper environmental regulation and management. Moreover, contrary to some of the grossly inaccurate reporting in the past six months, the government's amendments will not result in a windfall for foreign pastoral leaseholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For future development on pastoral leases, the government's policy is to ensure that legitimate land management needs, such as for suburban developments, public infrastructure and agricultural developments, can be accommodated. It is hoped that this can be done through agreement with native titleholders and others. The bill's guaranteed legal certainty for agreements about native title encourages this approach. There may, how 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ever, be occasions when agreements cannot be reached. The bill ensures that the only way that native title can be extinguished in the future is by agreement or through non-discriminatory compulsory acquisition, with compensation on just terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is little doubt that the Native Title Act as passed by this parliament in 1993 has caused delays in economic activity, particularly for resource development, at a significant opportunity cost for all Australians. Several senators have commented on the economic and commercial implications of the existing act's operations. The facts are these: of the 1,958 acts in Western Australia now subject to the full right to negotiate process, only 169 have been cleared for grant as at 24 October 1997. That is a clearance rate of about 8.6 per cent. The `greater than 90 per cent clearance rate' often quoted is for exploration and prospecting licences which have gone through the act's so-called expedited procedures. Under the act, these give indigenous people very little protection, unlike the provisions in our bill, which do provide that protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a 19 per cent fall-off in exploration expenditure in Queensland in the last year, which is a matter of great concern to all Australians. My understanding is that about one-third of Queensland exploration titles are being held up because of uncertainty about native title. The nation simply cannot afford this cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as ministerial intervention and the right to negotiate process is concerned, the power is constrained by very strict criteria. The minister cannot intervene in the right to negotiate process at will. There has been criticism of the bill's provisions allowing the states and territories to apply their own alternative regimes on coexisting tenures. In these areas where native title can only coexist with other interests, the government considers it inappropriate to equate native title rights with full ownership rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is widespread support for the bill's stronger legally certain agreements framework. A significant number of senators have indicated support for these provisions. Most interest groups recognise the potential for agreements to provide a lasting and workable 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9764"> resolution of native title, land use and coexistence issues at a local or regional level, either with or without government participation. Together with the bill's enhanced representative body scheme, the new agreement provisions give an attractive alternative to the more formal and adversarial processes for resolving native title related issues. There is also general agreement that the Native Title Act needs to have an effective registration test so that only meritorious claims can be registered and gain access to the very significant benefits that it provides. The bill's stronger registration test is to bring an end to the problem of overlapping and multiple claims that are dividing Aboriginal communities and deterring investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Allegations have been made that the government failed to consult on the bill and, in particular, did not negotiate its contents with indigenous groups. The government followed an open consultative process and, as far as possible, included all relevant interests in working towards the 10&hyphen;point plan. It developed the working draft bill, refined the bill for introduction into the parliament and developed the schedule of exclusive tenures attached to the bill. We had significant discussions with indigenous representatives, and the bill includes proposals put forward by them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the work of the parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund chaired by Mr Warren Entsch. The committee spent long hours hearing evidence in Canberra, Broome, Alice Springs and Cairns. The government appreciates the committee's very useful report as well as the time and effort of people and organisations around Australia in giving evidence and making submissions. The government gave serious consideration to the committee's majority report. This is reflected in amendments that we will be proposing to the bill. We also appreciate the consideration of the bill by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee chaired by my colleague Senator Eric Abetz. We acknowledge the submissions and evidence of constitutional experts. Again, there has been full government consideration of the committee's report, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as reflected in our proposed amendments to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From my perspective, the current community and parliamentary debate seems more about fiction than about the facts of the bill and its actual contents. There has been far too much misrepresentation and posturing. There are far too few who have done the hard work to understand the bill, which we see as a fair balance regarding a range of competing interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill gives effect to and implements the Wik decision. It does not involve wholesale extinguishment of native title on pastoral lease land; it meets many of the concerns of indigenous groups. The government and the parliament must balance the aspirations of indigenous people with the needs of others in the community&mdash;in particular, elected local and state governments, farmers, pastoral lessees and workers in the mining industry. The government's bill is a practicable, workable, balanced solution to the manifest deficiencies of the Native Title Act. I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The purpose of this motion is to split the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  into two bills. The first, which I understand has broad agreement and is relatively non-contentious, deals with the so-called Brandy amendments which seek to make the procedures in the Native Title Act consistent with the determination by the High Court in the Brandy case and in the sections dealing with indigenous land use agreements. The second bill, which obviously incorporates the balance of the bill 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9766"> now before us, contains measures on which there is substantial disagreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposal, which is a fall&hyphen;back position for the Greens in that we would have preferred the entire bill to be withdrawn by the government to allow for real consultation, would allow the non-contentious bill to be debated, given a third reading and sent to the House of Representatives for agreement. It would then come into effect before Christmas and not be tied up with the controversy and doubt that surrounds the balance of the government's native title bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposal is all about process. Firstly, the non-contentious aspects of the bill respond to the general concerns in both the indigenous community and the pastoral and mining industries about the processes in the Native Title Act. Honourable senators may recall that in 1993 the Greens (WA) clearly stated that the way the Native Title Act was constructed, the way it was drafted, made it very difficult to incorporate the principles of native title into the operation of other titles and other land holdings in Australia. Secondly, this proposal has been put forward for consideration by the Senate as a means of avoiding the acrimony and division that is already evident in the community about the balance of the bill. The balance of the bill can, of course, be dealt with on its merits, and it is my opinion that it does not have a great many.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is needed is proper consultation with the communities around Australia who are going to be affected by these changes to native title law in this country. I would say, quite clearly, that even those people in the pastoral industry have not had much chance to have much intimate knowledge of what the bill is about and why it is or is not necessary in parts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens have always maintained that there should be a consensus based approach to most public policy decisions. This approach is based on the belief that it is better to take the time to properly consult with those affected by public policy and reach broad based agreement than create the sort of division and disagreement that has been evident in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government's legislative response to the Wik judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Boswell stated in his speech during the second reading debate, in many cases there has been a degree of coexistence and harmony in rural communities in recent times. He seems to argue that the Wik judgment has created disharmony. The Greens would argue that it is the government's response to the Wik judgment that has created most of the disharmony. An approach in which the government determined its so-called 10-point plan in consultation with state governments and industry groups and then presented it to Aboriginal leaders largely as a fate accompli is hardly a consultative approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been too much pressure to get a quick response to deliver so-called certainty to the pastoral and mining industries. I would argue that, if this is what the government wants, it has gone about it entirely the wrong way. This bill is likely to create greater uncertainty due to its shaky legal foundations and because it has not been developed in a spirit of compromise and in a proper consultative framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposal to split the bill gives the government the best of both words. It gives them not only some amendments in procedures for native title, some improvements in procedures for native title, but also time to go away and properly consult with all stakeholders, especially Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who missed out on the first round. It is not our preferred position. Our preferred position was to withdraw the bill. That has been defeated by a Senate which seems intent at the moment on pushing through this legislation. However, I would like to see whether there is support for dealing with and progressing the relatively contentious elements of the bill and then dealing with the rest of the bill on it merits. I commend my motion to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government clearly does not support this motion, which is really all about splitting up the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . Of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9767"> course, we categorically reject the assertion that there was not sufficient consultation with all parties involved. There is a range of competing interests in an area as complex and difficult as this. In reaching a compromise, inevitably no one interest group was ever likely to achieve everything they wanted. In putting together this package, farmers have not got what they wanted, the mining industry has not got everything it wanted, nor have state and territory governments and indigenous representatives got everything they wanted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a compromise worked out over many months. It is now nearly a year since the Wik decision. It is four years since the Native Title Act came into effect. The problems with this act were and are manifest. The previous government itself introduced a bill to amend the Native Title Act some two years ago and still there have been no amendments. So this is a matter of urgency in relation to the whole nation. We believe all elements of this bill are essential and should be dealt with, and we oppose the motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition also opposes the motion, but I have to say we share the frustration of Senator Margetts and others about the legislation. It may have been a year since Wik, but I have to say that it has been a year of frustration for a lot of people with an interest in this area&mdash;particularly indigenous Australians who, unlike in Senator Minchin's assessment and appreciation, do not feel as if they have been adequately consulted. They may have had meetings with them, but they do not feel as if their voice has been heard in the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the parliament and in the opposition have agreed to the legislation going ahead through the second reading stage but, in doing so, we have made it very clear outside this place&mdash;as I make it very clear now&mdash;that we believe this legislation needs a quite comprehensive overhaul. Its implication, its overreach and its unintended consequences that go too far are for us sufficient evidence that, if this legislation goes through, it will provide an enormous mess for the system to handle. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Though the process has been rushed, though the issues are wide ranging&mdash;you can see that from the fact there are almost 700 amendments before the Senate to be discussed in the next week or few weeks&mdash;it will be an exhaustive process, but we feel we can actually proceed with the legislation at this stage. Let us see how progress goes over the next week or so. We would like to be able to give it that comprehensive overhaul that I mentioned a few seconds ago over the next few days and we will see at the end of it what evolves through this process, but I do not think we should be stalling the process at this stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hear what Senator Bolkus is saying but this is not trying to stall the debate; it is actually trying to facilitate it. As has been stated from the outset of this debate, not all of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  is bad. There are, and we acknowledge, some necessary and unavoidable amendments. Some of these have been thrust upon us due to decisions in the High Court&mdash;most notably the Brandy decision, which clarified the position of judicial power vis-a-vis the constitution and Commonwealth tribunals. This is uncontentious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other amendments have broad agreement and indeed the consent of the indigenous people. For example, the indigenous land use agreements have been drafted in large part in concert with the indigenous people. Furthermore, the notion of agreements and negotiation, rather than litigation and extinguishment, underpins what the Democrats say is the way forward for native title. People should have the opportunity to sit down and get on with coexisting. Actually, in the end, that is what it is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who have no vested interests in getting on with indigenous people have found the agreement process as an anathema to how they see the world, but there is much more at stake here. Reconciliation is dependent upon us sitting down and discussing on an equal basis our common interests and individual concerns. I really cannot understand why the government continues to almost project Aboriginal people as though they are not part 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9768"> of Australia&mdash;as though they are some separate and almost foreign group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no other option to coexistence and reconciliation if what we want is a united and harmonious Australia. The Democrats believe that the issues in this debate will be much clearer if those non-contentious general agreement areas are separated from the more abhorrent prospects in the bill. We will be supporting Senator Margetts's motion to have the bill divided and dealt with in manageable parts. We believe that clarity in the public eye will be achieved if we can separate the good parts of the bill from the attempted injustice being perpetrated by the Howard government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also support this motion moved by Senator Margetts. It is very important. There is an expectation that at the end of the day there is going to be disagreement in the Senate about the amendments to the government's <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . In short, we are going to find that the government's legislation will be amended&mdash;certainly, I hope that is the case&mdash;to the point where the government is not going to accept it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The process will be that the very much amended bill will go back to the House of Representatives and will then be sent back here. There will be disagreement between the chambers and, in effect, the government will reject the amendments. If that is the case, the whole legislation then would come back here some time next year, and there has been speculation that it may even lead to a double dissolution and an election later next year, triggered by that disagreement. The outcome of all that will be no progress as far as native title is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Margetts's motion does is says, `Let's at least get together those things which all components of the Senate agree upon and have them enacted into law to facilitate native title and to give some certainty to all parties involved coming out of the Brandy case and so on.' That is a very sensible and logical way to go. Let us at least pass the non-contentious bits into law, while the points of disputation take their course&mdash;and it may be a very long course, indeed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not understand why the Labor Party are not supporting this motion. It is entirely sensible. It is mature, good sense. It is going to help leaseholders. It is going to help indigenous people. It is going to help developers, wherever they might be. It has nothing going against it. So I do not understand why the Labor Party and, indeed, the government are not supporting it. It is almost as if it is all or nothing and we have lost sight of the ultimate goal, which is to, as best we can, facilitate the country's move towards settling this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is going to be difficult. We should be passing those components of this very complex issue upon which everybody agrees, and here is the opportunity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before we go to the first specific amendment, there is a question I would like to put to Senator Minchin. It will not take all that long, but I think it is important for us to canvass this particular issue at this stage. Senator Minchin, as you know, the Senate has already decided that the government should produce its legal advice in respect of issues 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that have been canvassed in this place, particularly as to advice that you may have received on whether the legislation breaches the Racial Discrimination Act or our international legal obligations. The time for you to produce that documentation was at 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon. I am asking you whether we should expect that documentation this morning. If so, when can the Senate expect you to comply with the order?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the government has indicated repeatedly, we are adopting the same approach adopted by you, Senator Bolkus, and now Mr Evans when in government: that legal professional privilege attaches to government legal advice. The government has received, in developing a bill of this kind, a range of legal and policy advice in addressing all the complex legal questions that it raises. We are satisfied, on the balance of the advice we have received from the range of sources, that the bill is not racially discriminatory. We are satisfied that it achieves its objectives in a non-racial discriminatory manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are adopting exactly the same approach to the relationship between the Native Title Act and the Racial Discrimination Act as you did by preserving in the bill and, therefore, in the amended act section 7(1), which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing in this Act shall affect the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The advice that is relevant, of course, is that that goes to the constitutionality of the bill. Obviously the parliament should have advice on the question of whether it is valid to pass the law, and we have released that advice from the Solicitor-General. As to the range of other advices, that will not be released in accordance with practice adopted by your government. The government is entirely satisfied that the bill is not racially discriminatory.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Minchin, you would also be aware of practice in the past which has allowed advice to, in fact, be released by government. The government has often released advice in respect of legal matters and

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I can do is repeat that the government has decided not to release any of the range of advice which it may or may not have received in considering a whole range of legal issues in the development of this bill. This bill has been developed over a range of time. We commenced this process back in January. Various stages have been dealt with and legal advices and other policy advices have been received on various stages of the bill and various issues related to the bill.

You referred to the Solicitor-General's advice or at least one of those advices. Isn't it a fact that you have, in fact, released some advice in relation to this legislation? Why won't you release this particular advice, even though you have been ordered to do so by the Senate?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said before, we believe it is relevant in the face of the constant claims that the bill may be unconstitutional. Therefore, to release the advice that goes to the constitutionality of the bill is a relevant and an appropriate question because it does go to the authority of the parliament to pass the law. That is why we have, quite properly, released the advice of the Solicitor-General, which makes it quite clear that the bill is constitutional. Although the Solicitor-General does not believe the races power requires beneficial application, the bill is of benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have released the advice of David Jackson QC, supported by Stephen Gageler, to the same effect: that the bill is constitutional. We believe that in terms of public interest debate it is appropriate, given the constant clamouring that the bill has some constitutional doubt about it, to remove that doubt by releasing the official advice of the Solicitor-General, supported by David Jackson QC, to that effect. We believe that appropriate, but we do not believe it appropriate to be dealing with the range of other advices that the government may or may not have received in relation to other issues that have arisen in developing the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to labour this point this morning and I will not go on for too long, but I think what you have done, Senator Minchin, is basically substantiated my assertion to you: that you have released some advice. You claim that constitutionality is important, and obviously it is. I suppose what I would like to know and what the public would like to know is: why don't you think that conforming with our international obligations is a sufficiently important consideration for this parliament to weigh in assessing this legislation? Why don't you think that conformity with the Racial Discrimination Act is an important consideration as well?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that you have advice from Mr Henry Burmester which covers this issue. We know that advice was given to all ministers, including the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), alerting him to the fact that Mr Burmester's advice was received. We know of that advice and we anticipate that there is other advice as well. Why do you not think it is as important for us to act in a moral and ethical way in not breaching race discrimination provisions and international legal obligations? It is important for us to act in a constitutional way, particularly when both those issues may very well be linked in any High Court consideration of the constitutionality of this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course the government takes quite seriously its international human rights obligations 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9771"> under the convention and also obviously in developing legislation that takes account of racial discrimination provisions. We have taken those matters into serious account in developing the bill and have obviously taken account of a range of advice on a whole range of issues dealing with those questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are certainly very conscious of our obligations to ensure that legislation is not racially discriminatory taken as a whole and we can hold up our heads in the international arena. We believe that Australia can do so. This nation has and is dealing humanely and properly with the obvious disadvantage that Aboriginal people suffer and our government has put a tremendous and particular focus on dealing with the particular disadvantage of Aboriginal people in relation to health, housing, education and welfare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are conscious that governments over a period of time have dedicated 15 per cent of the nation to ownership or control by Aboriginal people. We are maintaining the indigenous land fund, which will provide $45 million every year for ever to enable Aboriginal people to buy land. So we believe that Australia has a very proud record and that this bill will consolidate that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill does provide significant benefits to Aboriginal people. It continues to protect native title from its general defeasibility at common law by ensuring that in future native title can only be extinguished by agreement or by compulsory acquisition pursued in a non&hyphen;discriminatory manner and we have strengthened and reinforced the non&hyphen;discriminatory regime in relation to compulsory acquisition, because, of course, the current act already contains a compulsory acquisition regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the argument in relation to native title on this issue pertains to validation. Of course, your act quite properly contained a validation regime, and that was appropriate and proper and should have been in it. Because of the circumstances you well understand, this act contains a much stricter and more limited validation regime applying to acts on pastoral lease land in the period 1 January 1994 to 23 December 1996. That is a matter that must be dealt with. We are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> convinced that the bill taken as a whole is clearly non&hyphen;discriminatory.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not pursue this matter any further at this stage, other than to indicate that we will obviously keep on pursuing it next week. From my perspective, we can actually move on to other matters. I do not know if other senators want to pursue this at this particular stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of introduction I indicate that there have been discussions with the Greens, the Democrats and obviously with Senator Harradine. In respect of discussions with the Greens and the Democrats, we have tried to work out a way of facilitating debate here. I indicate that they will be handling these amendments in bundles. Bundles is probably the best way of doing so, because we can focus on the underlying principles related to any particular area and see how the amendments fit within them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agreement is that we may find from time to time as we address these clusters and bundles of amendments that all of us will not have to spend the allowable 15 or 20 minutes to present the case in respect of those clusters. You may find in some areas the Greens, the Democrats or the opposition will be presenting the case. We are trying to minimise prolonged debate in that respect. It is important to put that on the record at this particular stage as people might read the record at a later date.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few general remarks in that vein. We have agreed with the structure of the debate and the 21 blocks and are happy to proceed on that basis. I do want to make some general comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, as has been made evident, was always prepared to consider amendments in the lead-up to the debate of this bill which we were satisfied improved the workability of the bill and were consistent with a well thought through and considered government policy. That is why, following consideration of the two parliamentary committee inquiries into the bill, we have developed some amend 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9772"> ments of our own which we will be moving during the committee stage, and which I would trust will find acceptance from the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Generally speaking, we wish to cooperate to ensure that the bill can be dealt with by the end of next week. We will not call unnecessary divisions where it is clear which way the matter is being decided. We do want to ensure the maximum time is available for consideration of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are in number about 92 government amendments, but many of them are very technical and do not change the policy position of the bill, and therefore should not unduly take up too much time. We put out a detailed explanation of those amendments. As I say, we look forward to support from the opposition parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have to say on the record that we are in a difficult position now as a government in relation to amendments proposed by other parties. The ALP has some 350 amendments and the Democrats a similar number. We are looking forward to considering any amendments that Senator Harradine may propose and I am not sure about the Greens. We are talking about the consideration of some 800 amendments and what has been agreed to in principle is that we try to complete this by Thursday night next week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrat and opposition amendments are closely related to the indigenous working group paper on the bill and therefore have much in common. As you have said, you will be dealing with them in a joint manner, but where they diverge it becomes very complex.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our difficulty is that we introduced this bill as a final bill nearly three months ago. The draft bill, which was substantially similar, has been available for five months. We are therefore in a difficult position given that all the amendments to the bill have really only been available for about 48 hours. This is such a complex area that we are not in a position to accept amendments on the run. The former government has criticised us for not supporting certain parts of the bill or debating the bill in 1993, therefore forcing the ALP to accept amendments to get the bill through that it might not otherwise have supported. All I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> am saying is that our attitude to amendments that we have had only 48 hours to consider is that we are simply not prepared to accept amendments on the run without having had an opportunity to fully consider any unintended consequences and the workability and practicality of so many amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Native Title Act is the most substantive and significant intervention by the Commonwealth government into the land management responsibilities of states and territories in the 97 years of the Federation. Therefore, the parliament has an absolute responsibility to make very certain that the decisions it makes in this area have clear and intended consequences and are practical in relation to the land management responsibilities which go on every day all day in every state jurisdiction by democratically elected governments with the prima facie sovereign right under our constitution to manage land in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a serious look at the ALP amendments. I think they take up about 80 per cent of the Democrat amendments. I have to say there are some real problems where we have major policy differences that would take a lot more time to work through, so it is not going to be possible for us to simply accept them. Where there is doubt we will simply not be able to accept those amendments because we are not going to allow a bill to go through this parliament which has massive unintended consequences for land administration in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought it was important to set that scene in relation to our deliberation on the amendments. It is not a matter of the government being deliberately obstructionist. Given that three months after the bill was available we have 48 hours to consider 700 or 800 amendments&mdash;and we are all, I think, endeavouring to have this bill dealt with by the end of next week&mdash;I just wanted to set out the government's attitude to that practical matter.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a comment on the questions that were asked by Senator Bolkus and the answers given by the minister in relation to the legal advice that has been sought and given or not given in relation to this bill. It certainly was not a principle 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9773"> applied in terms of whether or not legal advice was provided. What seems to have been applied is a decision to selectively release those things which might just have scraped over the line in supporting the government's position. That is not a principle at all. It is not transparent. It is not solidly acting on any particular past practice. It is saying, `We will release what supports our argument. But if we seek advice and the advice says, "Wrong way, go back," we're not actually going to release that. We're going to stand behind some sort of secrecy principle that we did not actually apply to the legal advice that may just have scraped over the line in supporting our position.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite a few of us heard the Solicitor&hyphen;General's position which he put to the Senate Legal and Constitution Committee. He spent, I think, the best part of 40 minutes not giving advice. In the last minute or so he said, `Well, if you want my advice I'll say it's constitutional but my advice isn't worth much.' That is the entire basis upon which this government is operating. The minister has indicated that the Solicitor&hyphen;General has indicated that the bill is beneficial to Aboriginal people. How he would know that without actually consulting with Aboriginal people is a little difficult for me to know. I think it is a bit difficult for the minister to know as well. He said, `We believe the bill is beneficial. However, we don't believe we're going to need the bill to be beneficial to use the race power in this bill.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is one of the greatest indictments of any government that I have heard since I have been in the Senate. What it means is that they might be prepared to go to the High Court and argue that you can produce a bill which is to the detriment of indigenous Australians and argue that the race power of the Australian constitution allows you to do that.

That has been argued by a roomful of QCs or certainly a number of the Qcs who gave evidence to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no way in the world that this government will be able to pay somebody to stand up for them in the High Court and argue that the bill as it is put has the consent of indigenous Australians. If they are saying that they have got a bill which indigenous Australians are happy with, I guess they did not go outside and see the sea of hands. I guess they kept their eyes closed. They were not hearing the very strident calls to withdraw the bill. They were not hearing the very strident calls to defeat the 10&hyphen;point plan. They were not hearing. We know they were not hearing. They did not take those views into consideration. They did not even see that it was necessary to sit down and work through those differences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the clear absence of consent, for anybody from the government to say, `We believe this bill is beneficial to indigenous Australians,' is the very epitome of dangerous and discriminatory paternalism. I do not think this is good enough in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should mention that the Greens (WA) have spoken at length with members of the National Indigenous Working Group. We realise that, because they have not been taken into the consultation process, they have been put in a very difficult situation by the government. In that situation they looked at the fact that their first choice&mdash;that is, that the bill be defeated&mdash;would not be able to be achieved without the majority of the Senate backing them. Given that the majority of the Senate did not back them to defeat the bill, I guess they were left with the choice of trying to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9774"> find a compromise. The compromise has consisted of working through the bill with parties in the Senate to make, as I have mentioned before, a silk purse out of a sow's ear&mdash;that is, to try to make something that is less discriminatory and less harmful to indigenous Australians out of the legislation that has been presented to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to speak about the indigenous land use agreements, but I will not start speaking about them now because other senators may want to make initial comments before we get to look at the packages of amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on what Senator Minchin had to say about the government's ability to look at the amendments. The Australian Democrats have adopted the amendments prepared after long consultation with the indigenous working group which made a point of listening to, and indeed taking on board, the views of Aboriginal and other Australians from across the country, without the resources of a full department and without the resources of a range of draftspeople at their beck and call.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would have hoped that the government, having had the last couple of days to look through the amendments, would have realised that lots of them are similar not only to the ones that the Labor Party have now moved but also, indeed, to the amendments of the Greens, who have been working with the body that is actually out there consulting. In other words, particularly over the weekend&mdash;as today we will be largely dealing with non&hyphen;controversial amendments&mdash;the government should work to have in front of us, by the time we get to the controversial amendments on Monday, any technical problems they envisage with the amendments to be moved by this side of the chamber. While it may be necessary to burn some midnight oil, I would hope that things can be organised so that, once we get into the more difficult areas as we move through the packages of amendments, we will be able to have the government's views, and hopefully&mdash;as many of our amendments are aimed at facilitating the

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to comment on Senator Minchin's statement that the government will not be accepting amendments on the run. This is a very complex matter that we will be debating over the next week. It is inevitable that there will be amendments come up which are constructive, that people agree on, and that the government will find itself agreeing to, even if they are technical. For the minister to make a blanket statement that there will not be further amendments accepted is not to be cognisant of the way complex matters such as this inevitably lead to constructive amendments coming out of the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also chided the opposition, the Australian Democrats and the rest of us for not having produced the amendments until the last few days. But the government itself dumped 90 amendments or so on the table last night, and we have to deal with those. The government will have to deal with the amendments from this side of the place. This idea that suddenly the government will be unable to cope with the amendments that this legislation will lead to is very simplistic. The government has huge resources, including legal resources, that are not available to this side of the chamber. The government will have to deal with amendments, including amendments that arise as the next few days unfold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Minchin is really saying is that there was enormous merit in Senator Margetts's move a while ago to have those parts of the bill that we agree on pass through and that the contentious bits be put aside for further consideration as they might be a long time getting through. It would have been sensible, for example, to have allowed the contentious areas to have been looked at by the Joint Standing Committee on Native Title, or even the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, once there had been areas of general agreement established here. But the government said no to that. Now the government is saying, `And, what's more, we won't entertain any more amendments; and, what's more, we're not really prepared in committee 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9775"> to deal with the 800 or so amendments coming from elsewhere at this stage.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government needs to improve its act. The government needs to be far better prepared than that. The government needs to recognise that it has blocked the path to getting the best resolution&mdash;the consensus areas of this legislation&mdash;through. This has, therefore, led to the Senate in committee having to deal with all these amendments in the next week. For the government to flag up&hyphen;front that it has got too hard&mdash;that it cannot deal with more amendments, that it is distressed by the fact that the Labor Party, the Greens and the Democrats, and potentially Senator Harradine, have a different point of view and that the government is going to have to analyse that different point of view&mdash;is not good enough.</PARA></SPEECH>

But, while the question before the chair is that the bill be agreed to, I should take the opportunity to correct a statement that was made recently and also to put some material before the committee which shows the importance of the bill being agreed to in the form in which it is at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Tuesday this week, Mr Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister, told ABC television that Mr Pearson, the Chairman of the Cape York Land Council, was signatory to an ambit claim over several leasehold properties on Cape York Peninsula. At the time, Mr Fischer was of the belief that these leases were `in transition'&mdash;I think that was the phrase used. Mr Pearson denied this and, in an article by Michael Gordon and Georgina Windsor which appeared in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, Mr Pearson said: `We have deliberately followed a policy of not claiming current pastoral leases in Cape York since 1993.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to correct some misapprehensions about the situation. On 9 October 1997 the Cape York Land Council put out a press release and a media brief relating to a particular claim by the Wuthathi people. In the media brief the Cape York Land Council said, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> `The claim will be lodged at the National Native Title Tribunal in Brisbane today and covers the occupational licence and pastoral lease in the area.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have a copy of the claim, as lodged with the Native Title Tribunal. It clearly identifies the occupational licence and the lease, and they are current tenures. The pastoral lease in question does not come up for renewal until next year. It is quite ironic that, because the post can be a bit slow from Cape York Peninsula, the leaseholders, Mr and Mrs Nixon, asked me in September to take their application for the renewal of the lease down to the office of the Queensland Minister for Natural Resources in Brisbane. The application was made before this claim was put on the property. The occupational licence is automatically renewed annually, provided that the lessees are using the lease and that the lease is current.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Inquiries this morning with Mr and Mrs Nixon indicate that the lease covers some 49,800 hectares. They mustered over 1,000 head of cattle in August, so they are using the land quite profitably. It is a current operation, and it is incorrect for anybody to form the belief that the Cape York Land Council is following a policy of not claiming pastoral leases. In fact, they made a claim over a pastoral lease on 9 October. It was specifically over this pastoral lease and the occupational licence that was attached. It follows, therefore, that it is very important that the legislation which ensures that these leasehold interests are safe is passed. I will explain why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has always been the contention of the Cape York Land Council and Father Frank Brennan that, when a lease comes up for renewal, it is vacant crown land and, therefore, should revert to native title. That is what it is about. Even when the other side were in government they did not share that view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put these matters on the record, and I seek the leave of the Senate to table the following documents: the media alert of the Cape York Land Council; the media briefing; the extract from the register of native title claims, accompanied by two maps; the internal historical state tenure search which was attached to that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9776"> claim; and two newspaper clippings covering the claim itself.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know Senator Harradine wants to say a few words, but I have to say a couple of things in respect of this. This could be a very long debate if we are going to go into this sort of rhetoric and misinformation around the chamber. We do not need to do that, and it is not the intention of the opposition to run this sort of debate. We will resist provocation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I will do at this stage is also put on the record that when the Cape York Land Council checked the register in respect of the subject areas they found that the register of the state of Queensland showed that each of the leases in the Kalpowar holdings region had been cancelled. They checked it again quite recently, and the searchers confirmed that the area in question was unallocated state land. The description of the land in the application was one made for convenience only. That has been pretty widely promulgated by the Cape York Land Council as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the assertion in respect of seeking exclusive possession, I think it is fair to say that, if one was to look at the claim itself and look at all aspects of the claim, one would see that the claim, in the normal form these claims are made in, included the phrase `save for the valid operation of the laws of the Commonwealth in the state of Queensland'. Therefore, it is accepted by the claimants that native title yields to the rights held by others under valid Australian law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, we do not need to get into this sort of rhetoric and misinformation. I could talk at length. I do not want to go on at length. I just want to correct the record for this moment. I hope we can move on to a more constructive process of debating.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the applications claims process and sunset clause; the registration test; and representative bodies&mdash;which are probably the least contentious of the matters contained in the legislation. That will give us an opportunity to settle down after the last few days of debate. The debate has been quite good at times but acrimonious sometimes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to respond to Senator Minchin. I indicate to him, and to other honourable senators, that I will have some amendments. Honourable senators around the chamber will know that there are substantial difficulties in getting amendments up to scratch. The first difficulty is actually being in a position to give drafting instructions. The reason for that is obvious: I was not privy to what the Labor Party was going to do. It eventually made up its mind earlier this week. I received a copy of the draft amendments two days ago, I think.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, I had to wait until I saw those amendments to decide whether I thought they were entirely satisfactory in terms of my view on this particular matter. Thanks to the National Indigenous Working Group, a week or so ago I had a draft document of the way it was going. That was very useful. Yesterday, I received the final draft of what is being proposed by the group in amendment form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After consultations yesterday evening, I was able to give drafting instructions. The Senate drafting services of the Procedure Office have been working very late into the night and early this morning on those particular matters. I am most grateful for the resources of this place. We have tremendous resources in the Parliamentary Library. The resources that I have been able to access through the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund have been absolutely excellent. I put that on the record here and now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the information of senators, I indicate that I will probably have 21 amendments. As far as today is concerned, I have a mere three or four. Hopefully, they should be circulated in the chamber within the next half&hyphen;hour.

<PARA STYLE="Para">These deal with indigenous land use agreements. It is at least a positive sign that we are starting off the debate with particular amendments in an area where by and large there is certain agreement that the amendment of the act is required and would be of considerable benefit to all land users, most particularly native title holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government believes that the provisions in the bill in relation to indigenous land use agreements have been well thought through, well constructed and properly balanced. There is the need for legal certainty in relation to agreements without unduly requiring or granting to indigenous land councils any monopoly over the process. We think we have struck the right balance in our proposals in relation to the position of native title claimants and holders vis-a-vis land councils. We think it is appropriate that land councils have a role. Having discussed this in great detail with indigenous people, we are reluctant to give land councils anything that might resemble a monopoly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 15 relates to paragraph 24BB(a), which states that a body corporate agreement may provide for, among other things, the doing of a future act subject to conditions contained in the agreement. This amendment simply makes it clear that these conditions may be about procedural matters. So it is clear that the parties to the agreement can agree to impose procedural requirements in relation to the doing of future acts. We think it is an appropriate and sensible amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No. 16 goes to proposed paragraph 24CB(a). That paragraph states that an area agreement may provide for, amongst other 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> things, the doing of a future act subject to conditions contained in the agreement. Again, it relates to being able to agree on procedural matters. It is obviously a sensible thing that the parties should be able to agree on. There should be no unintentional restriction on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 17 goes to proposed section 24CK. That section sets out the conditions for the registration of an area agreement certified by the relevant representative body. The amendment inserts a new subsection (4), which sets out the information to which the registrar must have regard in deciding whether he or she is satisfied, as mentioned in paragraph 24CK(2)(c). The amendment will provide for the registrar to take into account information given by the persons objecting against the registration of the agreement and the representative body that certified the application. The amendment provides that the registrar may, but need not, take into account any other matter or thing. We think that is appropriate. You have to have some objection mechanism to ensure that an agreement is fair and balanced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 18 goes to proposed paragraph 24DB(a), which provides that an alternative procedure agreement may provide for, amongst other things, the doing of a future act subject to conditions contained in the agreement. This is again to ensure that procedural matters can be included in the agreement. They are technical amendments, but we think they improve the agreements process. Therefore, they should be acceptable to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The indigenous land use agreements provisions in the existing act do not support agreements that will bind all native title holders unless there has been a determination from the court that native title exists and which identifies the group that holds it. Very often, parties can agree on issues such as how the land should be managed&mdash;access, compensation, et cetera&mdash;but not whether native title exists. It is, therefore, essential that there is a simple means of allowing parties to reach binding agreements without all parties being put to the expense and delay of protracted legal proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Agreements are voluntary and there will be no compulsion for parties to enter into them. The agreements provide an option to all parties in the event that there is some common ground. The more flexible this process is, having regard to the need to ensure safeguards against abuse, the more likely it is that conflicts can be resolved in a spirit of coexistence rather than the legal equivalent of trench warfare. Part of the problem with putting in a rigid system would be that the nature of the relationship between people through all sectors and the differences between areas cannot be taken into consideration in the way agreements are formed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is essential that agreements should be possible without the necessity to lodge a claim. Once the claim process is started, it is actually difficult and expensive for any party to control. Long after the agreement is signed, parties may find that they still have proceedings on foot. The considerations which go into the making of a claim are often more complex, and therefore more time&hyphen;consuming and expensive, than reaching an agreement, particularly where the impact on the land of any acts authorised by the agreement are likely to be limited. This is unnecessary and should be avoided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An agreements process should be flexible enough to deal with small&hyphen;scale projects on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9782"> identified parcels of land; large&hyphen;scale projects that may traverse several states, such as a railway or a super highway; agreements that cover minor repeat acts such as road widenings where the right to negotiate may apply, but where more appropriate alternative procedures can be agreed; new native title issues that may emerge as the common law develops, such as rights to marine and mineral resources, without the need to constantly refer the legislation back to the parliament; and validation with proper and full consultation of invalid acts which have either already occurred or which may occur in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the amendments formulated in conjunction with the National Indigenous Working Group in consultation with the Greens, the Democrats and the Australian Labor Party achieve these objectives. I am happy to mention other particular provisions here. The explanation from the National Indigenous Working Group is that the indigenous land use provisions are largely satisfactory in content as they stand but, to ensure that the indigenous land use agreements can also be used to validate past acts and intermediate acts periods, their scope must be extended and the provisions removed from part 2, division 3 which deals only with future acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the combined amendments there is some tightening up, shining up and improving of the provisions. It has been widely acknowledged that these are legal provisions which will move towards a better outcome for all parties involved. Amendments Nos 21 to 23 and 26 to 28 are consequential amendments on the extension of indigenous land use agreements to cover more than future acts. Amendment 24 relates to registered native title body corporates, which will place upon those bodies an obligation to consult with the relevant representative body prior to entering into an indigenous land use agreement&mdash;a similar provision currently exists in the native title regulations. Amendment 29 relates to area agreements, including the same consultation requirement with the relevant representative body as provided in amendment 24. Amendment 35 prevents the registrar from registering an agreement where the relevant 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> representative body has advised that it was not consulted as required, as in amendment 24. Amendment 31 deletes the government's proposed section 24CG(3) and substitutes the requirement that an application for registration must be certified by all relevant representative bodies, that reasonable efforts have been made to identify all affected native title holders, that each of those persons has had a reasonable opportunity to be consulted and that consultation with the relevant representative bodies has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments 30, 34 and 37 are consequential amendments requiring all area agreements to be certified. Amendments 32, 33, 36 and 44 are consequential on the representative body agreements. Amendment 35 requires the registrar to register an agreement only if the agreement is consistent with any relevant alternative procedure agreement which has previously been registered. Amendments 38 to 43 and 45 and 46 are consequential on the extension of the indigenous land use agreements to cover more than future acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 47 promotes the use of indigenous land use agreements to signify the primary role it is hoped that they will play in the resolution of native title issues. This amendment relocates the provision relating to indigenous land use agreements to the front of the act. This will also ensure that the provisions apply to the resolution of native title issues generally and not just for future acts. Amendment 48 inserts a title and overview of the division relating to indigenous land use agreements. I commend the amendments to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These amendments moved by Senator Margetts are co&hyphen;sponsored by the Democrats and others on behalf of the National Indigenous Working Group. The Democrats believe that the government has missed entirely the essence of what native title can be. We believe at its heart that native title is about including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the future of the nation. Let us be quite clear about this. Until the Mabo decision, the only way indigenous people were included was through acts of paternalism and a welfare mentality. I do not think I will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9783"> repeat the history of the Queensland government that I gave the other night, but, if ever there is an example of that or if ever you want any illustration of it, I can always do that again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The indigenous land use agreements give us the opportunity to put that past of paternalism and sometimes outright racism behind us. No area of contention or conflict in human society is ever in the long term worked out by endless recourse to the courts, nor is it worked out by having the rights of some people put asunder to those who have more power, more money and more clout. That is not what living in a civilised and humane society which is respectful of difference and celebratory of diversity and multiculturalism is about. The amendments to the indigenous land use agreements facilitate an improvement of the regime and an encouragement for all stock holders to sit down and coexist, share and reconcile with indigenous Australia. The Australian Democrats will be supporting these amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While the government has given serious consideration to these amendments, we believe on balance that with the structure we have formulated, taking careful consideration of the propositions put to us by the Indigenous Working Group and ATSIC and other Aboriginal interests, we are not on balance able to accept these opposition and Democrat amendments. The first block of amendments really relates to extending the cover of indigenous land use agreements to acts occurring before the Wik decision on 23 December 1996. In other words, they seek to extend the scope of these agreements beyond future acts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not think that that is at all appropriate because past acts, that is, acts that occurred prior to the commencement of the Native Title Act on 1 January 1994, have all been validated by the 1993 act and the current ILUA provisions are already wide enough to cover agreements about compensation for those acts. The concept of validation of intermediate period acts by agreement is not acceptable to us. Essentially, it means that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> validation can only occur by agreement and, if that is the case, then effectively it leaves a veto. I do not want to be accused of abusing the term `veto' but, obviously, if something cannot occur unless there is agreement then, by definition, if there is no agreement it cannot occur and that means that the party to the agreement has  a veto. In this case, what you are saying is that, if the relevant native title parties do not agree, they have a veto over validation and to leave that validity question entirely dependent on that agreement is simply unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next block of amendments&mdash;24, 25, 30, 34, 37 and 31&mdash;go to the question of certification of area agreements. Effectively, they require that area agreements have to be certified by representative bodies and touch on the obligation to consult representative bodies. Whatever you may say, Senator Margetts, I certainly have spent much of the last 20 months travelling Australia talking to a range of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups and communities and one thing that you become very conscious of is that the position of land councils&mdash;and they are representative bodies&mdash;is a controversial one within Aboriginal communities. I have heard more invective directed towards land councils from Aboriginal people than from any other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our total bill, we are seeking to give representative bodies a critical role in the process. We do generally support&mdash;and I think you would accept that our amendments do enhance&mdash;the role of representative bodies in ways recommended by the report which the previous government commissioned. but based on the judgment we formed after discussions with a whole range of Aboriginal interests, we do not believe we should do anything to give a monopoly in relation to agreements to representative bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do believe that, as a result of our amendments, native title holders will be encouraged to use the services of representative bodies, and that is what they are there for. We believe in funding them well, in establishing them well and making them accountable, democratic and representative to ensure that they can provide a very profes 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9784"> sional service to native title holders. I do not wish to be disrespectful, but the National Indigenous Working Group is basically made up of land councils and they would have a vested interest, obviously, in seeking to acquire such a monopoly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What matters here is the native title holders themselves, and they are not necessarily, by definition, going to have exactly the same interests as a representative body. It is fine to have the representative bodies well serviced, as I say, and well funded to provide a facilitating role, a professional service, for native title holders but, at the end of the day, native title holders, in our view, should retain the capacity to choose to deal directly with other parties in reaching agreements rather than be forced to do so through a representative body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have facilitated and encouraged, as I say, the use of representative bodies but, at the end of the day, the content of agreements should be a matter for the parties. Representative bodies are there to assist native title holders, not to determine the contents of agreements. So we are, therefore, not able to accept those amendments, although I appreciate the intention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not satisfied that amendment No. 35&mdash;registration of area agreements only if consistent with alternative procedure agreement&mdash;is absolutely necessary. We would presume the parties to the area agreement would be bound to act consistently with the provisions in any event. So, on balance, we are not clear that is a necessary amendment. Amendments Nos 32, 33, 36 and 44 relate to the issue of representative body transitionals and, based on our view on that issue, we cannot accept these amendments because we do not accept the premise on which they are based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opposition amendments Nos 47, 48, 193 and 196 really bring about a move of the ILUA provisions in a positional sense in the bill to put them before the future act regime, and that relates to the proposition that ILUAs cover the validation of past and immediate acts. Therefore, it is inconsistent with our restructuring of the act under our amendments to bring all provisions relating to future acts into the same division so that it is much 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> clearer and easier to understand how the bill is working. As I say, our whole premise is that agreements relate to the doing of future acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, amendments Nos 194 and 195 are about the removal from the register of agreements, and our legal advice is that what is proposed here does have some problems. It is not clear to us what qualification, if any, the proposed subsection 199C(4) would put on the concept already in 199C(3) of `being induced to enter into the agreement by reasons of fraud, undue influence or duress'. As a matter of law, fraud or duress do negate any agreement since they render consent to the agreement invalid. If the proposed subsection had the effect of allowing some improperly induced agreements to stand, that would clearly be a departure from general legal principles applying to contract agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment is a limitation on the capacity of the Federal Court to remove an agreement from the register if persons who are later determined to hold native title would not have authorised the agreement. Therefore, on balance, and given the legal advice on the operation of this, we are not able to accept it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just respond to some of the points. It is a bit unfortunate that Senator Minchin has not been able to accept some of these amendments because we think that they are important and would facilitate what, I suppose, Wik was all about. Wik was all about coexistence. The best way to ensure coexistence is by agreement, and the best way to do that is to apply a capacity to have agreements in the act to as wide a range as possible. So when Senator Minchin says that he wants them to apply only to a certain range, not to other areas as we recommend&mdash;the intermediate act regime and also past acts&mdash;it is unfortunate that he has not seen fit to embrace these amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who might have been anticipating a bit of fireworks this morning will be disappointed. We are actually already into what one journalist this morning called `the driest mechanical exercise in law making', and I think that is why we have got right into it very quickly. I thank David Marr for that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9785"> comment. We are into some technical points, but the technical points have some important ramifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best way to apply ILUAs is to ensure that they can have as wide a scope as possible. Let us face it: agreements at the appropriate time and as early as possible have enormous benefits, benefits that you cannot buy through a court process or a tribunal process. They not only provide certainty but also can define very early in the piece the relationship between the parties and can engender a great degree of goodwill that you would not get out of a court process. They provide a framework. They provide an ongoing good relationship. They can define roles. They can allow people to control the outcome without having to spend enormous resources. To that extent, we are very keen to ensure that they can be used as widely as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin said that, if we were to apply them to be available to validate past acts or intermediate acts, it would ensure that the claimants would have a right of veto. That is a misunderstanding of the position that we are putting up. The position that we are putting up is that a capacity to use the ILUA provisions of the bill should be made as an alternative to whatever this parliament decides on as the validating regime. We are not saying it has to go down the agreement route. It is an alternative that is available to parties. It could very well be available to and used by parties quite beneficially if they had the capacity to pursue the agreement route as opposed to the form of validation route that this parliament might finally decide on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us make it available to them. There is no downside to that. Parties do not have to use it, but parties in their good sense may actually see that to ensure that issues do not continue to fester, to ensure that the common law is not utilised, they could actually have this route available. I suggest to Senator Minchin that he may have some misunderstanding of what we are trying to do here. We are not prescribing it for all occasions; we are making it available as an alternative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the area agreement argument, you have concerns with rep bodies having a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> role and you say there is community concern about rep bodies, but your own bill recognises the importance of them and the vital role that rep bodies can play in the process. For instance, clause 24CK of the bill provides for certification of agreements by rep bodies. You acknowledge their role there. Clause 24CL(3) and 24CL(4) of the bill require the registrar to consider any information relating to the identity and authority of native title holders provided by a rep body in the registration process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So let us face it: the rep bodies are important in the process. What we say is why allow them a role later down the track, when to put them in the play earlier in the development of area agreements could be quite fundamental to a cohesive outcome? We have to also take into account the people we are talking about here. Let us acknowledge that there is a massive imbalance between individual or small groups of indigenous Australians and the people they are negotiating with, who have big resources, access to lawyers, access to accountants and access to all sorts of facilities. It is important for those individual indigenous Australians to be able to have access to advice. Obviously, if they had the resources, they could go out and buy legal advice, but if they do not the rep bodies could quite validly provide for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not talking about continuation of the rep bodies as they currently exist in some areas, because we are all agreed on reforms to the rep body process and we will come to that later. But it is important for equity reasons that rep bodies have the capacity to play a role in the formulation of area agreements and protecting native title claimants but also assisting the process. The government acknowledges their importance in some areas. Let us take a real equitable approach to this and ensure that they do have a capacity to play a role in respect of area agreements as well.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As was mentioned by Senator Bolkus, there is an option in relation to the use of indigenous land use agreements&mdash;and they are called agreements. There is really no point in having a situation where one group 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9786"> or individuals can be picked off, if you like, by those people who have the corporate expertise, legal advice and so on, so other people feel they are forced into an agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an option. It is something that is favoured by many groups and it is not unreasonable to suggest it should actually be an agreement. It should be a consensual agreement. That does mean leaving people with the ability to get together and form something that everybody is happy with. I do not think that is so onerous and I do not think it would be considered inappropriate in business. I really do not know why it is considered by Senator Minchin or the government to be inappropriate in relation to what is supposed to be not only something that gets ticked off and signed off but something that all parties can work with and continue to work with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is absolutely important that that is a consensual agreement process. Yes, it is true that, if somebody is not happy, that part of the agreement will not be registered. But what is the point of having people who continue to be unhappy signing on to something? It is supposed to be the safety valve in this whole process, to avoid the unhappiness or legal battles that can be avoided.

There are also corporations which are in the process of trying to manage land rights claims which have very few resources at all, and there are all sorts of reasons for that, including inadequate funding for ATSIC.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could speak for a long time on this particular issue, but we are going to come to the issue of rep bodies later. One of the problems for representative bodies has been the lack of resources. That is one of the reasons why the problems have arisen. Of course, native title holders, individual Aboriginal people and ATSIC at different times have got quite angry about representative bodies. One reason for that&mdash;not the only reason, but one of the reasons&mdash;is that the lack of resources has meant the representative bodies have not been able to fulfil the functions that are expected of them. That is one of the fundamental reasons why we have had problems with representative bodies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What these amendments are trying to do is make indigenous land use agreements really work to give people alternatives. If we do not do this, we will have problems, and let me tell you about some of the problems which are already arising. A problem they are having in many areas is between those who are now termed traditional people and those who are termed historical people&mdash;particularly in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just give you some examples. For instance, there are people who live at Mapoon who can trace back their ancestry for many generations&mdash;they are the traditional people. However, there are also people who were brought there. Perhaps their parents, grand 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9787"> parents or great&hyphen;grandparents were transferred from other communities and dumped in Mapoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a policy for many years of different Queensland governments. What happened, of course, was that after two or three generations of living there, these people regarded themselves as residents and as people from Mapoon. There is a conflict between these people, who may only have two or three generations of residency, and the traditional people who have many generations of residency in Mapoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Cape York Land Council has had great difficulty in sorting out the claims of those two groups of Aboriginal people. What we are saying is that we have to give maximum flexibility, in terms of indigenous land use agreements, so that not only conflicts between pastoralists or miners and Aboriginal people but also conflicts between different native title claimants can be resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What these amendments would do is give the possibility of maximum flexibility. I could talk about many other communities where the same problem has surfaced in different ways. I would certainly add my appeal to that of Senator Bolkus and Senator Margetts that the government support these propositions.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also have a question for the minister while he is on his feet. I heard what Senator Margetts said about the ILUAs operating in tandem with the validation provisions, but, of course, I am aware also of what is being proposed in respect of the latter by the Greens and the Democrats. The validation question is neither&mdash;to put it mildly&mdash;entirely in line with the bill nor in line with the opposition amendments relating to that. The question in my mind, which will need to be answered by the minister, is whether or not the ILUAs are able 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to operate instead of, or in association with, the validation procedures. Senator Bolkus might respond so far as his amendments on validation procedures are concerned. I hope that the minister will also respond.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can answer that question from my perspective while the minister formulates his response. We actually see that these ILUA provisions can sit with whatever validation provisions get through the Senate, whether it is the government's or the opposition's. They are provided as an alternative. With respect to validated acts, you could say, `Where would having this capacity be of any use if, for instance, the government's provisions got through or even if the opposition's provisions got through?'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see it as an opportunity, an avenue that is available. It is not enforced in any way. It is an alternative that is available to people. There will obviously be disputes in any validation regime. Those disputes can be handled either under the act or through the common law. We say that we should also make available to claimants and parties to any dispute a capacity to use the agreements provisions as well, if they so seek, to provide extra certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From our perspective, there is no good reason as to why you should not make this provision available in the interests of certainty, no matter what regime you pick up. As we have seen more and more in recent weeks, parties are coming to regional agreements, area agreements and site specific agreements. I think you will probably find that the practice of some industry sectors is to go down this road rather than go down the road which may give some immediate satisfaction but may not give the longer term certainty that they need. That is why we say we should make it available and then the parties have a choice whether they pick it up. It will not, in any way, impinge on any aspect of either our validation regime or the government's.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have thought that, given the scope and depth of our amendments in relation to agreements, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9788"> the parliament would accept our bona fides in strongly supporting the agreements process. In relation to rep bodies, we have given them a substantial role in the process without the ultimate power of monopoly. In relation to resources, the federal government, through ATSIC, is funding representative bodies around the country to the tune of $40 million per annum&mdash;that is an increase from $25 million when the act first came into effect. Forty million dollars is, in my terms, a sizeable amount of money. Obviously, every organisation in Australia would like more money, but $40 million is not a small sum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we should make clear the more substantive question that has been raised about agreements. Obviously, in general terms, agreements relate to the doing of future acts. Let us agree on who can do what, when, where and under what conditions. That is the whole point of an agreements mechanism. The agreements mechanism in the act is designed to give parties the option to come to agreements about the doing of future acts on land on which native title may have survived, without going through all the other future act processes of the Native Title Act. They can agree among themselves to the way in which the future act shall be done and then ensure, by that agreement being registered, that the future act is valid. Otherwise you have to go through all the future act regime, and that is one of the deficiencies of the current act. That is obviously a good thing, and we all agree on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to Senator Cooney, there is nothing to stop parties agreeing, either under this act or by a common law agreement, on the doing of anything in relation to past acts&mdash;past acts being some sort of tenement that has been issued in the past&mdash;and parties then agreeing as to how future activity in relation to that past act is conducted. We do not and cannot accept a proposition that the validity of a past act can be dependent upon an agreement. This may be a point of departure, but it is one in which we feel quite strongly. We do think it is essential for legal certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the parties being issued with tenements and leases in good faith&mdash;having, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in many cases, probably invested millions of dollars and employed hundreds of people in these projects&mdash;legal certainty must be granted by way of a validation regime, as the parliament validated everything done prior to the commencement of the Native Title Act. So in the circumstances, but in a more limited way, our validation regime will provide for the validation of acts that occurred on pastoral leases in that 1994 to 1996 period. So they have to be validated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parties can subsequently come to agreement about the doing of things in relation to those validated past acts. There is absolutely nothing in our agreements mechanism which prevents that at all. All we are saying is that there is no need to amend our amendments or accept these amendments proposed by the other parties to enable that to occur. We are simply not going to support any proposition that some past acts will have their validation dependent upon agreement being reached, because that is to say that, if agreement is not reached, the act remains invalid. That is simply not acceptable to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I hope I have made clear what we are coming to. I guess it does flow from perhaps some differences of opinion about the scope of the validation regime. If you accept, rightly or wrongly, that these titles were issued in good faith by governments that had a clear understanding of the law in relation to the status of pastoral leases&mdash;and, whether we like it or not, those have all been issued and investments have been made in relation to them and people have been employed&mdash;we think the validation is essential. Therefore, the agreements provisions can operate and can deal with anything that the parties want to agree with in relation to those validated acts, but we cannot accept any proposition that validation itself is subject to, or dependent upon, agreement.</PARA>

Is that still your view?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Chair, we appear to be redebating something which has been voted on. If we are going to redebate amendments which have been settled and determined, we will be here until the Christmas after next. As a premise, procedurally, it will be very difficult if we redebate everything we have voted on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our point was, and I state it again, in relation to indigenous land use agreements and their legal effect, we are saying that we cannot accept amendments that are premised on the basis that there will not be a full validation of intermediate past acts. The presumption in your amendments is that there will not be a full validation regime so, if you accept the premise that there is a full validation regime, your amendments contradict that proposition. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9792">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your amendments are founded on a proposition with which we cannot agree. Agreements are about giving legal validity to the doing of certain things that otherwise would be invalid and otherwise have to go through the future act regime. If you validate past acts, they are valid, and there is no question of an agreement being necessary to ensure their validity. It does not mean that the parties cannot come to agreements, either inside or outside the act, about matters relating to the exercise of rights under the validated act. There is nothing in our amendments which prevent that occurring at all. I think that may be where the misunderstanding is. So the agreements can fully operate in relation to those validated past acts.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our point was that our agreements regime is entirely comprehensive and is essentially designed, of course, to deal with future acts, but the whole provision is premised on the basis that agreements can be reached about the doing of past acts that have been validated. Therefore, there is a completely contrary premise to our position in relation to this section of your amendments which are, by your definition, premised on the option or need for agreements to lead to validation. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> That is what I am saying: your amendments are only there because you are not intending to provide, in our view, a proper validation regime, and therefore we cannot accept them. As I said, we are debating something we have already voted on.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not doing that because we still have before us the question of area agreements, and ILUAs can be seen to be quite relevant in respect of those, so I do not think we have fully concluded the discussion about the extension of ILUAs to cover intermediate period and past acts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I want to clarify, which I do not think Senator Minchin has yet answered, is what the legal impact of extending the capacity this bill provides for the use of ILUAs to cover intermediate period and past acts is. Would an extension of this access to ILUAs impinge in any way on any validation regime that goes through this House? My contention is that it would not. Whether Senator Minchin's validation regime or the opposition's validation regime goes through this House, that regime will provide the degree of certainty the parliament finally decides in respect of a regime that will be, in a sense, compulsory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Putting aside the metaphysics about whether something can sit easily with something else, my contention also is that making available the use of ILUAs, as is provided by this legislation, would in no way impinge on that validation regime that passes this parliament. The reason we still pursue it is that we still think that having access to those ILUA provisions can provide for parties that come to an agreement a very ready recourse which will be beneficial for all concerned in respect of being able to give effect to those ILUAs under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern is that the parliament has not been given correct advice about the impact of the opposition's amendments in regard to ILUAs. My concern is that the parliament was misled, to the effect that, if we were to adopt provisions that extended the capacity to use ILUAs, as proposed, then somehow the legal effect of that would be to undermine the validation regime passed by this parliament. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9793"> That is why we continue to raise this. We are still talking about area agreements, and that is still a live issue, if we want to contain the debate to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I want to establish clearly, for the sake of the record that, were we to adopt an extension of ILUAs to cover intermediate period acts and past acts, such an extension would not have any legal impact at all and would in no way undermine your validation regime, if that were to get through, or ours, if that were to get through. If none got through, that would be another thing. But explain in what way adoption of that extension would have legal impact on your validation regime.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I am repeating myself again. Your amendments are only necessary because you are not prepared to ensure the validation of all intermediate past acts that need to be validated. What you are really saying is that, without this, there is a problem with the validation regime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We regard the provision as utterly unnecessary. Agreements can be reached about anything to do with a validated past act. There is nothing in our agreements that prevents that occurring, so I reject the accusation that I  have somehow misled you or the parliament. That is nonsense. What we are saying is that there is nothing in our amendments that prevents agreements being reached in relation to the doing of things that are triggered by or necessitated by or that players wish to agree about in relation to validated past acts. But, to the extent that you are later going to propose that validation is much more limited than we believe is absolutely necessary to ensure legal certainty, we oppose your amendments. It has been voted on, and we are going over old ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because it has to be procedurally taken out and dealt with separately, the next subject is amendment 37 to delete the certification area&mdash;registration of agreements not certified by rep bodies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister has still refused to confirm that there would be any legal impact. I do understand why you are doing that, because there will not be any legal impact. There will not in any way be any legal undermining of either the government's or the opposition's validation regime. You know that extremely well. You also know that ILUAs do not only have to deal with validation. They can deal with compensation issues as well, after validation. That is why we think it is also important to be able to apply ILUAs under this act to cover past acts and intermediate period acts as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern is that we have been misled. You say people can also go off and agree about whatever they want to agree about. In practice that is right. But your act provides under 24BB on page 21 that indigenous land use agreements, ILUAs, under this act must be about one or more of the following matters in relation to an area:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the doing, or the doing subject to conditions, of particular future acts, or future acts included in classes;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You are limiting it to future acts. We are saying that ILUAs registrable under this bill, with force under this bill, can also have a very useful role to play with respect to past acts and intermediate period acts. We say that because they can provide not just a compensation regime but they can provide a very healthy alternative to a validation regime which people may want to contest, and they could contest it at common law. The bottom line is that, were we to extend the capacity for ILUAs under this act to include intermediate period acts and past acts, there would be no legal undermining of your validation regime or ours. I would like you to acknowledge that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">So you need to read the whole section before you start commenting on what it is restricted to. That clearly means that they can agree on anything relating to a past validated act and its impact on native title rights and interests. You also seem to be unaware that our agreement provisions clearly contemplate and allow for agreements about compensation in relation to past validated acts. So our agreement provisions are comprehensive and complete. We are not going to fall for the problem that the previous government did in 1993 where you had an act which you rendered full of clauses with unintended consequences. We believe, as the Senate has now already voted, that the agreements provisions are comprehensive and complete and enable the doing of agreements in relation to future acts and in relation to anything to do with past acts that have been validated as well as compensation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just before the lunch break, I suppose you could call it, we were discussing the capacity of people who enter into indigenous land use agreements under the structure of the legislation. We had actually put up a proposal to cover that. But in the discussion after that proposal was voted on Senator Minchin made it clear it was the view of the government that the bill provides for a capacity for indigenous land use agreements to have the force of this legislation under subclause 24BB(f), which is on page 21, lines 23 and 24.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That subclause currently reads `any other matter concerning native title rights and interests in relation to the area'. The argument put forward by the government was that those words will allow anyone who wants to enter into an indigenous land use agreement with respect to past or intermediate period acts to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be able to do so under that subclause, 24BB(f). We thought that the best way to approach this was to in fact amend 24BB(a) to delete `future acts' or `future' to basically tie it in through that way, but we obviously were not successful in that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that Senator Minchin's and the government's understanding is that intermediate period and past act ILUAs are in fact embraced by 24BB(f), I will be moving amendments, which are being tabled and will not be here for a few minutes, to make it very clear that subclause 24BB(f) can embody both past and intermediate period acts. I will do that because, despite the government's assertion to that effect, it may very well be argued in the court that subclause 24BB(f) is to be read down in accordance with 24BB(a). If that were the case, our intention and the understanding of Senator Minchin would be frustrated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, with respect to 24BB&mdash;and there are two other areas of similar structure to which these amendments would be appropriate&mdash;we will be moving amendments to embody the spirit of the discussion just before lunch.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might raise this point. It may be best to leave this particular provision until we determine the most recently signalled opposition amendments. We are talking here about covering area agreements. We think it is important that area agreements be covered. If our next set of amendments get up&mdash;they reflect what you said before lunch was the state of the law&mdash;it probably will be important to allow rep bodies to have a role in the formulation of the area agreements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite obviously, whether or not our next set of amendments gets up, the question of area agreements is something which can be treated as being quite separate from the question of whether ILUAs can be extended to cover intermediate period and past acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our argument with respect to area agreements, as I put before lunch, is that we believe that the rep bodies should have a capacity to play a role back in the process. Senator Minchin's concern was that there is concern about rep bodies and their way of operation, and he was not keen to give them a role in respect of area agreements. The more I think of this, the more I think it is important for us to pursue this amendment because it is quite separate from what we voted on just before lunch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are concerned that rep bodies be given a role to, first, ensure some equity grounds in terms of the imbalance that currently exists between the native title holder claimant and the organisations with which he or she has to negotiate. The arguments before lunch were that rep bodies have a very important role under the act. The government is building on that role under its amendments 24CK and 24CL, particularly subsections (3) and (4) of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the rep body, after the operation of the process which is provided in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the legislation to ensure that they do meet certain accountability standards and the like, should also be given a role in respect of area agreements. Another reason we say that is that it is okay to give the rep bodies a role further down the process when, in a sense, they have to do all the cleaning up work and the mechanical work. But it is important for them to be there at the start as well so that they can ensure that much of the processing is on valid acceptable grounds right from the start. It is about the role of the rep bodies. It is separate from whether they have a role in respect of intermediate period acts and past acts. It is about the role of the rep bodies and what role they can play in the formulation of an area agreement in that process. I think it is important that we pursue this amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad Senator Bolkus realised halfway through that presentation that his foreshadowed amendment has absolutely nothing to do with amendment 37. Amendment 37 is entirely consequential upon what has just occurred. Amendment 37 should be opposed. Schedule 1, item 9 of proposed section 24CL should stand as printed because it provides for procedures that need to be followed for the registration of area agreements not certified by representative bodies, as I explained in our previous debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are the ones going a considerable way to enhance the role of representative bodies in relation to agreements, but we are stopping short of a monopoly arrangement. Therefore, you must provide for a mechanism by which agreements can be registered if they are not certified.

I am open to be persuaded here, but I just cannot work out how the result in the previous vote affects whether rep bodies should have a role with respect to area agreements. I know you are getting advice there at the moment, but my understanding is that the legislation will provide for registration of area agreements certified by rep bodies. That is an important part of their role. If you can explain how this is consequential on the previous amendment, I would like you to do it.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect to Senator Bolkus, it is important to understand that what we are doing here is providing a dual mechanism, which we think is very important for native title holders. They can, under CK, have their area agreements certified by the representative body. However, there is an alternative mechanism by which agreements can be registered if there is no certification by the representative body. We believe it is essential for native title holders to be able to reach agreements without that certification, but only on the basis that they satisfy the conditions in 24CL.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your previous amendments were to provide that area agreements could be registered only if they were certified. That is why you moved this amendment to delete CL. We have already had a vote on those amendments. Your proposition that area agreements can be registered only if they are certified was not passed. Therefore, consequentially, your amendment to delete CL should be rejected on the basis that you do need an alternative arrangement for those area agreements that are not certified by rep bodies. That is set out in CL. It sets out in detail the conditions that must be satisfied before the Registrar can register such an agreement. Essentially it is easier to get a certified agreement registered than it is an uncertified one. But, as we have already said and already had the debate about it, we are not prepared to give rep bodies the

Proposed subsection 24CL(4)(b) states that the Registrar can take into account any information the Registrar is given on the matter by any representative Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander body or by any other body or person. Does that mean literally any other body or person? If so, how could the Registrar with equity, if you like, reject an application without giving the applicant a chance to be heard? If that is the approach that is taken, don't you then have in effect a full-scale hearing taking place? I am just wondering what is the point of having 24CL(4)(b) in there at all.

What we are talking about here is adding six words to 24BB(f) to make sure that what the minister has said would have effect. The minister just said once again that he has no problem with what we are trying to do but he does not want to cloud up his 342 page act with six extra words.</PARA></TALK.START>

What I am saying to you is, if what you have told this parliament is right, you should have no problem in adding the six extra words in this particular clause.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of opposition amendments to this area which can generally be called applications, and they go to the application process. I would like to speak to them as a batch. They appear on the running sheet. There are seven or eight of them. I indicate at this stage that we will not be proceeding with circulated amendment No. 243. A bit of duplication is involved and so we do not need to proceed with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are concerned about workability. That has been one of our driving forces in producing the 350 or so amendments on this side of the parliament. Workability has a number of different dimensions. One of them is to see what sort of process we can develop and how flexible that process can be to ensure positive and agreed outcomes in one sense, and ready and quick outcomes in another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The particular background to this area goes to the Brandy decision, which has necessitated quite a number of amendments to the structure of the tribunal and the court in its interaction with respect to native title applications. It is for that reason that we accepted the amendments circulated and moved by Senator Minchin in amendment block 16. We are concerned that in the bill itself the government has in many ways overreached what we think was necessary for it to enact and has gone too far in a way that impinges not just on people's basic rights but also on a fair process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, the government is doing a number of things. Formerly, for instance, all applica 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9801"> tions were commenced in the tribunal. Under the amendment we just picked up, applications are to commence in the Federal Court, where any opposing party may bring an application to strike them down. But much of the work will still be conducted in the tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The strike&hyphen;out provisions in the act allow the court to strike out applications which do not meet the necessary application requirements&mdash;this is in proposed section 61&mdash;or if any of the areas of the application have been the subject of a previous exclusion possession act, or the applicant claims exclusive possession over an area covered by a previous non-exclusive possession act, or a native title determination has already been made for an area. The application may also be struck down if required documents and information which accompany the application are not provided&mdash;this is in proposed section 62&mdash;and the court is required to consider the strike&hyphen;out application before the application can proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also requirements as to information and material. The application must contain, amongst other things, results and copies of searches carried out to determine any non-native title interests in the area. A description of the native title interests and rights claimed must be supplied along with a general description and the factual basis on which the claim is asserted. Details of any activities currently carried on in relation to the land by the claimant group are also implied, as are the details of any other applications to the courts or a recognised state or territory body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have some criticisms of the government's position. It is worth putting them on record here, because we will be handling quite of few of them in this part of the debate. Following the Brandy decision, there is consensus as to the role of the Federal Court and the tribunal. As I said earlier, we think the provisions unnecessarily overreach in a number of different ways. In terms of the process itself, a claim cannot be registered if the application covers an area which has at any time in the past or present been covered by a previous exclusive possession act. These acts are defined to include grants which con 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fer exclusive possession as well as crown to crown grants, those contained in the schedule of interests and areas relating to public works. We will be tackling those sorts of issues in other parts of the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A claim can also not be registered if it seeks exclusive possession over an area that has at any time&mdash;I stress this&mdash;in the past or present been subject to a non&hyphen;exclusive pastoral or agricultural lease. So historic leases can have an effect that is totally unnecessary for this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the provisions proceed on a fundamental misunderstanding of the state of the common law. I do not know whether it is intentional; I suspect that it is. The government's own explanatory memorandum confirms that the question of whether native title is permanently extinguished or merely suppressed for the term of the inconsistent grant remains a question open at common law. We feel that the provision that does other than that is a massive overreach of the common law. There cannot be any justification for a prohibition on the registration of claims where it is not certain that the native title rights are inconsistent with the rights of others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to go to a number of the specific parts of the test which are particularly unjust. First, the test takes into account grants which may not still be in existence. The land may be, for instance, crown land. In the absence of a clear position at common law, we believe that there is no justifiable basis upon which the right to negotiate can be denied due to some dealing with the land in an earlier part of this century or perhaps even a later part of the previous century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, if one of these acts occurs in relation to any part&mdash;I stress this&mdash;of the claimed area, the whole claim will not be registered. You cannot justify this. Thirdly, there is to be no registration for claims over crown to crown or crown to statutory authority grants. This is due to the combined effects of sections 190B(8), 68A(2) and 23B. This is contrary to the Native Title Act, which states that a validated grant from crown to crown or crown to statutory authority does not extinguish native title but rather is subject to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9802"> non&hyphen;extinguishment principle. Again, this runs counter to the common law position articulated in Mabo No. 2.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth concern in respect of this part of the test is that, as a matter of procedure, the government is making it very difficult for the Registrar to determine what are exclusive possession acts. There is no objective test to be exercised. That has to be of concern to us all. In the absence of such a test, we will get further litigation and further uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another problem that can be mentioned here relates to multiple claims. We know what the government is trying to do in this respect. There may, for instance, on the one hand be overlapping claims with a legitimate reason for them to be overlapping in that they may reflect the traditional law and social organisation of a particular community. But in respect of the overlapping claims provision&mdash;we will discuss it later&mdash;we do not think the government has fixed up the problem. We have amendments in respect of it that we will move later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should focus on the complexity and ambiguity of some of the provisions here. We should address them for a few moments. We believe that the proposed test is extremely complex. It raises a range of problems.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will go the application provisions, as you say. It is important to put on record some of the broader concerns we have which lead up to the contextual problem we have in this area. We have about seven or eight amendments to put in respect of the application test. I do not know what attitude the government will take. There may have been an indication from them that some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of them are attractive. Amendments Nos 217 and 298 make it very clear that the native title claim group includes all people who can claim to hold the particular native title. That is important in respect of some of the broader considerations I mentioned earlier. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 229 replaces the absolute prohibition on claims over previous exclusive possession tenures and exclusive rights and non&hyphen;exclusive tenures with an obligation to adhere to the common law principles. I made that point earlier. Amendment 230 clarifies details with respect to access that was prevented. Amendment 232 allows for combined applications for determination for compensation in respect of areas within the boundaries of the area claimed for a determination of native title or, as an alternative, under section 62. Amendment 233 relates to the role and scope of authority of the registered application and ensures that it is more clearly defined. Flexibility is also provided by allowing the placement of the authorised claimant. Amendments 234 and 235 ensure that claims for a determination only do not have to be considered for registration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a number of other amendments, most of which are of a consequential nature. Amendment 239, for instance, ensures representative bodies receive notice of claims. Amendment 240 is a consequential amendment to ensure that claims for a determination only do not have to be considered for registration. Amendment 243 is not to be moved. Amendment 244, in particular, leaves some necessary flexibility to the court in deciding whether to amalgamate overlapping claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, we go to the process in the context of some of the broader amendments made by the government, but we think that our further amendments to the government's provisions actually provide for flexibility and fairness.</PARA>

I do not think there is a need for Labor amendments Nos 230 and 231. Therefore, when we get to that stage, I will be seeking to move amendments 197 and 198 because they omit that part of the bill requiring the current physical connection.

We have no objection to amendment 230&mdash;although I think I heard Senator Margetts say that she is opposed to it&mdash;or amendment 239 of the ALP amendments. For the benefit of Senator Brown, who is not here, we are not taking a blanket opposition. Where it is clear that there is no difficulty with the acceptance of amendments, we will do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These application mechanisms and provisions do, in some way, flow from the confir 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9804"> mation regime. I know down the track we will have some differences of opinion on that. As I understand, the ALP remains committed to the complete removal of our provisions merely confirming that, where exclusive possession acts have taken place, they extinguish native title. Given that we are proposing a confirmation regime, therefore, the claims process should reflect that. That would mean that claims cannot be made over previous exclusive possession acts and that exclusive possession claims cannot be made over land subject to a previous non&hyphen;exclusive possession act such as a pastoral lease. In other words, you cannot have a claim accepted for exclusive possession over a pastoral lease because obviously there is someone else, a co&hyphen;tenant. That really is a very important part of our policy of bringing certainty to land management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was pleased to see and I welcome Mr Pearson's statement that it is unfortunate that some ambit claims are being made for exclusive possession where there are other co&hyphen;tenants of the land. This provision just ensures that, if you are claiming native title in relation to a co&hyphen;tenement, that you are not able to lodge that claim for exclusive possession but you can claim anything else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are deleting the confirmation provisions and simply providing that claims must not, as far as is reasonably practical, cover an area in relation to which native title has been extinguished, which is what is being claimed here, that, from our point of view, is a much vaguer and more uncertain test and really would not be a significant hurdle for ambit claims. I suspect it starts to get us back into the one&hyphen;year problem where you will have claims being registered of dubious merit&mdash;claims being accepted, I should say. I am not talking about registration here; I am talking about acceptance of claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, legal consequences flow from acceptance of claims and it is most likely that, without the provisions we are proposing, or if you accept the opposition amendments, you will find that claims will be accepted, with the Federal Court taking a cautious approach in the sense that it will accept claims even 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> where there may be absolutely no chance of ultimate success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the provisions that are proposed by the ALP are linked to the suggestion that rep bodies can certify claims and that, if so certified, these claims can be registered unless the registrar is satisfied that the representative body could not reasonably have done so. Again, we have problems in this area. While our bill significantly clarifies and expands the role of rep bodies, their principal responsibility is to be advocates for and support native title claims and it is, therefore, inappropriate that they should also have the role of assessing whether the claims they make are credible and well researched so that they should go on the register and provide to claimants the significant right to negotiate and other rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to touch on the question of the number of native title claims in an area and determinations. We think that it is highly desirable for everybody involved in this process that there should generally be only one determination of native title for a particular area. But of course, there can be more than one group of native title holders for the area&mdash;that is self&hyphen;evident and obvious&mdash;but that the question of native title in the area should be dealt with in one determination. So there can be more than one group of native title holders for the area but, when the Federal Court is considering a claim for the area, it should consider all the claims for that area. To this extent, the role of the court is to some extent inquisitorial, which we think is desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions in relation to notification, parties, process and registration encourage this. Section 67 is important for this policy since it provides that the court must make orders to ensure that applications over the same area are dealt with in the same proceedings. Amendment 244 would weaken that policy by changing the `must' to `may' and therefore undermine our policy objective of seeking to ensure that all native title claims in relation to an area are dealt with in the one determination, rather than a never ending sequence of ongoing determinations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is one of the real theoretical problems with native title that a court hears a determi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9805"> nation in relation to native title in an area but then for ever and a day you can have consequential native title claims over the same area. It is obviously good public policy for everybody concerned that, in relation to an area, everyone who claims native title is dealt with at the one time. It does not mean that the court cannot find that a number of groups claiming native title hold native title to the area. Of course, it would then be a matter for the court to determine which groups hold what title and how they interrelate. If we are all to be faced with never&hyphen;ending sequences of ongoing native title claims and determinations, many of which may cover the same area, this process will never be brought to a satisfactory resolution in everyone's interests.</PARA>

One would assume that in the great majority of circumstances of access this distinction would be irrelevant.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Amendment 229 gives me some concern and I would like to hear what Senator Bolkus and Senator Minchin might say about those concerns. Amendment 229 proposes to substitute the provisions of Schedule 2, item 19, subsections (2) and (3). To my way of thinking, subsections (2) and (3) appear to be more certain than the ones, with due respect, that you have proposed in amendment 229. Amendment 229 states:</PARA></TALK.START>

It does add that extra uncertainty which, to my way of thinking, both sides of the chamber are trying to avoid.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME><STATE> (South Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(2.19 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Harradine is actually focusing on `as far as is reasonably practicable'. Our concern with the government's 61A(2) and (3) is that they are essentially a pretty substantial overreach. Far from provid 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing certainty they overreach in terms of extinguishment and probably will provide a fair degree of uncertainty as a consequence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 229 replaces the absolute prohibition on claims over previous exclusive possession tenures and exclusive rights on non&hyphen;exclusive tenures with an obligation of adhering to common law principles. That basically sums up what we are doing. We also provide that claims should not be made in areas where native title is extinguished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, what the common law has done is leave open whether in fact native title is extinguished or is suppressed for the term of an inconsistent grant. That is the question that remains open in common law. It was left open in the Wik case. The government's explanatory memorandum confirms that the common law has left it open. To the extent that the common law has left it open, there will always be a capacity for people to pursue claims for what we see, through this legislation, as unnecessary extinguishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not have to go this far. You do not have to go to the extent that the government is going. They are misrepresenting the state of the common law. Their  explanatory memorandum says that. Advice from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department on 23 January this year and even more recently in their circular has reflected that as well. Common law has not determined whether native title is permanently extinguished by a previous grant of exclusive possession or exclusive rights on non&hyphen;exclusive tenures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the first concern we have. We have concerns because in, for instance, the deliberations of the Joint Committee on Native Title there was a lot of evidence showing that there had been previous exclusive possession acts, but that those acts had terminated and had run their course. Despite their having run their course, this government is trying to extinguish native title in respect of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about a substantial portion of land. We are also talking about, for instance, the case and the claim that was mentioned in the House of Representatives a couple of days ago by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer). The claim that has been pursued in Queensland by Noel Pearson, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9810"> amongst many others, goes to an area over which there had been a number of pastoral leases. Those leases have now run their course. That land is now unallocated state land. As a consequence of that, the Cape York Land Council has put a claim in. Almost 1,500 people there have put a claim in, and Mr Pearson is one of those 1,500. If this legislation were to pass and if this particular provision were to have the effect that the government wants it to have, I think the Cape York Land Council could probably either start other proceedings or look to other areas to claim proceedings. That is just one example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a lot of evidence in the Joint Committee on Native Title of examples where there had been a lease which had run its course, which was now either a ghost lease or a historic lease, and had either reverted to crown land or whatever. But, under the common law decisions of Mabo and subsequent decisions, it would be a legitimate claim for native title rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So not only are we concerned about the point I mentioned earlier but also we are concerned that what is covered here is historic leases as well. We also have some concern that the definition provided by the government includes grants which confer exclusive possession as well as crown to crown grants and areas relating to public works. Basically, as I said at the start, this is very much an overreach. To the extent that you might think there is certainty provided here, all these considerations I have just mentioned make it very certain that it would be uncertain, that the indigenous Australians would pursue common law claims and pursue other avenues to try to extract rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also think there is no need for this. If you want to provide certainty for pastoral interests, not only do you have the protection of the common law itself in Wik, but you have other measures in the legislation&mdash;particularly the validation regime, for instance, whatever one gets up&mdash;which would provide that as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Senator Harradine, I hope this answers some of your questions. I do not know whether I have answered all of them but, in essence, we are talking here of an overreach 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which is, as I have often called it in the past, somewhat gratuitous extinguishment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I would be interested in the minister's response, but it is clear that the common law is as described by Senator Bolkus.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9811"> where there is a pastoral lease, you cannot claim exclusive possession. That is one of the problems and, to his credit, Noel Pearson acknowledged that. Farming families are receiving native title claims which claim exclusive possession. We know in here why that is. They are following the wording of the Mabo decision. They are taking the straight wording of the determination, which was exclusive in that case, but they are using that wording when they make their claims over pastoral leases. Of course, by definition, as a result of the Wik case, native title can be claimed but, by definition, exclusive possession cannot be determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So all we are saying is, yes, we are setting in place here the application process to enable native title claims to be made over pastoral leases. All we are saying is that, if the claim contains the individual claim for exclusive possession, that part of the claim cannot be accepted, and that is all. But claims can be made. So, if it is a historic lease, of course the claim can be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you are aware, in other amendments we are separately providing that, where there has been an historic lease and Aboriginal people are in occupation of the lands, whether it is vacant crown land or a reserve has been put on the old lease, then we are proposing in our amendments that the previous lease be disregarded for the purposes of the native title claim. So in those cases they would be able to claim exclusive possession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think we are going a long way towards meeting some of the issues that have been raised with us. We think what is proposed here is fair and certain. The process set down here will allow claims to be made over 79 per cent of Australia. I do believe it is worthy of support, because it does guarantee that on the one hand, while guaranteeing certainty on the other, and dealing with the situation of native title claims being made and accepted where as a matter of common law, as we understand the common law, there is no possibility of it succeeding.</PARA></SPEECH>

That would not be the case in respect of areas over which there had been a previous exclusive possession tenure and in that respect we are talking about a pastoral lease.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a very good case at hand and that is the one I mentioned earlier. There is land in Cape York and a claim has been lodged by some 1,500 people. The area was the subject of three pastoral leases and those pastoral leases have run their course. Now there is the situation where there had been an exclusive tenure which has run out and the land is now unallocated state land. It is on this land that the Cape York Land Council has made a claim for native land title. That was the case mentioned by Mr Fischer earlier in the week in his attempt to try and paint Mr Pearson into a corner, which failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can you justify stopping the Cape York Land Council from being able to pursue their claim on land that had been either exclusive or non-exclusive tenure but there had been a lease there? How can you justify that? This is just an enormous overreach of the law. That is what Senator Minchin and the government are trying to do through subclauses 2 and 3. That is one particular problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you think that is not an invitation to ensure further court cases, I do not know what is. In this particular case there is already an application in place. These people have exercised their rights under the existing law. If we go ahead and change that law, then a whole host of cases from Georgiardis a few years ago to Mewett now&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> cases&mdash;will demand a payment of compensation. It will ensure that this particular case will finish up in the High Court, but this is just one case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people are exercising an existing right under the law. We are here today con 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9812"> templating foreclosing their capacity to pursue that right. If the government is successful here today, there will be Georgiardis, Mewett, Pearson and 1,500 others pursuing this particular case in the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think in all social conscience that we could actually do that, and what for? Because someone a few years ago had a lease there. That was a few years ago. This government talks about a schedule in terms of previous leases that is so wide ranging and back reaching that it is talking about regimes that could have issued leases 150 years ago. They could be leases that expired last generation and the government cannot say that that is not the case because it does not know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence before the joint parliamentary committee made it very clear the government did not know. They are talking about ghost leases and historic leases. They have not gone through each one of them to see whether they still exist. They cannot say with any degree of certainty what lease is covered and what is not. They cannot tell us what lease has expired, because they did not go through that process one by one. They went through enabling legislation. If they thought that enabling legislation by its character was good enough and that it might have provided exclusive tenure at some stage, then they listed that. As a consequence of listing that, people lose their native title rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no uncertainty there. You cannot tell us which leases still continue, still prevail or still run. Of those leases which have expired you cannot tell us when they expired. On the basis of that you are asking us to extinguish native title. They have claims, but they have claims for what? Let us face it, you are ripping apart what they can claim for and in what circumstances they can claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about a not insubstantial portion of Australian land here. For instance, if you look at historic tenures in the Northern Territory some 30 per cent of the land there at some stage past was subject to a lease but is now not. How can you in all conscience say to Pearson and the others, `Okay, there was a lease there some time ago, but because of a matter of accident of history, bad luck fellas.' They will render the Mabo decision an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> empty shell in respect of such a great proportion of the land to which they may legitimately have a claim for native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot do that in all conscience and you cannot in all legal certainty do it, and you know it. This is an enormous overgrab or overreach in this legislation and it is a very false one and one that really cannot in all moral conscience be substantiated, because you do not even know what particular leases you are talking about and you have not even pretended to list those tenures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, you are talking about a big area in respect of the Northern Territory and you are talking about a big area in respect of Queensland, but you are also talking about people who should have a legitimate expectation that they are able to lodge a native title claim in respect of this area after Mabo. They have been fighting for 200 years to get these rights. They got them in Mabo. They had them verified in Wik. We want to provide certainty for pastoralists, industry and so on, but we also want to provide justice&mdash;and this is not just. There is another dimension to this to worry about: who is going to pay for it? Who is going to pay for this overreach? You might be worried about lawyers, Senator Harradine, but we are asking the Australian taxpayer to pay for something that they do not have to pay for. They do not have to pay for this because this is not necessary to provide the certainty that we want to provide to those legitimate interests that are still going on. And pay for it they will, because the High Court has already made it very clear that what we are doing here is taking away a property right.</PARA>

You expect a native title claimant to match you with all your resources in government; not just the federal government, but all the state and territory governments too. You expect those poor battlers to try to work out what claims they have got to contend with. They have got Buckley's chance and you know it.

If you want to have coexistence, that is different from a claim for exclusive possession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the greatest of respect to Senator Bolkus, I think he was gilding the lily a little bit to say just a moment ago that the claims over Cape York Peninsula were solely claims over leases which had expired.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made on 9 October 1997 and acknowledged by the Cape York Land Council was a claim over a lease called Shelbourne Bay which is extant. The lessee is in occupation and is working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to have cooperation, if you want to have coexistence, you do not make a claim for exclusive possession over that sort of lease. All it does is pit people against each other, because if you are the lessee and somebody makes a claim over your lease for exclusive possession, if you are in occupation and it is a real valid lease, of course you have to defend it, and it makes it harder to get agreement. I know the Cape very well. Many of the graziers up there are actually happy to say, `We'll even do a deal and excise bits out, but we're not going to have claims for exclusive possession.' What Senator Minchin is putting forward would resolve that problem. I think if honourable senators are interested in cooperation, interested in coexistence, Senator Minchin's clause here in the bill makes that possible and that is why I believe it ought to be followed.</PARA></SPEECH>

If there is a test case or a case in relation to one of those western division leases, it may be that the court finds that they are the kind of pastoral lease that grants exclusive possession, but that is entirely a matter for the courts. The only ones that would be affected by this acceptance test, which is what we are talking about here, in terms of where claims could not be made at all, are the ones that are listed as previous exclusive possession acts, and, as I say, there is not one pastoral lease on that schedule of previous exclusive possession acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in relation to pastoral leases, claims can be made, but you cannot claim possession to the exclusion of all others. A claim for possession to the exclusion of all others could be struck out to the extent that that was the nature of the claim. You can claim everything else and have your claim accepted.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also have a question for the Special Minister of State (Senator Minchin). It does not relate to the exclusive possession section of this but to clause 3, which strikes out the possibility of an Aboriginal claimant making a claim to the exclusion of all others over an area that was previously non&hyphen;exclusive but `the act was an act attributable to the Commonwealth', and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A great deal of the Northern Territory was originally covered by pastoral leases. Back in my CSIRO days, we consistently came across the original signs of abandoned pastoral leases. They are available in the Territory everywhere&mdash;broken&hyphen;down old horse&hyphen;drawn farm equipment and so on, stuck under trees. A great deal of the Territory was covered by these things. The Simpson Desert was covered by pastoral leases. Areas of the Western Desert were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might be wrong in my understanding of this, and you can correct me if I am. In the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9817"> original Mabo case, as I understood it, it was determined that native title could consist of a whole range of things, from very minimal rights up to and including rights that were analogous to freehold; in other words, exclusive possession. Indeed, that is the kind of title which the claimants in the original case were able to establish over their own land. What I wanted to ask you was this, in terms of simple justice, not law: if there is an area of land in Australia that previously was covered by a pastoral lease but is now not covered by a pastoral lease and is to all intents and purposes vacant and is not being used by anybody, and if Aboriginal claimants are able to satisfy&mdash;this would be difficult, but if they were able to satisfy&mdash;a court that their occupancy and continued use and possession of the land were as good as those of the claimants in the original case, why should they not be able to make a claim over that land?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins, they can make a claim over that land. Prima facie, they can make the native title claim. The only thing that is provided for in 61A is that, if the claim is to the exclusion of all others, that part of the claim could not be accepted. They can claim everything else in relation to native title rights. That is the only part of the claim that could not be accepted; they could claim everything else. But we are actually dealing with the sort of situation I think you are suggesting by providing in our amendments for where there has been an historic lease. So they can make the claim over the historic lease; no question about that. But, where there is an historic lease and the Aboriginal people are in occupation, be it vacant crown land or whether as a reserve now on that previous lease, they can claim exclusive possession under the amendments that we are proposing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me take you through it again.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will have the discussion about the registration test. We are including in the registration test a requirement that one member of the claim group must have or have had that physical connection. In other words, to get registered, to attract all the benefits of the right to negotiate and all that sort of thing, if there is a claim group of 300 or something, all we are saying in the registration test is that one member should currently have or have had at any stage in their life a physical connection to the land claim&mdash;which does not seem unreasonable given that, to prove your native title claim, the court has said that you have got to have maintained a traditional connection to the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to be accused of any deception here.

What if you put it in conjunction with the fact that this government is saying that they want one application, they want to be able to hone down the number of applications?

On the application you put in, `Skills in this may be useful or may be of benefit.' Then when you get down to it you can pick off the ones that do not have that in.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to endorse what Senator Margetts and Senator Woodley have been saying. This section is not here to fill up space. It is here to encourage applicants to give the details not just of their physical connection with the land that is under claim but of their traditional physical connection and any reason as to why that has been prevented. It is already one step towards saying, if you cannot show that, you are in a different category. The minister may shake his head, but that is exactly what the intention is here. It is a deterrent for people who cannot meet clearly or easily the requirements of 621C and it puts them in another category. This is a moot point. It is one of these indefinable clauses which are sectioning people out, which are qualifying claims. That is why we are worried about it. The alarm bells are ringing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no mention of spiritual connection here. Maybe that should have been mentioned. We are not dealing with just the physical world when it comes to Aboriginal claims to land. We are dealing very much with spiritual connection.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> That would have shown a bit more understanding by the people who have drawn up these amendments, namely, the government. But it is not here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are getting ourselves on the road towards the impossibility of or, more pertinently, the unfairness in people who have seen forcible dispossession in their history over the last 200 years approaching the claims through application and raising their rights to proceed through to the point where they see a claim validated.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is there no reference to the spiritual or cultural connection with the land here? Why is just the physical connection mentioned? That is a central point of this process we are dealing with.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The European history is one which deals with physical disconnection because there was no understanding of the spiritual connection, but here we are seeing in this amendment that physical connection being required. But we know that that is going to be an impediment to some people considering whether or not they can make a claim. I just make that point in supporting what the previous speakers in this corner of the chamber have said. I do question the minister as to why the spiritual connection has not been put in along with the physical connection. Was it considered not worthy of mention in the same paragraph?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect to Senator Brown's question, this section does not require the claimants to establish in any way either a spiritual or a physical connection for the purposes of having their claim accepted. They get accepted at the Federal Court and then they can proceed with their claim for a determination that they hold native title. It is entirely left to the courts at to whether or not the claimants have established the traditional connection, whatever that means&mdash;that is a matter for the courts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown is quite right to state that many Aboriginal people would assert that, when it comes to establishing to the satisfaction of a court that they have maintained their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9824"> connection, a spiritual connection will suffice. That is left by this entirely. That is why we are not requiring them at this stage to satisfy either a spiritual or physical connection&mdash;because that is left entirely to the courts. They simply lodge their application, they are required to give a bit of information, but their claim then just proceeds through the Federal Court to the question of determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, certainly most people agree that, when it comes to the registration of a claim for the purposes of access to the statutory right to negotiate and other statutory benefits, people go from the application level up to the registration test. There is general agreement that we need to have a more robust registration test so that when the right to negotiate process is triggered everybody involved in the right to negotiate process knows they are dealing with fair dinkum claimants who are likely to succeed in their claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, at the level of the registration test, not at the application level, one of the elements of the registration test that we are proposing is that one member of the claim group&mdash;and, as I say, we do not put any limit on the size of the claim group; it could be 10,000 people&mdash;must have or have had a traditional physical connection. We are not even saying what that is&mdash;that is a matter for the registrar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are just saying that claimants who lodge an application may then wish to have it registered, so at the stage of the application they then at that point include any details relating to any physical connection they may have had. They do not have to. If they are not interested in registration, it does not matter a bar at all&mdash;they just proceed with their claim and it is a matter for the court as to whether a determination that they hold native title is made. We are not at this stage putting anything in the way of that. It is simply that, if they then wish to move to registration, they have already included in their application the relevant information. They are not required to do it at that stage under our process, which no doubt you will oppose later. At the registration test level we are saying the registrar needs to be satisfied that one member had at 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some time in the past or currently has that physical connection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So all we are saying is that we are offering them the opportunity at this stage of the process to include such information in their claim, but the absence of such information will have absolutely no bearing whatsoever on the acceptance of their claim in the Federal Court.</PARA></SPEECH>
