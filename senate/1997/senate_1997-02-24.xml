<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill establishes a trust fund of a billion dollars sourced from the partial sale of Telstra, with $700 million directed to five environment and sustainable agriculture projects over the next five years, with the remaining $300 million to be held in the fund in perpetuity. The funds provided from the partial sale of Telstra are to be devoted to five program areas: education, rivers, biodiversity, land care, coasts and clean seas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The initiatives outlined in the bill are worthwhile and they have the support of the Labor opposition. In fact, most of these initiatives were contained in Labor's `Our Land' environment policy announced prior to the 1996 election. Labor therefore supports the establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust but let me make it clear again that we
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have never supported the linkage of the trust to the sale of Telstra. We also have grave concerns about the drafting of this bill, particularly its lack of appropriate accountability measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past year the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) and many other members of the coalition government have argued the need for substantially more money to be allocated to environment programs. The sale of Telstra and the establishment of this trust, they claim, would substantially address the major environmental problems facing our nation. But the Howard government's rhetoric is at odds with their action on the environment. The 13 per cent cut to the environment budget in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget and the plethora of anti&hyphen;environment decisions taken over the past year tell the real story of the Howard government's lack of concern for the environment. Since coming to office, the Howard government have shown no leadership on important environment matters of national significance. Instead of protecting our environment, their record has been one of disregard for the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the government that has all but given the green light to the expansion of uranium mining in the Kakadu world heritage area; that has cut the environment budget by $30 million; that has given the green light to aspects of Keith Williams's massive Hinchinbrook resort development, despite departmental and scientific advice concluding that it would have an adverse impact on the world heritage values of the adjacent Hinchinbrook channel; that has given state governments veto powers over the listing of world heritage areas; that has attempted to abolish its export control powers for minerals; that has approved the largest volume in Australia's history of native forest woodchips to be exported; that has abandoned the 15 per cent old growth conservation criterion for native forests; that has abolished the ethanol bounty scheme designed to assist in the development of cleaner fuels; that has cut labour market programs with significant environmental components, such as the LEAP program; and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="768"> that has diluted Australia's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Natural Heritage Trust is a gimmick designed to disguise this government's massive cuts to environment spending and its appalling record of anti&hyphen;environment decisions. The government's environment record and the history of this trust make it very clear that the protection and conservation of the environment are not the main purpose of this bill. In fact, the environment has always rated very low in terms of government priorities on this government's agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Natural Heritage Trust is the only commitment this government has made to the environment and it was a commitment contingent on the partial sale of Telstra. The government has made much of its commitment to spend a billion dollars on the environment. However, a careful analysis of the funding provided for the Natural Heritage Trust reveals that the much touted billion dollars translates into just $84.3 million per year over and above what has already been committed by the former Labor government from consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite promising with great fanfare that the fund would be `additional to Labor's budgeted funding for the environment and sustainable agriculture elements of the Primary Industry portfolio', the reality is that cuts to both Environment Australia and DPIE in the recent budget mean that this year's funding on the environment and land management programs&mdash;landcare in the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin initiative&mdash;will be down by at least $76 million. Even with the funds from the sale of Telstra, the extra funding per annum for the life of this government is just $59 million&mdash;hardly the great bonanza that was promised from the $10 billion sale of one of our most precious public assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After taking account of the funds exclusively allocated to Tasmania as a result of arrangements with Senator Harradine, the states and territories will share an extra $42 million per year. When allocated on a proportional basis between the states, it becomes even clearer that the additional resources available for environment improvement are minimal.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The government's only argument for establishing a trust is, to use their own words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">. . . to provide assurance that there was a greater certainty of funding for nominated projects over a period of time than would be the case under the normal annual appropriations process.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government, however, has provided no certainty of funding for the environment. The budgeted cuts to Environment Australia's forward estimates indicate that instead of providing `certainty of funding' the trust is simply replacing consolidated revenue environment funds with Telstra money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Removing environment funding from the normal budgeting process may actually weaken the capacity of the environment to secure important funding in the future. The environment&hyphen;Telstra link sets a very bad precedent for environment funding. In five years' time when the trust's funds are depleted, Australia will still have major environment programs that need funding. What public asset will the government sell then? And what happens when we run out of public assets to sell? How then will the environment be funded?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Natural Heritage Trust legislation is this government's only commitment to the environment and yet it offers no direction or philosophical commitment to the environment. Once again, the only conclusion you can reach is that this is a gimmick. This conclusion has been given some currency in a report in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Science Technology</EMPHASIS>, a monthly round&hyphen;up of science and technology in Australia. An article&mdash;you should read this, Senator Hill&mdash;headed `Natural Heritage Trust Fund a fraud admits coalition senior adviser' goes into some detail about precisely how that fraud was engineered and perpetrated on the Australian people. Perhaps Senator Hill does not have to read it because he knows all about the fraud. But I would like to put on the record exactly what this article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Howard Government's proposed Natural Heritage Trust is a blatant and cynical fraud.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That phrase `blatant and cynical fraud' is attributed to a senior government adviser. He says that the policy, the coalition's claimed answer to Australia's enormous environmental problems was, as he puts it, `invented
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="769"> overnight' as a means of attempting to soften public reaction against the planned sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra. The government's ruse has been revealed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The plan has essentially been devised&mdash;and, again, I quote this adviser&mdash;`as a purely political exercise' by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Andrew Robb, and had then been `imposed'&mdash;that being the adviser's word&mdash;on the former shadow minister for the environment, Senator Rod Kemp, and subsequently, he says, on the current Minister for the Environment, Senator Robert Hill. These are all claims attributed to the senior adviser.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The senior adviser said that senior coalition MPs `openly joked behind closed doors' about the policy and admitted to the fact that it `couldn't possibly' in its current form or size make any serious impact on the nation's massive problems of land degradation, ailing rivers and loss of bio&hyphen;diversity. He said that the extent of the deceit had `sickened him' and a number of other coalition staffers were also sickened&mdash;and they were people apparently genuinely concerned about the national environment for the sake of the nation's long&hyphen;term future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same article this journal was told by the adviser:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">We were appalled at the lies and deception involved in this issue. It's an exercise just based on one thing&mdash;finding a way to sell off Telstra.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The linkage to the environment is just a sop designed to cloud the Telstra sale issue and to try to blackmail other parties and the general community into accepting it.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Anyone who looks at the figures can quickly see the Natural Heritage Trust is a blatant and cynical political fraud. There is simply no way the interest from the $1 billion supposed to be diverted from the Telstra sale could possibly pay to rectify the enormous environmental problems confronting Australia.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The real motivation  behind this bill is not the protection and conservation of the environment but rather a means to persuade a sufficient number of senators to support the Telstra legislation. The trust's first major purchase cost $115 million, approximately 10 per cent of the total funds provided for the trust, and it guaranteed the vote of Senator
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Harradine during the Telstra debate last year. Since last year's Telstra vote, I personally believe this bill should be renamed `the natural heritage slush fund' because that is what it is, a natural heritage slush fund. That much more accurately reflects and represents the intentions of this fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a poorly drafted piece of legislation. The bill does not guarantee that there will be funding for the major environmental problems faced by Australia. For example, the loss of native vegetation, the loss of bio&hyphen;diversity within Australia, is one of the major environmental issues facing this country. Whilst those issues are covered under the national vegetation initiative, there is no mechanism for ensuring that any money is spent on them. Similarly, the proposed subsection 21(3)(vi) talks of using `cost&hyphen;effective and flexible measures'; however, the bill is silent on what the costs are that are included in this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The poor drafting of this bill and many other concerns were raised in the Senate legislative committee's report on the bill. Unfortunately, the committee's recommendations have been substantially ignored by the government and Senator Hill. The government's disregard for the committee's findings are extraordinary considering it was Senator Hill himself who actually referred the bill to the committee. But, of course, the minister has shown a real disregard for ensuring the trust is properly established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the evidence suggests that the government has cynically established this trust as a public relations tool to disguise its appalling environment record. Why else would Senator Hill send a Senate committee around the country holding public meetings up hill and down dale and then ignore its recommendations? We can only conclude that the Senate committee's hearings were a Howard government public relations exercise&mdash;a PR exercise to muddy the debate surrounding the partial sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Premier Court understood the true Liberal Party purpose of the fund when he promised $30 million a year for 10 years of the trust fund's money for a Western Australian salinity action program as part of his re-election
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="770"> campaign. Mr Court's promise of $300 million over 10 years was amazing considering the total allocation for vegetation associated initiatives under the Natural Heritage Trust is $318 million over five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the opposition could not ascertain the veracity of this promise when it asked the Prime Minister to confirm such a commitment, and I would appreciate it if the minister could clarify that issue for us as well as how much the Commonwealth government in fact did promise Richard Court for his salinity action plan. If you cannot do that, Minister, again, it will expose you and your government and it will expose this bill for what it is: another example of Liberal Party chicanery in the lead-up to the Western Australian poll last year and a further confirmation that the trust fund is actually a Liberal Party slush fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are have learnt from these sorts of examples of vote buying with the trust's funds is that, unless very strong accountability mechanisms are included in this bill, the trust's funds will not be directed on a needs basis to address the very serious environmental problems facing Australia but rather allocated for political purposes. The need for greater accountability mechanisms to be included in the bill was constantly raised during the Senate committee's hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill, as it is currently drafted, does not include measures to account for improvements as a result of expenditure programs against base level data and objectives, to ensure that no project receives funding where the existing regulations will work against achievements of the trust's goals, nor to ensure needs based funding. These concerns were all raised in the Senate committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The propensity for this government to use the trust fund for political rather than environmental objectives is a convincing argument in favour of amending the bill to include concrete mechanisms to ensure the trust can achieve its objectives. The poor drafting of the bill has created significant confusion about the role and composition of the trust's board. As the Senate report noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">. . . the word `Trust' appeared to imply that the fund would be outside the accountability process,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> perhaps because of how the community perceives the operation of family and private Trusts.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report also noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">. . . the use of the name `Board' to describe the partnership of administration between the Ministers for Primary Industries and Energy and Environment, Sport and Territories was also felt to convey the impression of a body less subject to parliamentary scrutiny . . . </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The committee called for greater explanation and clarity in the bill. I note the government's response was purely cosmetic&mdash;that is, to change the name of the board to the Natural Heritage Trust Ministerial Board. The opposition takes the issue of the board's composition a lot more seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides for a board comprising the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to be established. We are informed that the role of the board is to provide a forum for consultation between the two ministers. The opposition firmly believes that the composition of the board should be expanded to include people with expertise in environment and sustainable agriculture. An expanded board would guard against the trust's funds being allocated on purely political grounds and would ensure that the funds were allocated on the basis of need and properly distributed between the environment and primary industries portfolios. The bill, as it is now drafted, provides no such assurances. An expanded board could also provide the leadership and direction that is currently so lacking in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The distribution of resources and the strong likelihood of primary industries dominating the allocation of the trust's funds were consistently raised during the Senate inquiry's hearings. It seems very few people have any confidence at all in Senator Hill's capacity to protect important environment programs when they are in competition with primary industries projects. The Senate committee seems to have very little confidence in Senator Hill's capacity to protect the environment. The committee actually recommended that the legislation be amended to make it clear that the environment minister was chair of the board. I note that the government has rejected this recommendation as well.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="771">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising, Mr Acting Deputy President Chapman, that so few people like yourself have faith in Senator Hill. You are not disagreeing with that, are you! There has not been one issue in the time that he has been environment minister where he has actually had a victory for the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is he continually being rolled in the South Australian division of the Liberal Party but Senator Parer has also rolled him on the issue of mining exploration in forest reserves. Mr Anderson rolled him on the quantity of land allocated to dedicated forest reserves in the recently signed East Gippsland regional forest agreement. The Prime Minister has a tendency to pre-empt Senator Hill's decisions whether they be on the Port Hinchinbrook development or on the Point Lillias Ramsar listed wetlands. The minister's weakness and wimpiness is a very strong argument for expanding the board. Without some support from independent board members with a commitment to improving and protecting our environment, there is no guarantee that the trust will be dedicated to the most environmentally worthwhile and needy projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, let me say the opposition supports the establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust. A properly constructed trust fund could provide the leadership and money needed to improve some of the environmental problems facing this nation. However, unless this bill is amended to ensure proper accountability mechanisms are included and the trust's board is expanded, it is highly probable that the trust fund will become a Liberal Party slush fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have it in our power collectively to ensure that the fund is not abused in this way. I urge all senators to consider very carefully the various amendments which will come before the chamber and to support the incorporation of measures which will ensure decisions on disbursement of funds are informed by appropriate expertise and are fully accountable to the parliament and the public. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that we have before us today will not, as it stands, result in substantial improvements to the state of Australia's rivers and the health of our environment, be it our land or our coasts. It is fundamentally flawed from beginning to end. It fails to adequately define terms. It fails to adequately set out its objectives&mdash;what it is trying to do. It fails to establish performance measures. It has no time lines in it. It has no adequate accountability measures as far as either the environment or the money is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In line with the unanimous recommendations of the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislative Committee, I will be attempting to amend this bill. We are proposing 64 amendments. I stress here again that this committee was set up by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill). We went around the country telling people, `We are listening to you. Here we are, recognising your expertise.' We had a range of environment groups before us and people with considerable expertise from one end of the environment spectrum to the other; that is, from those considered to be more conservative in their views through to those who have been very active and outspoken. We now have a unanimous committee report that did take on board a lot of what we heard. Indeed, we considered all the evidence, sifted it carefully and came up with what I thought was a very balanced report. By and large, the government has thrown this out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be moving amendments to put in place an advisory committee which, I remind you again, was a unanimous recommendation of this committee. All of us on the committee agree that the minister would need good advice. I will be moving, as agreed unanimously by the committee, that the environment minister should take precedence. He should be the one who has the final say. After all, this is a bill about the environment. I cannot imagine the environment minister having carriage of a bill relating to primary industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate committee unanimously agreed that the further definition of terms and programs was required. Our amendments seek to clarify and strengthen definitions and objec
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="772"> tives. Many sections in the bill are sloppily or inadequately worded and give insufficient regard to the protection and repair of our environment. The committee unanimously agreed that the bill needs measuring sticks. We must be able to judge whether we are making progress. Our amendments will make sure that we can sit back and look at what we are doing and work out whether we are achieving anything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee agreed unanimously that the bill needs to ensure that trust money is not given to states, bodies or individuals that are degrading the environment. I will talk more about this in committee. What is the point of rewarding people and states who are obviously doing the wrong thing? Our amendments seek to stamp out rorts of the past and put in place some financial accountability to make sure that decisions are made in a way that is transparent and open and we are able to track where the money is going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We seek to eliminate cost shifting by the states and individuals. I am sure that if Senator Hill would like some advice on cost shifting and what happens, he could talk to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). The funds from the trust should be used to enhance environmental protection undertaken by the states, not substitute for it. Otherwise, the overall pool of money available in this country for the environment will not be increased. Indeed, we will run the risk of less money being available. We also want to see an end to the situation where, on the one hand, money is given for tree planting projects yet, on the other, a state is allowing wholesale land clearing to keep going. In short, as the committee agreed unanimously, this bill requires greater financial and environmental accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not agree, as some have said, that we can work this out as we go and fix it up on the side. These people say, `Don't worry about that, because it will all wash out in the end.' We cannot rely just on partnership agreements drawn up by the states later on. We have to see that in legislation. That would certainly give us the greatest level of accountability. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats propose amendments to this bill aimed to make conservation and the protection of the environment an integral part of the bill. As it stands, the bill is an expensive bandaid, and the focus is on restoration and repair. We need to prevent further destruction. We must also ensure that our environment is protected for future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the Democrats, I will be moving amendments to the bill that seek to remove the Telstra link. We have not given up on that one. I reiterate in this place today that we are opposed, we were always opposed and we will remain opposed to this link. We will see this thing through to its sorry end. While we will not be calling divisions, as the sale bill has already passed, we do not want this to quietly wash past us. I am not going to revisit the debate about the sale of Telstra except to say that I do not think the Australian people were fooled. The government's real agenda is about asset sales and privatisation, not the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this chamber, the minister has said that this government is intent on reinvesting large sums of money in the natural capital of Australia. He has said, rightly, that a lot of major damage has been done to the environment. He has also said, `That is going to take very large sums of money to remedy.' The minister has pontificated loud and long in this place about how important it is to sell one public asset to put a major capital infusion, as he has called it, into our environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I argue that this is not such a major infusion of money as you would like to claim. It will certainly not be enough to protect what we have not yet damaged and rehabilitate what we have degraded. I will be moving an amendment which you, as the Minister for the Environment who has stressed the urgent need for major funding to fix our troubled land, should have no problems with. My amendment would guarantee that 12 per cent of the sale of any Commonwealth asset goes into this natural heritage trust fund. If you really regard the environment as critically important, you will support this amendment, which will ensure that the fund is extended to somewhere
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="773"> near the amount of money that will be required to make a difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have told us for ages that basically everything will be okay when we sell this public asset, Telstra. I have a few  more quotes. You have said, `We care about the environment. We will protect it, but we need to sell the phones to do it.' Senator Hill has had plenty of opportunities to protect the environment which were not dependent on the sale of anything. I will go through a few.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here are a few examples of what you could have done if this government really cared about protecting our environment. You could have acted to protect the world heritage values of the Hinchinbrook Channel, but you neglected to do so. You could have acted to improve Australia's abysmal position at the international climate change negotiations, but you neglected to do so. You neglected Australia's forests by allowing the lifting of the export woodchip quotas. You have failed to protect threatened and endangered species. You have failed to protect Kakadu by not ruling out the Jabiluka mine. Despite your fine words, you have failed to guarantee the protection of our precious wetlands. I will just list a few: Point Lillias, Creery, d'Entrecasteaux and Coongie lakes. It would seem that the only thing you have succeeded in doing is selling Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time to ensure that the money actually goes where you say it should go. This bill was described by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> last week as a bonanza and as the biggest spending spree on the environment in Australia's history. Many of the Democrat amendments to this bill are aimed, firstly, at ensuring that any money goes where it should go, but if we look more closely at what we mean by `bonanza' it is really a mirage. What we have is possibly as much as $80 million a year extra. But there are a variety of things&mdash;and I will go over some of these in more detail at the committee stage&mdash;that are militating against even an extra $80 million being available for the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you made your announcement we were looking at somewhere around $260 million a year being available, but this was predicated on an eight per cent interest rate.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> What we are looking at now is seven per cent and perhaps less. We have already lost at least $32 million a year over four years. I will be asking at the committee stage how we are going to make that money up. In reality, Minister, there is very little extra money being spent compared to what the Labor Party had spent, and a lot less than some of the forecasts of what really should be spent if we are going to make a difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us deal with what money we have; we will argue later about exactly how much that is. We have to make sure that we do not see it disappearing into black or green or whatever coloured holes there are out there to absorb it. We cannot let this become a rampant unaccountable spending spree for those people who paint their pet project green and hope that it will then attract money. This legislation is heavily based on the Landcare model, yet no lessons have been learnt from the Landcare mistakes. Rorting can and does happen, and there are insufficient environmental outcomes. In fact, I understand the Australian National Audit Office has recently produced a report which is very critical of the capacity of the Landcare model to deliver its objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accountability is something we have heard a lot about from this government. You claim to be very concerned about it, so hopefully we will see our amendments supported. Yes, the protection of the environment requires money, but we must make sure it is well spent. I will just run through some of the amendments that I am planning to look at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be moving an amendment designed to eliminate cost shifting by the states. Funds from this trust must be used to enhance environmental protection undertaken by the states&mdash;not substitute for it. We must be concentrating on protection, not just repair. We need to do more than repair the damage done to the environment; we need to stop damaging practices. Democrat amendments will seek to write the protection and conservation of the environment into this bill. They are concepts that are currently lacking. Indeed, I was amazed to see that the word `environment' is largely absent from this bill. For a government that claims to be so con
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="774"> cerned about the environment I am surprised to find that you can hardly bring yourselves to say the word, and therefore a number of our amendments will tackle this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One word that does creep in a lot is `rural'. I cannot think why, but there it is, over and over again. I will be the first person to agree that the agricultural sector is sorely in need of some environment protection measures, but I find the emphasis placed on the rural sector in this bill a little disturbing. We have to look at where the influences are coming from to direct this money. Unless we can change the emphasis&mdash;in other words, move it from primary industries to the environment&mdash;we really should rename the bill and be done with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the preamble of the bill as it stands talks about our rural heartland, it does not even mention the need to protect our seas and our coasts. Nowhere in the bill, for example, is the term `sustainable fisheries' defined. We have  totally ignored the impact that the degradation of our rivers has on our coasts and in turn on the seas around us. Perhaps the government may cry that it is just semantics&mdash;that it is just fooling around with definitions. I will argue very strongly that it is not semantics; it is crucially important that this bill is tightened up. Otherwise we will see the endless arguing by various state and federal bureaucrats about what this bill actually means. If you cannot clearly define the needs of the environment&mdash;I stress again the word `environment' and not `our rural heartland'&mdash;then how can we protect it? If you cannot clearly spell out the measuring sticks by which success or failure of this trust can be measured, then this bill has automatically failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be moving amendments which will clarify and tighten up many of the definitions in this bill, and which will put in place all of those measuring sticks that we need&mdash;measuring sticks against which this fund can be judged; measuring sticks which build on the good work that has already been done. I want to compliment those many individuals, organisations and landcare and conservation groups for the enormous amount of work and effort that has already gone into protecting the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> environment. But they, like us, want to see that work progress and want to be able to stand up and say, `This is what has been achieved; this is what has been done.' </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is how, for example, the aims and objectives contained in the national biodiversity strategy have been met. This is where&mdash;looking at the state of the environment report&mdash;we have actually made some progress. This is what we were trying to do with the fund and this is where we have actually had some success and really achieved something. I find it extraordinary that this bill does not use and include the good work which has already been done on identifying the needs of the environment. I find it extraordinary that, at a time when government is negotiating agreements with COAG on issues such as health or competition policy, where you are putting in  place a system of sanctions and incentives linked to the achievement of performance measures, you have completely failed to put in a similar system here. A similar system must be put in place for the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If competition policy is so important that you can threaten to withhold payments if progress is not made, then why not do that in relation to the environment? If the states do not make progress, why should they keep getting money? If the states are cutting down the trees faster than these programs are putting them up, why should the states be getting any money? If the states are degrading the rivers by failing to put in place other measures, such as sewage treatment works, why should they keep getting money? We have to have some performance measures to actually judge what the states are doing and, as I have said before, they are completely lacking in any clear form in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have drawn on the unanimous report and recommendations from the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee. I stress again here that this is a committee that the government set up, a committee that the government encouraged to travel around the country, a committee that was advised to inform the witnesses that the government would be listening to it. Yet here it seems that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="775"> very few, if any, of the recommendations&mdash;certainly not the major recommendations&mdash;made by this committee are being listened to. Not even the recommendations regarding the way in which the advisory board is to be structured have been taken up by this government. The amendments which we will be moving are very important, looking at how this minister can best draw on the expertise that is out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I have to ask the government: why is it that not even in the area of the advisory board has the government taken up the committee's recommendations? Here I draw the minister's attention particularly to table 1 on page 13 of the committee report, where a possible advisory structure for the Natural Heritage Trust board is set out. It is set out there for very good reason. All of us in this place should be drawing on the experiences of these groups, of experts from the CSIRO, research bodies, conservation groups, departments, land&hyphen;holders, and state and territory governments. A formal system should be put into this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to make sure that those people advising the minister are not just a handful of people from the federal department but people from across the country with a range of experiences&mdash;with expertise in biodiversity, water, soils, vegetation, coasts and marine habitats, atmospheric issues and so on. We could then clearly see the advice that has been given to the minister and look at the decisions that are being made, so that the minister could justify where this money is going, so that we have a transparent process that can track what is being done and what the specific intentions of this bill are. Perhaps these amendments, more than any others, will really signal whether or not this government is interested in protecting the environment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We live on a planet which is in the midst of the greatest environmental crisis since the dinosaurs went to extinction 65 million years ago. The difference between the cataclysm then and the one that the planet is undergoing at the moment is that we know the cause now&mdash;it is us&mdash;and we have a cure now: it is us. But the problem is awesome. It is not a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> problem that we are facing in the future; it is a problem that we are in the midst of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The planet which began with a little over one billion people at the start of this century will end up with six billion people at the end of this century, and faces 10 to 14 billion people aboard during the next century. On top of that is the insatiable human desire, it appears, for the acquisition of more goods, which can come only from one place: the environmental resources&mdash;the natural resources&mdash;of this planet. They are finite. If we put together this population growth with the expected three per cent increase in extraction of resources that this government and other governments around the world would subscribe to, along with everybody catching up with the average Australian's use of resources, by the middle of next century something like 100 times the resources being used now by the human community would have to be available. Well, they are not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something has got to give. If we were to respond to the 1,500 or so world scientists, including 100 Nobel laureates, who warned the world of impending disaster in 1992, the `give' would be being debated in this chamber today. Those scientists made it clear that within 30 or 40 years the planet will not be habitable for many species, and a little further down the line that may well include Homo sapiens&mdash;we human beings ourselves. But, as I have said earlier in this place, the world's attention was almost a yawn at that warning. Had it been a stock exchange collapse, it would have been horror; but since it was just collapse of the world's natural systems, there was a shaking of heads, and demeanour much the same as that of the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) has shown throughout this debate so far&mdash;a staring down at the table, a fiddling with papers and a getting on with other things, because the environment does not really matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people think differently. An opinion poll just last week showed that more Australians were concerned about the environment than they were about the economic welfare and direction of this country. But that will fall on deaf ears to the majority of senators, the majority of parliamentarians, and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="776"> certainly the massive majority of business people&mdash;I am talking in particular about the huge corporations, not least those involved in resource extraction, who have the lion's share of influence on ministers like the Minister for the Environment, who is sitting at the table at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia should be taking a lead to get us out of this cataclysmic situation. Instead of that, we have a fraud in terms of environmental direction and we have that fraud being piloted by none other than the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One only has to look again at some of the actions the minister has taken&mdash;or omitted to take&mdash;in the last 12 months, since he took up this prestigious position as leading environmentalist in the country, to see what a fraud he is and what a fraud his government's policy is. Firstly, let us look at the state of forests and the issue of biodiversity. This minister has been involved in issuing record woodchip licences for the destruction of our forests. I learned just in the last hour that, in the last week or so, his government issued export woodchip licences to some 20 forest destruction companies in Victoria, with no limit on them. How do you ascribe that to a minister for the environment who ought to be concerned about biodiversity, about the loss of species and about what is left of our ancient ecosystems?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same minister has been involved in giving a tick to a go-ahead for the weir on the Queensland Burnett River which, amongst other things, threatens a 400 million&hyphen;year&hyphen;old living fossil&mdash;the Queensland lungfish&mdash;and the endangered elseya tortoise. He has allowed, because he has done nothing, the squalid destruction of native vegetation cover at record levels around this country. In states where there are no controls, like Queensland and Tasmania, this destruction goes on unabated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may well be that this fund&mdash;unregulated as it is&mdash;will actually add impetus to the destruction rather than help to turn it around, because while the fund is giving some $250 million for replanting and fixing up the damage of the past, at the same time it is only setting aside some $64 million to save what
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we have left of the natural vegetation cover in this country. In Queensland, we know that last year alone 100 hectares of natural vegetation was licensed to be scalped off the face of the earth&mdash;with the intention of it being forever&mdash;under state government approval, with this minister for the environment and this Howard government doing nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to Australia's pretty proud record on the protection of world heritage areas, what has happened with this minister? He has given the go-ahead for `experimental fishing' on pristine coral reefs of the Great Barrier Reef. He is lining himself up through a process that is now under way to allow mining for more uranium in, amongst other places, the heartland of Kakadu&mdash;the Jabiluka valley. The personal gut reaction of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) against uranium mining at Kakadu has not been enough to allow that process to stop; nor has it been enough for this minister for the environment to assert that it would not go ahead against the wishes of the traditional owners, who are dead set against Jabiluka but who have no power to stop the force and impetus of the process which this minister is driving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for the Environment has also given the go&hyphen;ahead for this obscene Williams resort at Hinchinbrook, with its threat to the dugong and to the natural systems of the Hinchinbrook Channel and beyond. The minister shakes his head because he does not believe that licensing 250 power boats in the channel threatens dugong at all.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, they shake their little environment heads and laugh. We will try to excuse the action up there, which is being driven by this minister who is essentially a minister against the environment rather than for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have the massive increased exploitation of Antarctic fisheries. While we are speaking of that region, the minister's current attitude is to sit on his hands while a ship carrying a huge amount of high radiation dose nuclear waste is floating south of this continent. Australia is the only country in the region not uttering a word of protest and the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="777"> Australian government is the only one in the region that is not moving to track that ship. It was good enough for Portugal, Spain and South Africa to send out naval vessels and planes. This government is aiding and abetting that ship, knowing that in the future there will be dozens more ships with bigger cargoes of radioactive waste coming in this direction, because they do not want a public debate. The minister, who has now left the chamber, does not want a public debate on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at this bill, we find that there is an allocation of some $1.1 billion&mdash;or $1.25 billion, if you add interest&mdash;over five years to the environment. But to put this allocation into some perspective, it has to be set against budget allocations over the same five years of some three&hyphen;quarters of a trillion dollars. As Senator Faulkner, for Labor, said a little earlier, when you get down to a real analysis, you find that the majority of that money has already been left by the backstepping of this government in cutting funding to the department of the environment and in reducing the environmental wherewithal of the government over the whole spectrum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the problems with the slush fund which this Natural Heritage Trust fund will become? The first and foremost problem is the so-called board. The board consists of this minister against the environment and, from another place, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, whose record on the environment is no better than Senator Hill's and whose record against the environment is no better. One cannot escape the reality that this money, which is in the hands of these two people for disbursement, is not going to match the cost to the environment and to the Australian nation of the decision making against the environment on a whole range of issues that we are engaged in at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But even if these ministers were competent environmentalists, there is a problem with a board consisting of two people looking at each other over a table and saying, `Here is how we will cut it up.' As previous speakers have said, if this board is to function, we need environmental expertise, of which these ministers have shown they have none. I will
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be moving some 20 amendments on behalf of the Australian Greens and supporting amendments from other parties&mdash;amendments which are going to help tighten up the disbursement of these funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that this board should at least be made up of nine experts in the fields of biodiversity, Australian indigenous heritage issues, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander expertise, marine conservation, wilderness conservation, world heritage, arid lands, soil conservation, inland waters, community consultation and communications. The people appointed to the board ought to have a clear and apparent working knowledge of and expertise in those areas, with annual reports coming to the minister and a charter of responsibilities including the objectives of protecting and conserving Australia's natural environment and assisting the Australian government in implementing Australia's obligations under international conventions for the protection of the environment, including world heritage, Ramsar, climate change and biodiversity conventions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can you imagine this Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, moving on this board to use the obligations of the country under international treaties such as world heritage or climate change? It goes against the whole tenor of his actions&mdash;his anti-environmental actions. The public can have no faith in he and the agriculture minister being the board. I hope that the Independents&mdash;Senator Harradine and Senator Colston&mdash;will, as a minimum safeguard on this money, be voting to support the very responsible concept of a board which is made up of environmental expertise to look at the disbursement of this money.</PARA>

While I have been sitting here today I have received another call which tells us what is going to happen at the Tasmanian level. Read `other states' if you will, but I am going to tell you in two minutes about my home state. The advisory group set up to look at the disbursement of the so-called Harradine moneys and the so&hyphen;called Telstra funding is not going to be set up in the Department of Environment and Land Management; it is being set up in the Premier's department. This is to disburse environmental funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Key to that group is Mr Ken Felton. He is being seconded from Forestry Tasmania. He has a long career with Forestry Tasmania, previously called the Forestry Commission of Tasmania, which is notorious around this country for its destruction of the natural heritage of our state, including world heritage forests, wildlife and national estate forests. Ken Felton, who is being appointed to this group, has been central to riding over environmental considerations. He was central to the Forestry Commission's push during the period of the Helsham inquiry at the end of the 1980s to destroy the campaigning of environmentalists so that he and the Forestry Commission could destroy key parts of Tasmania's internationally renowned forests, including, I reiterate, world heritage forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is a man who was not in favour of saving the Franklin River. Here is a man who fought to prevent the Great Western Tiers going into a world heritage area. Here is a man who fought to see that the world heritage east Picton forests and forests in the Huon Valley and the Well Valley went to the woodchippers instead of into protection so that their wildlife and world heritage values could be there for the inestimable enjoyment of, and value to, not just us but also future generations and the plethora of our fellow species
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which, until his imprimatur went on it, were safe in the fastness of those forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the whole fabric of the disbursement of these funds at federal and state levels is riddled with a growing edifice of anti&hyphen;environmentalism&mdash;not just neutrality, but the face set against saving the environment. Under those circumstances, we are going to see those funds rorted. They are going to go to greenwashing. They are even going to go, under the current terms of this legislation, to resource management. What does that mean? It means to me mining, logging, super&hyphen;fishing&mdash;it could mean anything. It simply means that the gates are open to whatever you like and the hands will be in the pockets. It is not enough for this fund to be subject to the influence at state and federal levels of people whose face is set against the environment, if you ask me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very telling test of the Senate. Is the Senate going to simply leave this situation, which we already know is going to come up with outcomes against the best interests of the environment and which is going to ensure that the dollars available are not spent in the best way possible; or is the Senate going to act as a house of review, and, dare I say, in the states' interests, to ensure that some mechanism is put in place as a safeguard against rorting occurring, against this money being wasted and against this money being put into pursuits which are against the interests of the environment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a real test on this place in the next 24 hours. Are the Independent senators going to stand with the rest of this Senate to ensure that we do amend this fraught, fraudulent piece of legislation in terms of its potential outcome? Are they going to make sure that we put in place accountability? That is the least we can do, not just in the interests of the environment but in the interests of the Australian people to whose detriment this Telstra sale trust fund will have been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The loss of Telstra will be a financial and service detriment which will be compounded by a massive wasting of money in an age where every dollar&mdash;few as they are&mdash;for the environment should go to servicing the

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The passage of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill through parliament has been fraught with controversy, and justifiably so. This is primarily because of the link with the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill. As we have already heard from my colleagues on this side of the chamber, this bill has a number of significant flaws which need to be specifically addressed via amendment in the committee stage of this debate. Despite supporting this bill, we believe there is a need for quite a comprehensive series of amendments to ensure that there is adequate parliamentary scrutiny of the bill and  government accountability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is necessary to put this bill into its political context. Leading up to the 1996 election, the Liberal Party, like all oppositions, was serious about winning. But they did have a serious credibility problem in a large number of policy areas&mdash;one such area being their environment policy. It seemed obvious that the Liberal coalition needed to be a bit clearer about the environment and many in the community, particularly those of younger voters, were looking very closely at what was on offer from both major parties during the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that there was a lack of Liberal credibility in this area because under a coalition government there would have been mining at Coronation Hill, the wet tropics would have been logged and the Franklin River would have been flooded. Labor always led on the environment and the coalition in opposition either obstructed at worst or reluctantly followed Labor's lead at the best when new environment initiatives were being pursued. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The creation of the link between environment funding and the partial sale of Telstra was seen by the community at large as a blatant blackmail device&mdash;a gimmick that achieved much in muddying the waters and muddying the parameters of the public debate surrounding the partial sell&hyphen;off of Australia's telecommunications infrastructure as well as creating the impression that the Liberals had at least considered the environment in policy terms. In an era where perception is crucial, the community could be forgiven for making the mental connection between the coalition's Natural Heritage Trust every time Telstra was mentioned, giving rise to the notion that the environment policy of the Liberals could in some way possibly be compared to Labor's record of commitment in this fundamental area of policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, but to the surprise of no-one on this side of the chamber, we all soon learned exactly how and why the link between the Telstra sale and the Natural Heritage Trust or environment policy was forged, thanks to a senior government adviser who was so disgusted with the cynicism of the exercise that he decided to speak out. As my colleague Senator Faulkner has already mentioned, in an article published in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">SciTech</EMPHASIS> in October last year, this adviser is quoted as saying that the Natural Heritage Trust is a `blatant fraud'. He goes on to say that it was indeed devised as a purely political exercise and was openly joked about in the ranks of the coalition, but behind closed doors of course. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">We are appalled at the lies and deception involved with this issue, it is an exercise based on just one thing&mdash;finding a way to sell off Telstra.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This shows that even if there were merit in the funding outcomes of the deal, then the motivation certainly did not arise from any commitment to environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This point was reinforced by the Minister for the Environment, Senator Robert Hill. In the closing paragraph of his second reading speech on tabling of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill in this place he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The investment proposed in this Bill, which will be made possible by the partial privatisation of Telstra, will reverse the long term depreciation of natural capital.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="780">  </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The lack of commitment was exposed by the minister again in the mechanism used to refer the bill to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee. He referred the bill to that committee knowing that it had been put together hastily. The Selection of Bills Committee report of 25 June 1996 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Government wishes to put the provisions of the bill to those who have an interest in it as part of the consultative process during the Senate's consideration of the bill.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I will quote an extract from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  from a public hearing during the inquiry which sums up, I believe, exactly where the minister stood and where this legislation stood in coalition's legislation drafting priority list. The government chairperson said, in allowing a senator to pose a rhetorical question at the inquiry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">I think this is a little different from some legislation. The Minister has actually indicated in the reference to the committee that it was to be a form of public debate rather than set in concrete. The Minister has said that he is open to suggestions by the very way in which the bill was referred to this committee. All those issues you have raised and the suggestions obviously will be looked at and responded to, no doubt, when we write our report.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In essence, the government used the referral to the committee as a way of seeking substance to their policy, and the necessary adjustments to the bill would theoretically make the trust workable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is an indictment of the government that it has not in fact chosen to acknowledge the recommendations of the committee despite the noble words of the chair at the time and despite the very inclusive reference that the minister made in the first place. Despite all the work with the witnesses and the very sincere words from many members of that committee, including government members, not one of these recommendations of substance have been considered by the government at this point. All we have is a token amendment put forward that changes the name of the proposed board. It is now a ministerial board as opposed to a board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need look no further than the government's current environmental record to dispel any doubt about their lack of commitment. During the election campaign the government
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> promised to match Labor's spending on the environment and that funding for the Natural Heritage Trust would come on top of this expenditure. They were very specific: they said that the funding would be additional to Labor's budgeted funding for the environment and sustainable agricultural elements of the primary industry portfolio, clearly defining both the environment and Australia's and DPIE's contributions to environment and land management programs. Instead, we find&mdash;just one of many broken promises&mdash;that funding to these environment programs was actually reduced overall by 13 per cent. On further analysis of the spread of the Natural Heritage Trust fund over the proposed five years of its operation, and taking into account this portfolio reduction, the coalition is offering a mere $84.3 million over and above what the former Labor government had already committed from consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This extraordinary figure highlights the extent to which the government has capitalised on the gimmick value of the $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust, which implies a massive investment when, in fact, only a relatively modest increase has been supplied. To look at it another way, the partial sale of Telstra will cause a one&hyphen;third reduction in the dividend payable by Telstra to the government each year. Last year that dividend, in real terms, was getting up towards $1 billion. Putting aside the fact that the dividend will be likely to increase overall, simplistically the reduction in revenue to the federal government as a result of the partial sale of Telstra could be roughly one&hyphen;third or $300 million per annum. So, each year, additional funding for the environment of $84.3 million is going to cost taxpayers $300 million in revenue that would have come via the Telstra dividend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us take an example of how these changes apply to just one program: revegetation. Given that to fence and revegetate a degraded area costs about $600 a hectare&mdash;I have those figures from additional information to the Environment, Recreation and Community Affairs estimates of November 1996&mdash;and one&hyphen;third of this under the government's proposal will be funded by the community, under the current project funding ratios this
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="781"> additional funding will only cover the protection of 210,000 hectares of land. This is an absolutely minuscule proportion of the degraded land that needs urgent rehabilitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we find again when we look a bit closer is that the cuts to this year's funding for that particular initiative&mdash;landcare in the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin&mdash;is down $76 million. Is this right? Is it fair? I do not believe so. It is just the way this government does business. It makes a mockery of any words this government utters about their commitment to the environment and it exposes the gimmick that the Natural Heritage Trust is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support my colleagues who have spoken on this debate so far in labelling this particular Natural Heritage Trust as a Liberal slush fund. To change it will require quite significant amendments to improve accountability, parliamentary scrutiny and board structure. Unless those amendments occur then this Natural Heritage Trust will not get beyond being a gimmick and a fund set up to allow the Liberals to make the political appropriations to the environment programs that they see fit.</PARA></SPEECH>

There are two hands working here: one hand is pretending to put money into the environment, the other is pulling money out. There is certainly going to be a problem at the end of five years and there will be problems in between in relation to accountability. This is really interesting considering what the coalition said about accountability in relation to social security, to those people who may make technical errors on their forms and get taken off the dole with no means of support because of those technical errors. That is accountability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But where is the accountability for hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money?
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> And it was taxpayers' money that was built up in the original Telstra. Perhaps that is going to be handled in an unaccountable way: not accountable to the environment, and not accountable to the areas where people are prepared for spending and believe the government should be spending taxpayers' money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no reason why the environment should be singled out as an area which needs to be funded in a different way from other important areas. But the government has chosen the environment because they know a lot of people are concerned about it. They have also separated out the environment and said, `We will be able to use the environment, perhaps at the end of five years, as a means of selling off something else.' That is, if there is anything left to sell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the real national accounts saying? They are saying that we are creating environmental debt every year. What are the government doing about that environment debt? Very little, actually. When you think about it, their policies are tending to reward people who create environmental debt. We do not have to look very much further than income tax bill no. 2, which is coming up on the program and which says the government want to treat the construction of tailings dams as being in the same tax deductibility category as rehabilitation. Terrific! You only have to look at the goldfields around Laverton and Leonora to see what an environmental scourge many tailings dams continue to be. You have only to look around uranium mines to see what an incredible problem they are. There is hardly such a thing as a tailings dam which does not leak, resulting in problems for the water supply, community concern and problems for the animals that happen to go into areas which will perpetually be a lens for water to be evaporated into the environment. And the government is planning to make this tax deductible as rehabilitation. That is what this government is doing in relation to the environment. They are helping to create environmental debt. They are helping the situation, which I have mentioned on several occasions, where the environment and the community have been asked to subsidise resource extraction industries.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="782">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report on subsidies for the use of natural resources has still not been tabled in the parliament&mdash;at least not that I have seen. Yet it was `Environment economics research paper No. 2' which indicated that there was $7.746 billion to $8.866 billion per year in environmental subsidies&mdash;this does not even include mining&mdash;being paid by the community every year to subsidise industry. So, in relation to the relative amounts, we are talking about peanuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is allowing the community and the environment to build up environmental debt in order to subsidise the profits of, often, big industry. It is very interesting in that sense, because we just found out last week that the mining industry is having record profit levels. As far as the coalition is concerned, that is all right as long as the environment and the taxpayer continue to subsidise that profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to make sure that policies of ecological sustainability address the problem of the building up of environmental debt and reverse it, not just with bandaids but with tax, trade, industry and competition policies. We have to look at every single example so far where those issues have come up in legislation. Look at what the coalition have said in relation to tax policies. I have just mentioned income tax bill No. 2, where they are saying, `Treat the construction of tailings dams as environmental rehabilitation.' What a farce!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at industry policy. Look at trade policy. Look at the fact that competition policy is sifting through every state law and local ordinance to see how they comply or do not comply with competition policy. I was shown a page on that&mdash;I am afraid I do not have it with me&mdash;which says that ordinances or laws which allow people to require that child&hyphen;care facilities are not sited next to toxic waste dumps may be an infringement of competition policy. That is where we have got to at the moment: people do not even have the ability to choose that the siting of a child&hyphen;care facility be not next to a chemical facility which might damage the health of small children, as this may be an interruption of competition. It is not good enough. We have to start looking at the general environmental
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sustainability instead of building up this environmental debt. That is why this government has absolutely no credibility in relation to this fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the level of environmental debt now? We need look only at salinity and at the water quality of rivers and coasts. There are huge problems involved with water quality, environmental costs, land degradation, continued land clearance, and environmental debt involved with air pollution. You have only to look at the air quality of my capital city, Perth, in Western Australia to see what is happening with air pollution and the health problems associated with that. The problems of pollution include tailings dams, eutrophication of our river systems and the costs, present and future, of this continual damage to the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are being told that we are going to be looking at the real costs and addressing some of these problems. So what we have to be doing is building the solutions, building the way out into all policy areas. But, no, the government says, `We do not want environment in trade. We do not want environment put into the Trade Practices Act.' We are in the middle of debate in the committee stage on the Trade Practices Amendment (Industry Access Codes) Bill. But, no, the government does not want ecological sustainability in the Trade Practices Act because that would be too prescriptive. Heavens no! It wants to be able to have the status quo; that is, whatever the government thinks it can get away with. It would like to think that that is all we need. This government has no credibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Competition policy was set up by the Labor Party. They have a lot to answer for in relation to what is happening on the ground both at the federal level and at the state and local levels in relation to competition policy, in terms of public interest and in terms of ecological sustainability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On an annual basis, how can you compare the amount of money, this perception of environmental expenditure, which will in fact not be administered solely by the Minister for the Environment, will not be overseen by any independent sources and will not be accountable to the environment, but will only be
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="783"> politically accountable&mdash;a whiteboard like you have never seen before!&mdash;to the annual damage that is happening and will continue to happen in the absence of any real industry policies on greenhouse? What is the cost now? What is the cost in the future? What are we doing about it? I will tell you what we are doing about it. We are pushing for coal sales not only in our country but across the world. We have a minister who thinks that gas is not a fossil fuel. We have people who think that, somehow or other, you can leave the word `ecologically' out of ecologically sustainable development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what we have at the moment and that is why this farce is unacceptable. It should be exposed. I am very much looking forward to the committee stage of the bill to see what changes can be brought to bear to make this part of the farce at least a little bit of an accountable farce rather than a total farce.</PARA>

Minister, exactly how many students or potential students eligible for Austudy have been affected by your ill&hyphen;thought out actual means test changes? Will you compensate students who are now considered eligible for Austudy and who have reconsidered their enrolment and therefore may have to pay late enrolment fees or will your department waive late enrolment fees?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to your last question, Senator Carr, I can assure you that the new secretary to the department&mdash;the new FAS in that area&mdash;has been quite literally burning the midnight oil to try to remedy this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> problem. It is very important to understand that the actual means test has not changed. The levels at which people will get Austudy remain the same and the amounts of Austudy people will get remain the same. Regrettably, in the implementation of the changes to the means test, one method in particular was used which I believe has turned out, as I indicated in my press release, to unfairly disadvantage applicants. The reason for that is that the applicants would have either been rejected completely for Austudy or had reduced Austudy and, nonetheless, been able to get it on review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me quite inappropriate when it is clear that the administrative mechanisms for weeding out the cheats have also caught a number of genuine, needy applicants, to make those genuine, needy applicants wait for a review. For that reason I have instructed the department to change the arrangements by which they were assessing applicants&mdash;and to do so very quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You asked me about the number who might be affected. It relates to the imputed expenditure aspect of the means test. I understand that as at the end of January just over 17,000 applicants have been processed. That number is quite small in relation to the total number of Austudy applicants. As you might know, Senator Carr, but a lot of other people would not, of over 520,000 people who are expected to apply for Austudy, over 400,000 or about 80 per cent would never do a means test in any event. Those people are simply not a part of this administrative difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only about 120,000 will have to do a means test and 80 per cent of those are expected to be eligible for some or all Austudy in any event and only about 24,000, or 4.5 per cent of all Austudy applicants, are expected to be ineligible. Of those affected by the inappropriately high imputation figures, 7,307 of those 17,000&mdash;a number quite distant from the 83,000 you read about in the paper today&mdash;lost some benefit. Of those, only 2,817 lost more than $1,000, including 58 who lost more than $4,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the imputation the problem is a lot smaller than many people would imagine. I conclude by saying that I am very 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="784"> pleased to see that some universities are advertising that they have additional places and indicating that they will waive late fees. We have no figures yet on how many people might have decided to discontinue study because they were getting, for example, $20 a week less than they would otherwise have anticipated.</PARA></ANSWER>

The area you are talking about, Senator Cooney, is clearly a crossover area between the two levels of government.

That was all about the fact that a nursing home on the central coast of New South Wales had complained to her about what she had actually put in her newsletter. The situation is that once again we have just got another newsletter as bad. One has to wonder: is this a campaign of dishonesty being run by Labor?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, I am glad you asked that question because it gives me the opportunity to reinforce a point that I made to you earlier&mdash;that is, that the actual means test was first introduced by Labor, supported by us and refined by us for a specific purpose. People who have companies, trusts, partnerships and small businesses have the opportunity, quite legally, to minimise their taxable income and have their sons and daughters at university on Austudy while the sons and daughters of PAYE earners, who were just above the Austudy cut&hyphen;off limits, would not get Austudy. The purpose was to ensure that that situation was fixed. That was an unfair situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On both sides of the chamber we agreed that that needed to be fixed. You introduced a form of actual means test which basically calculated what someone's means were, if I can put it in short form, by imputing an income on the basis of assets held. We thought that was far too arbitrary and that it could be refined to give people the opportunity to declare what their expenditures were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Senator Faulkner had bothered to read the press release I put out he would have seen that I tried to go over every error that there possibly could be to maximise the opportunity for the needy, not the greedy, families to get Austudy. One of the problems was that the estimated expenditures put in by Austudy applicants were run passed ABS figures to check their expected expenditures. Where the claimed expenditures were lower than the ABS expenditures they were imputed up to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="796"> the ABS expenditure level. The error was that the ABS expenditures were set far too high. If the ABS expenditures had been set at reasonable levels for Austudy applicants that would have been a perfectly sensible check to run against self&hyphen;declared assessments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You were not prepared to go to self&hyphen;declared assessments, but we were. The department instituted that mechanism as a test of whether people were lying. I am sure Senator Faulkner knows that if you give some people an opportunity to get Commonwealth money, they will take it and they will not always tell the truth. If, as I indicated to you, those ABS expenditure levels had been set at reasonable levels for Austudy applicants it would have been a reasonable check. They were not. They were set too high. Consequently, we were catching more people than we should have. I believe we were catching the needy. This gives me the opportunity to answer a question raised by Senator Stott Despoja in one of her press releases.</PARA>

Senator Stott Despoja asserted that this blew the budget out of the water. In fact, it does not. By easing the administration of the test because we were catching more people than we had intended we will simply come back to about the same budget savings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government wants to get its budget savings, yes, but where it is apparent that the implementation of a test is catching more people than intend, producing more savings than were budgeted for and causing unnecessary hardship to needy people, then it is sensible for a minister to say, `This has to be turned around so that the needy people can get it.' We will stick with an actual means test because we want to give Austudy to the needy not the greedy. In that sense, we are the same as you.</PARA></ANSWER>

Some of them have to make decisions to move from country areas into towns or from one town to another. All these decisions have been affected by your inept administration and your inept policy.

This is what the ombudsman found about Labor's administration of the scheme:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">That was the problem under Labor two years ago. At the time, the Senate quite rightly agreed to set up a major inquiry into the Labor government's maladministration of Austudy after 13 years. I will read the first term of reference:</PARA>

In the very dying days of the Labor government, they decided finally&mdash;after 13 years&mdash;that they might move away from a taxable income base eligibility which was creating enormous inconsistencies for eligibility to Austudy. Obviously, this problem is going to take a fair bit of time to bed down. We are, as mentioned by the minister in her answer, dealing with 500,000 students in the Austudy system, both at the secondary and tertiary levels. Eighty per cent of these go straight through, but 20 per cent come under scrutiny for eligibility. Twenty per cent is no mean number: we are talking about up to 100,000 people who might be examined, and there are obviously going to be problems.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is there anyone in the Senate who, on the evidence that has been put before us, would disagree with that proposition? Not one person in the Senate would be able to contest the idea that there has been great incompetence in the administration of this portfolio. The only issue is: who is responsible for that? Is it the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) or, as she says, her public servants?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister today was trying to present to us the notion that, somehow or other, as a result of her actions in mitigating the actual means test there will be less impact on the people of this country. What must be understood by all those who actually take an interest in this matter is that this is, at core, a policy issue. It is a failure of policy as far as this government is concerned and no amount of blaming the victim and no amount of blaming officers in her department can detract from that simple proposition. This is a failure of public policy&mdash;her failure as the responsible minister in this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She tried to tell the Senate that this is a proposition that will affect fewer people&mdash;some 17,000 applicants, she said. Her own department provided to the estimates committees answers which indicated that some 13,100 persons would be directly affected by the measures taken in this budget&mdash;some 7,070 females and 6,030 males would be affected as a direct result of this government's actions in tightening the Austudy actual means test&mdash;and that there would be an attempt to raise some $60 million in the first year of the operations of this particular budget measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has to be seen in the context of government actions which are aimed at securing some $527 million out of the student assistance programs which, as the minister knows, will affect one in five students. One in five students will be adversely affected by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the actions that this government has taken in terms of student assistance. The particular measures that relate to Austudy and the tightening of the actual means test involve some $216 million of the total $527 million that this government is seeking to secure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 71,000 students will be directly affected in terms of loss of benefits or reduction in their benefits as a direct result of this government's action&mdash;not just the 17,000 that she suggested in the Senate today. That is of course on top of the 10,800 persons who were ineligible under the original 1996 actual means tested measures. This of course brings you to the figure of some 24,000 that the minister quoted in her answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposition that the minister put to the Senate&mdash;that her actions were actually lessening the impact of the decisions being taken by this government&mdash;needs to be seen in the context of the decisions being taken by this government. We have seen arrangements outlined in a 36&hyphen;page booklet to applicants involving the filling out of a form some 17 pages long. These arrangements are so complex and so complicated that the minister was forced to employ an additional 60 people to staff the actual Austudy means test hotline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is so complicated that, as we all know, as a result of backbench pressure&mdash;engineered, I would put to the Senate, as a direct result of the rivalry from, and the undermining of her within her government by, her junior portfolio&mdash;and as a direct result of the action taken in the Senate and through the estimates committee process, she has been obliged to do a humiliating backflip. The essential policy in which she was operating has not changed. And that is the critical issue here. No matter how she masquerades around the Senate to suggest that her officers were responsible, the critical issue, the policy failure which is at the core of this problem, remains the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government intent upon ripping out of the education system in this country some $1.8 billion. These sorts of fiascos are direct results of the heartless, inhuman and philosophically flawed attitude that this government has embarked upon in an attempt to secure budgetary outcomes, not educational outcomes, that are designed to ensure that we

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is typical of Senator Crowley to raise a red herring to try and get an inadequate former Labor government off the hook. The Labor Party cannot tolerate the fact that they were thrown out comprehensively almost one year ago. The fact is that when the Labor Party introduced the AMT, and we supported the principle, Senator Faulkner actually said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the actual means test is a fair, equitable and cost effective method of ensuring that Austudy assistance is provided only to genuinely needy families.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Many families who were not genuinely needy were actually getting Austudy. One of the things that the Labor Party consistently failed to do was to stop people fraudulently claiming benefits from the taxpayer. Look at what 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator Newman has been able to do in the Department of Social Security in 12 months, in stopping the fraudulent payments that the Labor Party failed to stop in 13 years. We are in a situation where the Labor Party introduced the AMT. They said it was to be properly directed. They did not ensure that it was properly directed. They did not ensure that people who were not entitled to receive Austudy did not obtain it. This government has taken on the principle of making sure that some changes are made to the policy behind the actual means test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The major change to the policy was to base the assessment of an applicant's AMT on their actual means rather than on taxable income. This is required for comparative equity with PAYE taxpayers. Why didn't the Labor Party ensure that there was such equity? Why did they walk away from that responsibility? They did not care less that people getting this payment were not entitled to it. We would be forgiven for believing, from what we have heard from the Labor Party today, that the policy has been changed by the minister. That policy has not been changed by the minister. The changes purely and simply relate to administration and customer service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Carr stood up here a moment ago and talked about the fact that the minister had the temerity to appoint 60 extra staff within the department to deal with a lot of the inquiries. He should be congratulating the minister for making sure that people were actually getting service. A lot of the government departments prior to the change of government last year were understaffed. But what happened? The previous government did not recognise any of those problems. Minister Vanstone has ensured that those problems have been addressed and she should be congratulated. Instead, the Labor Party are in their typical negative mode: everything is wrong. They cannot find any merit in anything that this government is doing, and this is but another example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The government has moved very swiftly to remove any anomalies that have been detected over the last few months by dispensing with the automatic imputation system. Once again, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="801"> you would think that the opposition would be pleased that anomalies such as this have been removed. You would think that the minister's swift movement in this area would be cause for congratulations. No, they want to abuse and accuse in their now traditional way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a great shame that the Labor Party cannot accept that there are some things that need to be done in the national interest. They should have been able to identify the people previously getting Austudy who were not entitled to receive it. They should stand condemned for imposing heavier taxes on people in order to supply funds to others who did not need them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Knowles has said that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) acted swiftly. What rot. Absolutely false. The Australian Democrats and, I believe, many other people in this place, including Senator Harradine, have been aware of the difficulties and have had concerns about the administration of the actual means test since last year. We raised them in estimates in November. We raised them with the department in briefings in December. We got on to departments, welfare officers and the minister over the last few months. For the minister to have acted 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> swiftly would have meant getting in on the first round of enrolment offers, not the third round and after enrolments have closed on most campuses around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Carr failed to mention the actual costs of enrolment late fees and charges. Students who want to enrol now on university campuses around Australia&mdash;assuming they are even considered, let alone accepted&mdash;face late enrolment fees of at least $60 on most campuses and up to $100 on other campuses around this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make the point very clearly that many people in this place, but specifically the Democrats, did not beat up this issue last year. We did not beat up this issue this year either. We have been working very quietly, constructively and cooperatively behind the scenes with departmental officials as well as with people from the minister's office and people from campuses and institutions around this nation. Unfortunately, that did not seem to work. The minister has acted, but it is too little too late. For the minister to say last week, `Hang in there students, hang on,' when many have dropped out already, is not only lamentable but absolutely shameful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Austudy in this country is characterised by stringent eligibility criteria&mdash;incredibly harsh&mdash;introduced not only by this government but by the former government. They are culpable too. When we talk about ineffective or incompetent education ministers, we should look back to the record of ALP too. We should examine the kind of changes introduced by people like former ministers Dawkins and Ryan. They introduced fees and charges. They are as culpable for creating a user pays education system in this country as the minister is today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only are there problems with Austudy overall and the fact that average students who receive Austudy are living on 35 per cent of poverty line, but the actual means test system has been chaotic and ineffectual. Certainly, Senator Crowley is correct: the AMT that is operating now is different from the one suggested by the former government. Anyone who has any understanding of education issues in this parliament would know that. The other question I have for the minister is: 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="802"> who chose the ABS figures? It had to be either the minister or her department who determined how the AMT would operate and what figures would be used to determine the imputations.</PARA>

The department&mdash;and I am sure they did&mdash;and certainly the minister, and I am sure she did not, should have anticipated the difficulties with the operation of the scheme and the need for many more people on the hotline to avoid such chaos. I also put to the minister the promise of her predecessor; that is, the former shadow minister, Senator Hill. When he was education spokesperson for the coalition he promised to review the AMT guidelines. I want to know whether the government is going to stick to that promise because that is what it promised to do.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to add my thoughts to the taking note of this answer by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone. The first thing that needs to be said is that the minister has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> apologised for getting it wrong so it is beyond dispute that a gross error has been made&mdash;and the minister has owned that. In fact, she has boasted about her being able to apologise. That makes her better, apparently, than other people who did not apologise. Perhaps other people did not apologise because they had not made mistakes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one thing we can be clear about is that Minister Vanstone has apologised&mdash;and why? Because she got it grossly wrong. Thousands of youngsters and even not so young people lining up for university this year have been told that they are ineligible for Austudy or even part of Austudy. The figures for those who have been so appalling disadvantaged vary between 17,000, 24,000 and 90,000. But what we know is that all those people have now got terrible decisions to make in terms of whether they will be able to take university places this year, whether they will be able to make the necessary arrangements and whether they will be able to find the money to pay the late enrolment fee if their university does not waive that fee.

Thousands and thousands of people have been placed in terrible hardship all because of the minister's incompetence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do support Senator Stott Despoja's remarks that this minister acted very slowly and was loathe to act. As Senator Carr said, she did not act until the outrage on her own Liberal backbench forced her to act. The complaints have been coming through to the minister's office and to the department for many months now. We all know that you do not complain in January or February about Austudy for that year; you have to make sure that these situations are sorted out in Novem 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="803"> ber and December. What sort of defence is it to say that there have been problems in the past? The problem we are dealing with is this Minister Vanstone's incompetence in 1997; that is what we are dealing with. Thousands of Australians have been hideously disadvantaged because of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important thing is that this minister wants to boast she has been successful because she has removed $4.5 billion&mdash;B for Betty billion dollars&mdash;from her portfolio. What a strange boast. What is more, her Prime Minister, Mr Howard, sent her French champagne to congratulate her. One of the reasons she has been able to cut that amount is that she has cut the Public Service staff numbers in the department. Her department's staff numbers have been savagely cut back. If there were problems there before, they will only be compounded by this minister's behaviour in terms of staffing. She said to us that when she heard that the problem was there she rushed some more staff out. Jolly good, Minister, where did you find them? Did they have to be brought into the department and retrained because you had sent most of them packing under Mr Howard's proposal to dramatically root out the Public Service? Savage cuts in the public sector and savage cuts in that department meant that when there were incompetencies or mistakes being made in Austudy, the departmental people were not even there to oversee and implement the changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has apologised because she got it wrong and the only defence she can think of is that if she goes out and apologises perhaps people will say, `At least she is not too bad; at least she admits it.' Let us not forget what is at issue: the minister admits that she got it wrong. She admits she was wrong in Austudy and the changes she introduced were too hard, too savage and too damaging for over 20,000&mdash;as a conservative estimate&mdash;young Australians who now may not find a place this year. It puts their whole lives on hold for 12 months.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">It is claimed that:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="805">  </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1994 the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade published a report in which it wrote of "the debate over the conflict between the economic benefits of defence exports and the moral and strategic concerns at trade in arms". This was a critical debate, but one in which the major parties ensured that the economic benefits of the arms trade were given more weight than any consideration of human rights abuses. Following this Report, House of Representatives and Labor Party member Gary D. Gibson initiated a correction to what he (and I) believe to be an imbalance in the Report. We were concerned about the social effects of defence cooperation agreements and arms transfers. My legislation revises the Defence Cooperation Control Bill 1995 introduced by Gary Gibson in the House of Representatives on 24 August 1995. The original bill was concerned with consideration of human rights before Australia made defence cooperation agreements with other countries. My legislation will include those concerns and add others. A review of past Australian arm sales and Defence Cooperation agreements is pertinent.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Robert Ray, then Minister for Defence, on 24 April, 1990 announced the sale of all of the obsolete Mirage III fighters and ancillary equipment for $36 million. After the sale announcement, the shadow minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade said, "India and Pakistan have already fought two wars over Kashmir, a well&hyphen;known and on&hyphen;going flash&hyphen;point between the two countries. The sale at this time indicates either a failure to understand or an indifference to&hyphen;regional sensitivities." Answering critics of the sale, Neal Blewett, then Australia's acting Foreign Affairs Minister pointed out on ABC radio that the contract would be reviewed if there were an outbreak of hostilities. Recognising that an outbreak of hostilities might occur and that the sale might contribute to such an outbreak made the sale questionable from the start.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In early October 1990 the United States government suspended both civilian aid to Pakistan and provision of military equipment because of the apparent Pakistan nuclear weapons program. In answer to a question without notice then Foreign Minister Evans said that the Mirages, "have not yet been shipped". Since the jets were being loaded on to the Pakistani ship MV Makran this was not so. Pressed, Evans `frankly acknowledged' he was wrong. Members of the cabinet decided to sell death&hyphen;dealing merchandise without even knowing the facts. In February 1991, the Defence Minister claimed weapons sales to Israel and the Middle 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> East were banned and the value of such exports was about $300 million per year. Official statistics available at the time showed the trade was less than $157 million per year and that Australia had exported military material to Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">India now saw Australia as a previously neutral power tilting to Pakistan. For $36 million, Australia jeopardised an Indian trade of $870 million per year, added to regional tensions, created problems between itself and its American ally and negated Prime Minister Hawke's initiatives to improve relations with India.</PARA>

The first contract was for $8.4 million (November, 1984 prices) and grew to $137.981 million (April 1991 prices). The Director of the Australian Defence Studies Centre wrote, "[The PPB program] is the centre&hyphen;piece of Australian defence cooperation (DC) in the South Pacific, representing around 35 percent of Australia's overall DC for the South Pacific (not including Papua New Guinea [PNG]).

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The island nations of the Pacific were the recipients of the Patrol Boats. One concern surfaced immediately. Operating costs for the boats were estimated at $200,000 a year, and infrastructure was required. This is a significant amount in the budget of an island ministate. In December 1987 the Western Samoan Public Accounts Committee claimed the boat would use the same amount of fuel as the entire police force in Western Samoa. Kiribati, Tuvalu and the Solomon Islands also were bothered by the operating costs. Canberra responded by removing the requirement that the recipient country would provide for the infrastructure. The Australian taxpayers were burdened additionally for an aid program which never consulted the recipient countries about their most pressing needs. Australia would provide maintenance, infrastructure, training and Royal Australian Navy (RAN) advisers with patrol boat and marine engineering or electronic expertise.</PARA>

Some of these demands were met by arming the PNG boats with 20 mm guns and 50 calibre machine guns. These boats were and are used in the Bougainville war which has spilled over into the Solomon Islands. In March 1989 the PNG government sent troops to Bougainville to put down a rebellion on Bougainville precipitated by the rebels closing the Panguna mine. In June 1989 the Australian government gave the PNG government four Iroquois helicopters. Shortly after Australia gave PNG the helicopters the Commonwealth Gazette, a journal containing official notices of the Australian Government, published a document. The document contradicted the conditions placed on the use of the helicopters. Supposedly the helicopters were not to be used in offensive roles but only for "supply, troop transport, surveillance and medical evacuation".</PARA>

This was a meeting of Defence Department bureaucrats where they discussed the controls on exports. The Department of Defence and customs people probably would follow any official policy. The talks mentioned the sale of rifles to Indonesia and the shipment of weaponry or equipment that could be used as weapons to PNG for possible use in Bougainville. In both cases department advice concerned human rights abuses. Ministerial decisions overrode concerns. The department bureaucracy follows all international conventions, control regimes and domestic legislation unless overridden by the minister. Political interference is the weak area in controls. There are no reports made on the degree of compliance. Without outside monitoring of the Minister of Defence any legislation will be ineffective.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One aim of the bill is to get some criteria for deciding whether the sale of arms to a country would be harmful. In the case that arms are genuinely for the defence of a country, would not likely be used against its own population and would not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="812"> significantly affect other needs, arms transfers seem legitimate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To determine that arms are only for defence is a subjective judgement. Submarines and long range missiles are offensive weapons. The noxious landmines are defensive weapons. However, the definitions can fuzz over in usage. Submarines used to sink the troopships in a fleet invading your country are defensive weapons. Landmines spread by air over the territory of another country become offensive weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Human rights data only apply to the past. One can assume that armies abusing human rights in the past will probably do so in the future. The most commonly used indicator of human rights in current practice are embargoes due to United Nations resolutions. However, Libya is condemned and Syria is not mainly due to the desire of the United States to get Syria's support in the Gulf War and get Syria to make peace with Israel. It is useful to appeal to United Nations decisions, but it must be noted that it only applies to those violators who are official pariahs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To scrutinise requests for arms transfers and defence cooperation agreements, applications for such arrangements must be made public. Decisions by the Department of Defence alone are not sufficient. Political reality indicates that the electoral effect of infusions of money into a district due to a military contract will often outweigh other considerations. They still may when such requests are made public, but at least the matter will be considered more thoroughly. Data to help consider the impact of such arrangements on the recipient nations must be supplied to aid in the consideration of the granting of arrangements for arms transfers. Data will be incomplete, but we can probably assume Australian weapons have already killed many times the thirty&hyphen;five people slaughtered in Port Arthur.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some countries should simply not be supplied with arms of any description. Any necessary peacekeeping should be done by United Nations forces. One essential element to surviving above a minimal level in the current world is access to health care. One sixth of the world's population, about 800 million people, have no access to health care. The poorest countries simply cannot spend more on health care. According to a report of "Save the Children" it costs at least $12 dollars (American) a year to provide basic health care. Sixteen African countries, Bangladesh, Nepal, India, Vietnam and Pakistan spend less than that. Yet, India, Vietnam and Pakistan have significant military establishments. India and Pakistan even have nuclear capability. Those countries should get no more arms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After a public hearing involving evaluation of economic effects and evidence of human rights 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> violations the request may be refused. Refusal of a request for arms transfers and defence cooperation will generally mean that the country seeking such a request will go elsewhere. That has been used as a reason for granting dubious requests. Granting dubious requests furthers oppression and the third world sinking deeper into debt. It is also possibly a criminal act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The tabling statement read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report I table today is an important one, domestically and internationally. It deals with two of the Protocols of the inhumane weapons convention: Protocol IV seeking to ban the use of blinding laser weapons and the amended Protocol II dealing with anti&hyphen;personnel landmines. The committee recommends early ratification of both Protocols.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Protocol IV to the convention seeks to prohibit the use of laser weapons, the purpose of which is to cause permanent blindness to unenhanced vision. These weapons are still being developed. During our inquiry, we were told that this is the first occasion since 1868 that there has been an attempt to ban a weapon before it has been used on the battlefield. The committee is pleased to be at the vanguard of such initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our attention was drawn also to some weaknesses in the Protocol. We have therefore recommended that Australia take every opportunity to ensure that these are corrected to make the document, and the prevention of the use of such weapons, more effective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amended Protocol II relates to the use on land of mines, booby&hyphen;traps and other devices. While landmines are a defensive weapon used by armies, demonstrably they can kill and maim innocent people, particularly children, long after a conflict has ended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian government has been prominent in the international move towards a total global ban on the manufacture, use and transfer of these inhumane weapons. The foreign minister most recently spoke at the disarmament conference in Geneva last month about the practical measures that the government supports to tackle the humanitarian disaster they cause. We have a proud record in undertaking humanitarian clearance operations via the Australian Defence Force (ADF), and in looking after the victims of these weapons via our international aid agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Stemming from a joint statement by the ministers for foreign affairs and defence last April, Australia has suspended the operational use of its landmines. That statement indicated that our stockpile of landmines would be retained `in case of a substantial deterioration in our strategic circumstances'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We received persuasive evidence that to seek a total global ban on these awful weapons, but at the same time to retain the stockpile in its entirety, could be hypocritical. The committee's view is that there is some substance in this argument. We have recommended therefore that Australia destroy its stockpile, except for a modest residual stock to ensure that the ADF retains a defensive capability 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="815"> to use landmines and including its important international humanitarian clearance operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two of our senatorial colleagues do not agree on this point and have submitted a dissent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We recommend also that Australia prepares a proposal for creation of an agreed international timetable for the destruction of the landmines of all nations when it attends the Ottawa conference later this year. Australia's international credibility will be enhanced as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other recommendations deal with:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Encouraging nations in our region to sign the inhumane weapons convention and all its Protocols,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The defence department assuming responsibility for all aspects of humanitarian mine clearing operations,</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Continued efforts by the government towards a total global ban on landmines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, in the limited time available, neither the honourable member for Barton nor I will be able to deal with all of the issues in this report, but we hope that it will be referred to the Main Committee where I am sure many honourable members inside and outside the Treaties Committee will want to express their views.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sure I speak for all committee members when I say that we hope that this report will assist towards the goal of a total global ban on landmines. We hope that our recommendations will make a further contribution to that end.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and I tried very hard to be at as many of the meetings as I could, as well as at the presentation at the school of engineers. I was at the majority of them. I did read the evidence and I think that we have come up with a report of which we can be proud. It recommends that we should agree to the banning of landmines, and that is a very good thing. It goes a bit further than the government has at the moment, but not very much further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is to the credit of those who have brought landmines and the problems associated with landmines to the notice of the public over the last several years&mdash;many years, in fact&mdash;that the committee has, with the exception of two members, agreed that we should get rid of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stockpile of landmines. Most of the members of the government on the committee and all of the members of all non&hyphen;government parties on the committee agreed that we should get rid of the stockpile of landmines. That was the one area where there was any disagreement, and only two members of the committee, as I said, disagreed with that&mdash;and even they thought we should get rid of the stockpile after everybody else had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rest of us believed that we should get rid of the stockpile as soon as possible, keeping only as many landmines as are necessary for training purposes and to enable Australia as a nation to maintain the very good record that we already have on the destruction and elimination of landmines throughout the world. Landmines are, as you will recognise if you read this report&mdash;I recommend it to all senators&mdash;one of the great blights on the face of the world today. They are only getting worse. We have very few in this country anyway, and our defence forces have in the past only used landmines when they were an accepted weapon of war. They are now becoming not an accepted weapon of war, I am very thankful to say. When they were, our defence forces used them responsibly as far as that could be done. They marked them and they picked them up when they had finished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While our Defence Force is one of the very few in the world that actually does that&mdash;there are not that many&mdash;there are many more people who use these destructive, abhorrent weapons and then leave them in the ground after any fighting is finished. As we all know, the real problem with landmines is that they do not know when the war is over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The vast majority of people who are killed or injured by landmines are civilians&mdash;they are not military people at all. They are civilians, mostly children or women in the fields. This situation will be maintained for a very long time to come; it costs an absolute fortune to get rid of landmines. They should be banned. They should be absolutely gone from the face of the earth. It will take many years for that to happen. It will take the destruction of many more children's limbs, and many more civilians and probably a few military 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="816"> people as well, before these things are gone&mdash;as gone they should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to be associated with a report that recommends that Australia should lead the world in getting rid of landmines and that says we agree with the way the government has gone on this and that it should go a bit further. I think we should go a lot further, but I am very pleased to say that the rest of the committee, apart from those two members, have agreed that we should go that bit further right now.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Australia destroy its stockpile of anti&hyphen;personnel landmines, except for a small number to be retained for training purposes to ensure that the Australian Defence Force retains its skills, and</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that is what is very important. I hope the government will pursue that issue and take a lead. I found it rather interesting and disappointing that Senator Abetz and, in particular, Senator Ellison would take the position that they ultimately took. From memory, I do not think that Senator Ellison participated in the committee debate when we were formulating these recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contrast, in the dissenting report, a replacement recommendation for that of the majority committee&mdash;which included all of the government members with the exception of Senator Abetz and Senator Ellison&mdash;is suggested. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That Australia should declare its willingness to destroy its land mines except for training stock. It should only destroy the rest of its land mines once a substantial number of significant nations in our region have committed themselves to this course, according to an agreed international timetable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Given the position that the coalition took when we were in government and grappling with this issue and the statements of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) on the issue, that recommendation is a somewhat significant backward step. I hope it will be ignored by the government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was pointed out, the evidence that was given to the committee&mdash;although I was not present&mdash;was that we could actually destroy the significant stocks that we have, with the exception of certain numbers for training purposes and for maintaining expertise in the field of demining. I find it very disappointing that two of the government members on this committee have chosen to take the course of action that they have, given that otherwise we would have had a unanimous report.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on this very important report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Restrictions on the use of blinding laser weapons and land mines</EMPHASIS> . It is very important because, as Senator Bourne has mentioned, it is something which is of vast concern around the world. It is of vast concern because the civilian population is always the one which takes the brunt of this weapon. It is debilitating. It stops people from being able to produce the food that they need to survive. It is intimidatory. More importantly, it causes ghastly, horrendous deaths and debilitating injuries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no real rationale for continuing to allow Australia to be involved in even thinking of using this horrific antipersonnel weapon. Therefore, if we cannot see any reason why we would use it in this country or anywhere else, we should be leading the world in pushing towards its total abolition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not too long ago that then Senator Gareth Evans, in response to questions from me in this chamber, said that such a proposal was hopelessly utopian. I am very glad to see that 16 members of this committee are also hopelessly utopian; I believe they are realistic. It was suggested at that time by the former Labor government that the halfway step was a more achievable action; that is, to ban landmines that were detectable or self&hyphen;destructive. That is not more achievable. It is more achievable to go for a total ban.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, if there were a proper, funded challenge in the World Court, we would probably find that these weapons are not and never were legal under the international law, because of the fact that they are designed primarily to stop civilians from being able to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="817"> continue their lives, not just for the present but way into the future, by stopping people from being able to make their food. For years and years to come, even after hostilities have ceased, they continue to pay the price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to see that there are steps being taken in relation to this matter. I am very keen to see what the response is from the government, and from Defence in particular, to this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. I do urge that the response be positive. I would assure the government that this is one issue where there is strong community support for Australia to take the `hopelessly utopian' stand, the only just and right stand in relation to the total elimination of antipersonnel landmines.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I have pleasure in presenting this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on a seminar on Papua New Guinea held in November last year in Canberra. The seminar provided an opportunity for the committee to review developments in Papua New Guinea and the bilateral relationship with Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is five years since the committee tabled a very comprehensive report on Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea and in that time much as changed. As much as possible, people and organisations involved in the original inquiry were asked to attend and, all up, some 100 people with an interest in Papua New Guinea participated. I would like to thank, in particular, the Papua New Guinea High Commissioner, Brigadier General Ken 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> neth Nogar and Vice Admiral David Leach, President of the Australia&hyphen;Papua New Guinea Friendship Association for their support for the seminar and for the contribution they made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seminar examined political, economic, security and social issues, and this is reflected in the final report and its 14 recommendations. The seminar also devoted considerable time to the Bougainville situation, and, of course, the dreadful assassination of Theodore Miriung, Premier of the Bougainville transitional government, was still fresh in people's minds. The tragedy on Bougainville continues, and a number of recommendations regarding it are made in this report. Much has been said in the parliament about Bougainville and the continuing difficulties there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seminar report contains a time line showing the development of a crisis and it is instructive for those interested in the subject. The hope that existed in 1994 was, unfortunately, short lived and the violence has continued at an alarming rate with deaths not only amongst the BRA and the PNG defence force but increasingly among the population. In section 4 of the report, the committee notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any examination of the ebb and flow of the conflict on Bougainville would suggest that the PNG Government should return to the strategies that were developed under Sir Julius Chan in 1994-95. This was not without its frustrations or its setbacks but it was the most peaceful period of the conflict so far and the time when most of the BRA support was whittled away.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It was apparent to all who attended the seminar that neither side in the conflict will be able to achieve a military solution. There needs to be a cease-fire and peace talks if any progress is to be made. The committee has recommended that international observers, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross or the International Commission of Jurists, be stationed on Bougainville to give greater protection to the population and encourage greater discipline in the defence forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Over the weekend we learned of the quite extraordinary and alarming situation of the hiring of between 50 to 150 mercenaries to assassinate people in Bougainville. This is not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="818"> the time to debate this matter here, but it would be remiss of me&mdash;on behalf of the committee&mdash;not to draw attention to it in public. This is entirely alien to the practices of this part of the world, particularly for New Guinea. Whatever problems Papua New Guinea has at the present time, it is basically and fundamentally a very democratic society. It might be a society based on tribalism and regional loyalties&mdash;and that has been one of the problems it has faced in forging a new nation state&mdash;but, basically, it is a very democratic society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While there has been conflict between the different groups, the introduction of mercenaries in the form of something akin to the Executive Outcomes group and Sandline International is something that everyone in Australia would find quite extraordinary and quite alarming. Australia, of course, recognises that Papua New Guinea is a sovereign state and its affairs are its own matter, but we cannot stand idly by and see the employment of assassination groups to solve what are essentially political problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a very great respect for Sir Julius Chan whom I have known personally for probably 18 years. I am astonished that he could be party to an agreement like this. But he ought to be advised of the fact that people like Executive Outcomes or any of the mercenary armies have never achieved any satisfactory outcomes where they have been employed in Africa. Tragically, I have been in parts of Africa and seen the dreadful human rights abuses and the rest of it that mercenary armies do cause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The details of what is going on in New Guinea at the present time are obscure to some degree, but it does seem to be beyond dispute that between $35 million and $50 million has been spent in recruiting these mercenaries. This is not something that happened overnight; they just did not get off a plane. The planning for that and the recruitment of them&mdash;signing them up to contracts&mdash;would have taken at least two months and probably quite a bit longer. It is clearly a premeditated move by the Papua New Guinea administration. A point not lost on Australia is that, given the desperate financial position 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of New Guinea, the $35 million to $50 million obviously involves quite a large proportion of Australian aid money, which is a position that all of us would find quite intolerable. I do not wish to debate this much further, because it is something that we will certainly be returning to in the Senate to debate at length and in detail in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to conclude by thanking all those involved in the seminar for their contributions: the member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who chaired the seminar so well; the members of the committee who were able to attend; government officials; academics; representatives of NGOs; business and community groups; and the many individuals in Australia who have an abiding interest in Papua New Guinea and its future welfare. I would also like to thank the secretariat of the committee, particularly Margaret Swieringa, Jan Fuhrman and Cliff Lawson, who arranged a very successful event and drafted the report. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find myself in the unique situation of agreeing with almost everything that Senator MacGibbon has said, which does not happen very often. But I think that what he said was very good and that people should take note of it. He is exactly right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I attended the seminar and I was also a member of the delegation that Australia sent to Bougainville in 1994 to see what Australians could do to try to help solve the situation there. The one thing that we found everybody agreed on, after we had been to the island and travelled around the island as much as we could, was that there is no military solution to this problem; there has to be a negotiated solution where everybody has to sit down and talk about it; and they have to come to some agreement which is a non-military agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have to agree absolutely with what Senator MacGibbon has said about mercenary armies. They just do not work. It does not solve anything. The government of Papua New Guinea&mdash;if this is truly the case&mdash;will have spent a great deal of money, an enormous amount of money. They will have created more problems for themselves through 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="819"> human rights abuses which will inevitably occur when mercenary armies are involved and through the international outcry because this has happened. There will be murders; there will be deaths&mdash;not just of the people that the PNG government must want to see got rid of if they are employing a mercenary army, but also of many other people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems almost inevitable that there has been a move such as this. The international condemnation that must follow this and must follow the results of this will be absolutely massive. It is in nobody's best interests, least of all those of the Papua New Guinea government. I was shocked when I heard it myself. I have known Sir Julius Chan only since 1994 when we were over there and I met him and spoke with him quite a bit. I was really quite shocked when I heard the rumours that this has happened. I have read today the press reports on what has happened. What Senator MacGibbon has said is pretty well what I have read as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I find this extraordinary. I just do not believe that any good can possibly come of it in any way whatsoever. The seminar came up with some very good conclusions and recommendations. I think I can say that the general feeling on Bougainville from the seminar was that no military solution is possible and that we have to look at ways that we can assist in finding a negotiated solution. That is still the case, and that will remain the case well and truly until a solution to the problem in Bougainville is found.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the mercenaries are called Executive Solutions, it is unfortunately very similar to the Holocaust being called the final solution. It is about killing. It is about people who are paid to kill&mdash;and they are very good at it. This is certainly not an issue that has been thought of only in the last few months. I asked questions on notice and questions without notice of then Senator Gareth Evans, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, back in 1994. There were already reports then that two Australians were involved in mercenary forces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked questions last year as well in relation to mercenaries. In 1989 there was an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amendment to the Crimes Act which meant that it was no longer an offence under the Australian Crimes Act for Australian ex-military personnel to be involved with or recruited as mercenaries or for companies like Executive Solutions or any others to come to Australia and recruit Australians if necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not know who this band of mercenaries are. What we do know is that the Australian government, of whichever type, has never been able to confirm or deny whether Australians are involved amongst the mercenaries, perhaps because of their knowledge of the Australian equipment used by the Papua New Guinean defence forces or captured equipment used by rebels, the BRA or so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was in fact in 1994 that Sir Julius Chan made a statement about routing out the rebels in Papua New Guinea and elsewhere. I made statements about that. We kind of wondered whether or not there would mercenaries in other countries&mdash;countries seeking out members of the BRA, BIG or supporters of those people in Bougainville who were asking for a just solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with those people who say, again and again, that there cannot be a military solution. I have spoken to the Senate before about my attending a conference of women last year, which was very important for me, who came from both sides of the blockade. They had not seen each other or spoken to each other for years. If there was a message that came out, it was that there will be no solution in Bougainville until there is justice&mdash;that is, justice in relation to land, to the environment and to the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Up to 10,000 lives&mdash;through various means such as starvation, lack of medical resources and deaths&mdash;through all sides in the conflict, is too big a price to pay if Australia's support is largely about the commercial support of a mining operation by CRA. That is not worth 10,000 lives. Nothing could be worth 10,000 lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parties do speak of land justice. It is true that the majority of people in Bougainville want peace, but they also want self-determination. I am not just talking here about radical voices within Bougainville. The late Theodore Miriung came to Australia to give 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="820"> that message to Australia. He spoke at a lecture at the Australian National University and said that peace is certainly desired, but self-determination is on and never has been off the agenda in Bougainville. There are two messages there: there will be no final peace without justice, and self-determination is on and never has been off the agenda in Bougainville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever the Australian government decides to do now, I urge that that be part of our presentation whenever we speak to the Papua New Guinean government. Australia is the largest donor of aid to Papua New Guinea. The concept that it is not possible for Australia to review the aid that we send on the basis of whether or not it is going to where it is specified to go is bizarre. It is well overdue that that review was made. If there are areas within Australia's aid which are going in the wrong direction&mdash;that are going in areas that have not been specified in the conditions by which that aid is given&mdash;then Australia must take action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of Australia's aid is not going to poverty alleviation. One can only wonder whether the latest $4 million does actually go for emergency relief. In the light of, perhaps, $30 or $60 million being spent in setting up paid guns to murder people for money, then I think it is certainly time for the Australian government to make a strong stand&mdash;not just to talk strongly but to say, `Look, we're not funding this any more. We are not putting taxpayers' money into continuing murdering people on Bougainville.'</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report I have just presented records the outcomes of the Fifth Annual Meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum, held in Vancouver, Canada in the period 7-10 January 1997. The Speaker of the House of Representatives led the Australian delegation, which included, as well as myself, the Honourable members for Moore, Throsby and Wills. In my view, the delegation made a strong contribution to debate during the meeting and to the activities of the Executive Committee and the Drafting Committee. As with earlier meetings of the APPF, the Australian delegation strongly supported the APPF process, providing four discussion papers and draft resolutions in advance of the meeting, and participating in a wide range of plenary debates during the meeting itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fifth Annual Meeting of the APPF consolidated the significant advances made at the Fourth Annual meeting in Thailand, in January 1996. The APPF is now an increasingly important regional association, with a strong corporate entity and an established set of sound procedures and practices. The growing importance of the APPF, and its loose association with the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) grouping of economies, indicates a continuing role of some significance for the APPF. This is reflected in the breadth and depth of the regional vision statement adopted by the fifth Annual Meeting of the Vancouver Declaration, which is discussed in the report, and in the wide variety of subjects covered by the 18 resolutions adopted by the meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among these were resolutions dealing with:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Bob Halverson was unavoidably delayed in attending the forum because of aircraft difficulties and so I represented him on the opening day at the meeting of the APPF Executive Committee. I also represented the Commonwealth on the Drafting Committee which worded resolutions and the final communique.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangements made by the Parliament of Canada for the Fifth annual Meeting were excellent, and contributed significantly to the success of the meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The delegation would wish to express its appreciation for the strong support provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of the Parliamentary Library, in the form of detailed written briefings on all agenda items and the preparation of discussion papers and draft resolutions before departure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia, a foundation member of the APPF Executive Committee, remains a member of that committee until the next annual meeting of the APPF, scheduled to be held in Pusan, the Republic of Korea in January 1998. This meeting will be preceded by a meeting of the Executive Committee in Seoul in September of this year, at which, among other issues, the question of the membership and means of election of the Executive committee will be discussed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The delegation's experience in Vancouver confirmed its view that the APPF is an important regional forum, linking legislators from 24 countries of the region who represent some 44% of the world's population.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CRIMES AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a portfolio bill which contains a number of minor policy and technical amendments to portfolio legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will deal with the proposed amendments in the order in which they appear in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is amendments to correct anomalies in relation to the cancellation of employer funded superannuation benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed to amend Part VA of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989, to deal with the situation where the manner of sentencing for multiple offences produces a result which fails to trigger the cancelling of employer-funded superannuation provisions where policy indicates that they should be triggered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both Acts provide for cancellation of employer funded superannuation benefits where a person is convicted of a corruption offence and sentenced to more than 12 months imprisonment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a person has committed multiple offences, the court may impose a sentence in such a way that the sentences are cumulative, partly cumulative or concurrent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, a person could be convicted of two counts of fraud and be sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for each count, with three months of the sentence on the second count to be cumulative to the sentence on the first count.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That means the head sentence is 15 months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, a court might impose a single sentence which exceeds twelve months in relation to multiple offences, instead of imposing a sentence for each offence, any of which would not exceed twelve months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the example I just mentioned, the court may order a single sentence of 15 months for both offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In both those examples, the individual terms of imprisonment do not exceed twelve months, and therefore a superannuation order may not be made against the person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments make a technical amendment to align Part VA of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989 with current sentencing practice.  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A superannuation order may be made if the single sentence in respect of multiple corruption offences or the aggregate of sentences in respect of multiple corruption offences, exceeds twelve months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989 are proposed to exclude sentences that are an alternative to full time incarceration, from the scope of sentences that cancel employer funded superannuation benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of those amendments is that a superannuation order may not be made against a person who is convicted of a corruption offence and receives a sentence under subsection 20AB of the Crimes Act (for example, periodic detention), even if the sentence is for a period longer than 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Crimes Act 1914 is to be amended to increase the value of a penalty unit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1992 it was decided that all pecuniary penalty provisions in Commonwealth legislation were to be expressed in penalty units to enable penalties to be adjusted from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The penalty unit approach allows the real level of fines to be maintained on a uniform basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation was designed in such terms that, by amendment of section 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914, the value of the penalty units applicable to an offence under any Commonwealth act or regulation could be varied to reflect current money value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the enactment of the provision, inflation has diminished the value of penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to figures provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the change in the Consumer Price Index numbers between June 1992 and September 1995 is calculated at approximately 9.6 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The penalty unit will be increased from $100 to $110.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Customs Act 1901 is to be amended to permit cost recovery in relation to storage and maintenance of confiscated narcotic-related goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment is aimed at enabling the Commonwealth to recover out of pocket expenses it incurs in relation to the transportation and storage of narcotic-related goods that are condemned and placed in commercial storage facilities, prior to the goods being transferred to the Official Trustee for disposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Narcotic-related goods are, generally speaking, vehicles or vessels used in drug trafficking.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will allow the Commonwealth to recover its costs just as the Official Trustee recovers similar costs under the Customs Act. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="823">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment does not extend to full cost recovery for the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will not be entitled to recover its expenses such as the salary of staff, nor is it entitled to recover expenses that are an ordinary incident of its operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ordinary everyday running costs such as office expenses, telephone or facsimile charges are not recoverable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather, it is the extraordinary costs such as the costs of transportation of narcotic-related goods to a place of storage and the actual storage charges that will be recoverable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Extradition Act 1988 is to be amended in two minor ways to correct deficiencies in present provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first amendment will make it clear that if a person makes an application for bail on the merits and fails, the person is not able to make a further application unless there is evidence of a change in circumstances that might justify bail being granted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, where a magistrate remands a person in custody after the person has made an application for bail, the person is not entitled to apply to any other magistrate for release on bail during that remand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That would be unfair if the person's circumstances change such that bail would be justified, but the original magistrate is no longer available, for example, if the original magistrate has resigned or retired.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will overcome this deficiency while still achieving the purpose of restricting `magistrate-shopping'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second amendment to the Extradition act deals with the appropriate procedure following the arrest of persons who are believed to have escaped from custody.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will make it clear that the appropriate action following arrest is to take the person before a magistrate for testing of the arresting police officer's belief that the person has escaped from custody.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The magistrate will be required to be satisfied that the person has escaped from custody authorised by the act before issuing a warrant authorising return to custody.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, a person who has been arrested by a police officer without warrant, when the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person has escaped from custody, can simply be returned to custody.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several minor and technical amendments are made to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first relates to applications for variation of restraining orders, and extensions of time. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Proceeds of Crime Act allows a court to restrain property of defendants charged with serious offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The property that remains restrained six months after conviction is forfeited automatically to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person may apply to the court to have the restraining order varied to release any or all of the property from the restraining order, but that application must be listed, heard and decided before the end of six months after conviction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because many defendants await the outcome of the trial before applying for a variation of restraining orders, applications need to be heard and determined within six months and that often places considerable pressure on court lists.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments are designed to alleviate that pressure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where an application for a variation of a restraining order is made within the statutory six month period, the amendments will stay the forfeiture of restrained property until that application has been judicially determined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another amendment to the Proceeds of Crime Act relates to creating a defence of reasonable corporate precaution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Proceeds of Crime Act a body corporate is vicariously liable for the criminal conduct of its directors, servants or agents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other Commonwealth legislation establishes liability similarly, but at the same time, provides a defence of reasonable corporate precaution, for example, subsection 65(2) of the Ozone Protection Act 1989, a provision which is used as a model for this proposed amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment prevents the criminal conduct of directors, servants or agents from being imputed to a body corporate where the body corporate can demonstrate that it took reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence to avoid the conduct of its directors servants and agents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final act amended by Schedule 1 of the bill is the Witness Protection Act 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The integrity of the National Witness Protection Program established under the Witness Protection Act is of paramount consideration, not only for the witnesses on the Program but the Australian Federal Police members who carry out the protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, section 22 of the Witness Protection Act creates various offences relating to unauthorised disclosure about the Program or witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsection 22(2) of the Witness Protection Act makes it an offence for a person who is or who has been a Commonwealth participant on the Program or a person who has been assessed for placement 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="824"> to make certain disclosures, unless authorised to do so by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. The Ombudsman may investigate complaints about the Program either on the complaint of a person or on her own initiative under the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment to subsection 22(2) will enable a Commonwealth participant, a former participant or a person who has undergone assessment to make disclosures, without obtaining the consent of the Commissioner, when making a complaint to the Ombudsman under either the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 or the Ombudsman Act 1976.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 2 of the bill removes the requirement in several Commonwealth Acts to obtain consent to prosecute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the repeal of certain provisions requiring the consent of a Minister before a prosecution can be instituted against a person suspected of a Commonwealth offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those provisions were originally enacted for the purpose of deterring private prosecutions brought in inappropriate circumstances, particularly for offences which related to national security or international treaty obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, since establishing the office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions the retention of those provisions is difficult to justify.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is particularly so now that the Director of Public Prosecutions has the power to take over and discontinue a private prosecution brought in relation to a Commonwealth offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once the consent provisions which appear in the bill are repealed the Director will have the task of instituting proceedings for the relevant offences.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996, which is now before the chamber, contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. I will briefly outline the changes of substance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Customs Tariff Act 1995 re&hyphen;enacted legislation contained in the Customs Tariff Act 1987 and incorporates about 350 tariff classification amend

The overall aim of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 was to maintain levels of tariff assistance which would have been in existence on the first of July 1996 in the previous act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule one of this bill contains amendments which were made to ensure the correctness of detail in the new Customs Tariff Act before it became operative on the first of July 1996. Most of the changes are of an editorial nature correcting format and spelling anomalies. The more substantive changes are&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The rates of duty for beer, spirits, tobacco products and certain petroleum products are the subject of half&hyphen;yearly adjustments in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The rates of duty for these goods increased on the first of February 1996. Those increased rates of duty are being included in the new legislation. This is necessary to establish the correct commencement duty levels for future CPI duty adjustments;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are minor drafting changes to vehicle alarm systems and passenger motor vehicle components  of heading eighty four nineteen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule two of this bill is operative from the fifteenth of July 1996. Customs tariff amendment act (no. 1) 1996&mdash;act 32 of 1996&mdash;contained consequential changes as a result of amendments to the tariff concession system. Item 19 in part ii of schedule 4 allows the concessional entry of goods which have been sent overseas for repair that cannot be carried out in Australia. The amendments contained in Act 32 would have meant that importers would have paid duty on the value of the exported articles in addition to that on the repair cost. Administrative procedures were implemented to ensure that customs duty was only collected on the repair cost of the re&hyphen;imported goods. This amendment gives legal effect to the administrative action taken on the fifteenth of July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule three of this bill is operative from the first of September 1996. On the twentieth of August 1996, my colleague the minister for transport and regional development, John Sharp, announced a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="825"> reduction of 0.75 cents per litre on the duty on aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The duty reductions stem from the over&hyphen;recovery during 1995&hyphen;96 of the aviation industry's contribution to the operating costs of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the bill provides for appropriations and the issue of securities to effect Australia's membership of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators will be aware that MIGA is one of the World Bank institutions. MIGA's purpose is to foster foreign investment in developing countries by providing:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">insurance against the risks of currency transfer, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">advisory services to developing member countries on means of encouraging additional foreign investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to join MIGA and to take up the remaining shares allocated to Australia in recent capital increases of the International Finance Corporation and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development signal the government's strong interest in the World Bank and its desire to enhance Australia's relations with the Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Membership of the World Bank institutions benefits Australia in a number of ways.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's experience with PNG has clearly shown the benefits of World Bank involvement. The World Bank Group is able to attach policy conditions to its aid more effectively than can bilateral donors. It has the capacity to establish an effective policy dialogue and assist in the coordination of development assistance from multiple sources and, therefore, to maximise the development effectiveness of aid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Membership of MIGA and other institutions of the World Bank also provides Australian firms with procurement opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian business has increasingly been interested in Australia becoming a member of MIGA. Some businesses believe they have been disadvantaged in competing for projects supported by MIGA guarantees because Australia has not been a member. In its report to the previous government, on `Australia, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund', the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade (JSCFADT) concluded that the benefits of joining MIGA outweighed the costs and recommended that Australia join. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="827">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Successive Australian governments have supported Australian exporters with their export credit risks through the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC). MIGA's political risk insurance and other technical and advisory services will complement EFIC's political risk insurance facilities. Membership could allow EFIC to reduce its own exposure to high risk countries and where its exposure in a particular country is already at its limit. EFIC will also be able to use MIGA as a reinsurer and co&hyphen;insurer. MIGA will also insure Australian investors in multinational joint ventures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia will also benefit from MIGA's services in identifying investment opportunities marketed by developing member countries of MIGA. MIGA has advised that it has already received several preliminary applications for MIGA coverage for prospective Australian investments in developing countries. Once Australia is a member, MIGA will be able to process such applications. Membership will provide the additional support necessary to enhance Australian companies' growing trade and investment linkages with developing countries, particularly in the Asian region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from the commercial benefits to Australian business, Australia's membership of MIGA will acknowledge the role that MIGA plays in promoting economic development through facilitating private sector investment in developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since its establishment, MIGA has facilitated more than $US8.5 billion in foreign private investment. Of this, 26 per cent related to host countries in the Asia region, including Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines and Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The budget cost of Australia's membership to MIGA will be small.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To effect its membership, Australia will subscribe to the 1,713 shares allocated to it. The cost of each share is $US10,820. The total cost is $US18.5 million ($A24.5 million). Of this amount, 10 per cent (equivalent to $A2.45 million) will be paid in cash in a one&hyphen;off payment, with a further 10 per cent covered by a promissory note. The remainder of the cost, $A19.6 million, would be on&hyphen;call.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill indicates in its terms just how important this legislation is for Australia. Part 3 of the bill, entitled `Purposes of the reserve', illustrates the point I am making. It states that the purposes of the reserve are: the national vegetation initiative, the Murray&hyphen;Darling 2001 project, the national land and water resources audit, and so on. It goes on in clause 10 to deal with the primary objective of the national vegetation initiative and in clause 11 to deal with the primary objective of the Murray&hyphen;Darling 2001 project. Another area it deals with is the coast and clean seas initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear from the terms of this bill that the renovation of Australia is urgent and necessary. It is for that reason that concern ought to be expressed about the funding of the reserve. I do not want to go into the Telstra debate again, because that has been fought and lost. The point I want to make is that the funding for the renewal of Australia's physical resources should be one of the first appropriations made out of consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, if you look at part 4, entitled `Crediting of amounts to the reserve', and clause 22 in particular, you find that you are left with the impression that this provision is conditional upon something that might or might not have happened at one stage. That condition has been fulfilled. A third of Telstra is to be sold and the money from that sale will come into the reserve. In funding the environment in that way the message that goes out to Australian citizens is that the problem of the condition of Australia is not quite as enormous as in fact it is and that the need to do something about the environment is not quite as great as we think.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="828">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 3 sets out a simplified outline of the act. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Act establishes a Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Reserve&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">if that is a good thing. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major source of funds for the Reserve will be $1 billion from the partial privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a concern because it gives people the perception, as I said, that this fund is not as important as it is. It gives a basis for an attitude to be established amongst the people of Australia, for a perception to grow and for presuppositions to be developed which I think are very bad if we are going to do as much as we can do for Australia and for its environment. This act could be improved by simply saying, `Yes, we are getting money out of Telstra but whether the money comes from Telstra or not it will be made available in greater quantities than $1 billion,' and by saying, `This is one of the great priorities in Australia at the moment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt those who follow me will say that the previous government did not do as much as it should have. Whether or not that is correct seems to me to be irrelevant to the present debate because the present debate is about what we are going to do in the future. It is about what this government, and indeed this parliament, intends to do in the future. And that is where it ought to lie. The legislation can be improved considerably by taking away the link with Telstra&mdash;even now and even though money might come from Telstra. By taking away that link from the black&hyphen;letter law in the bill it would become apparent to all that this is one of the primary tasks of the country&mdash;and of the community, acting through its parliament&mdash;and that it is not something that is subsidiary or something that depends on an event which at one point may or may not have taken place.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think a nasty sleight of hand has taken place because, while there has been much fanfare about the extra $1 billion, there has not been any fanfare about&mdash;and I do not wonder why&mdash;cuts of something like $76 million this year to the Landcare and the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin initiatives. Now, this is a little bit of a worry because when you actually sift through the figures and get to the point of everything you will find that, overall, the Natural Heritage Trust only provides $84.3 million per year over and above what was promised by Labor&mdash;not the $1 billion that was in the headlines that people all thought was going to be the additional expenditure on the environment. No, this year it is $84.3 million, bearing in mind that we have cut out $76 million for Landcare and for the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether people&mdash;those who come from some of the other states; maybe the west&mdash;give a great deal of thought to the importance of work on the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin initiative, but that is the largest basin in Australia in terms of water catchment and drainage. It has some major problems across the whole of it. It affects some four states and one territory&mdash;I should probably say two territories because part of it goes very close to the Northern Territory as well&mdash;plus the Commonwealth government. It was only after the election of a Labor government in Queensland that we got Queensland to come on board and become a full member of the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin Commission. In the days of Sir Joh Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen they were taking the attitude that the water that landed in Queensland was their water and they would do what they jolly well liked with it.

I hope the current National Party government is not going to revisit a number of those sorts of proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposal should not ever have been linked to the sale of Telstra. Many speakers in the Telstra debate outlined the reasons for that and I do not think I need to go into them here today. Senator Cooney has already very carefully and clearly outlined why this should not have been happening. I repeat: I think it is a very poor show that we have not got out to the general public that there is not an extra $1 billion for the environment out of this heritage trust, because cuts have been made to Environment Australia and to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said earlier that the heritage trust will this year only provide an additional $84.3 million over and above what we had promised. But when you take out the money for Tasmania, the rest of Australia will get $42 million per year. This is a bit interesting. I come from New South Wales&mdash;the most populous state in the country and while not in the large category, it is certainly a lot larger than Tasmania&mdash;and I want to know why just about half of this additional funding is going to Tasmania. I have not got anything against Tasmanians, nor the land. I know that they have a significant number of very important environmental areas that need looking after, that need caring for, and so they should get some money. But I have concerns, when I am given these sorts of facts and figures, as to why we are seeing just about half of the additional funding hived off to one state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then of course there was the sale of Telstra and the additional infrastructure money that was going to be spent as a result of the sale of Telstra. Guess where the majority of that went. Tasmania. Poor old New South Wales missed out again. Something like $15 or less a head extra we got and they were getting hundreds and hundreds of dollars a head. This is just not fair. This is not a government that

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is pretty terrible what happens. One of my other concerns in relation to this bill is that it is not clear about the guidelines or the rationale for setting up a trust. I have concerns that this has the potential to become a slush fund. I do not think the accountability mechanisms in this bill are adequate and that was certainly highlighted in the Senate committee's hearings. The bill does not include measures to account for improvements as a result of expenditure programs against base level data and objectives; to ensure that no project receives funding where the existing regulations will work against achievements of the trust's goals; and to ensure needs based funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we have not got adequate and appropriate accountability, how in heavens name are we going to ensure that it does not become a slush fund?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also going to be a board to administer the trust fund. That board will comprise the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, and the role of the board will be to provide a forum for consultation between the two 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="830"> ministers. We have just seen in the last week the fun and games that this government has appointing people to boards and to chairs, and ministers' recommendations being rolled quite easily, it appears.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen two positions that have now been extended for a further 12 months. The government knew before it even came to office when the terms of these people expired; it has been in government 12 months next week, and it has had to extend these positions because it cannot make decisions. One has to wonder how it will be able to come up with this board given the speed with which it has been able to reappoint some people and the problems the ministers seem to keep having when they go to cabinet to get their particular appointees nominated into positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We notice that it has been a pretty glossy marketing campaign. Very glossy documents have appeared in our offices.

I presume someone at estimates is going to be able to ask that question, because it is not normal for us&mdash;for any government or any member of parliament&mdash;to receive such huge numbers of guidelines and applications for programs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You want to involve us. Let us just look at this involvement and what it might take. Normally, the procedure for making an application and using guidelines for the application for funding is controlled fairly well through the departmental officers, kept at arm's length from members of parliament and particularly from ministers. The information is available to be provided to people, and members certainly can seek that. But I have never known or experienced in the seven and a bit years that I have been in this game&mdash;nearly eight years now&mdash;such a large number of application forms to arrive on my desk for me to distribute. This sends to me messages about just how at arm's length this is going to be from the political process. I get a great deal of concern when I see and re 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ceive this number of applications, and then I hear a parliamentary secretary saying that it is so we can be involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want the money from this program to be administered in such a fashion that those programs in greatest need, those programs with most merit, are the ones in receipt of the money. I do not want a program where somebody&mdash;it is not likely to be somebody from this side of the chamber, I would wager&mdash;from that side and from cockies corner, I suppose, is able to really agitate and put a lot of pressure on and use this like a slush fund. This is where accountability must be totally transparent and where there needs to be arm's&hyphen;length dealing with this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Departmental officers&mdash;good, unbiased and caring public servants&mdash;would be able to evaluate and assess these applications against strict criteria. By using well researched data, they would know what the needs are and would be able to address those needs. We cannot expect members of parliament to be able to follow all the way through 20 or 30 applications. The government would be asking for trouble if it followed this course. I warn them to be very careful about this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would also to like to draw their attention to an article that appeared in the October 1996 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Science Technology</EMPHASIS>, volume 16, No. 10&mdash;a monthly round&hyphen;up of science and technology in Australia. Its headline is, `Natural heritage trust fraud: admits senior coalition adviser'. The first paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Howard Government's proposed Natural Heritage Trust is a "blatant and cynical political fraud", a senior government adviser has admitted to Scitech.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These sorts of things indicate that the government obviously feel pretty pleased about what they have done. They think they will able have a nice little fund. These sorts of articles and comments make me use the word `slush' fund; they make me very concerned about what will happen. When senior ministerial advisers brag to magazines that this is pretty good, then one has to wonder what the situation is. The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The plan had been essentially devised&mdash;as a "purely political exercise"&mdash;by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Andrew Robb, and had 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="831"> then been "imposed" on the former shadow Minister for the Environment, Senator Rod Kemp, and, subsequently, on the current Minister for the Environment, Senator Robert Hill, he claimed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is the sort of stuff that one should be very much aware of. It also goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anybody who looks at the figures can quickly see that the Natural Heritage Trust is a blatant and cynical political fraud. There is simply no way the interest from the $1 billion supposedly to be diverted from the Telstra sale could possibly pay to rectify the enormous environmental problems confronting Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was all a quote, not my words. They are the words of a senior government ministerial adviser. I do not think one can rest one's argument on things that are more soundly based than that&mdash;the braggings of what government ministers' staffers are saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a pity that, as a result of the demolition of Telstra, we are seeing $1 billion being used to divert attention and to disguise the fact that in a number of areas there have actually been significant cuts to the Landcare program and Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin initiatives. It was the Labor Party that instigated such programs as Landcare; it even pronounced the 1990s as a decade of landcare. It was Labor that set up important labour market programs with environmental benefits such as LEAP. It is the Liberal Party and the National Party that have slashed $20 million from the expansion of Landcare and abolished LEAP. The rural communities of New South Wales certainly do not think these are the actions of a government serious about the environment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take a few minutes of the Senate's time today to speak briefly to this important piece of legislation, namely, the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill 1996. Once upon time we could boast in the Senate that we had much better debates than in the House of Representatives. But I would have to say, having listened today to all the speakers from the Greens, the Democrats and the Labor Party&mdash;with the exception of Senator Cooney, who made a thoughtful contribution in his habitual way&mdash;that we can no longer claim that reputation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not debating the sale of Telstra. I know that Senator West is always a long way 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> behind the action&mdash;probably 10 or 15 years&mdash;but, really, that bill has been passed. We are talking about the environment. I think the debate today has demonstrated clearly the way the environmental debate has moved on in Australia to what is now an informed and sophisticated level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We listen to people like Senator Brown arguing in the most simplistic and childlike terms about the environment&mdash;what we had from the Greens and the Democrats. This is not what the public want to hear. They know that that sort of nonsense has passed, that these immature allegations were slung around 15 or 20 years ago. People are now genuinely concerned about improving the environment. They know there are no simple quick fixes. They know that most of the things that led us into trouble in the past were the consequence of a lack of education and ignorance as to what the long-term consequences were. But enough of the debate on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this bill is to establish the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia. It is also designed to implement the Commonwealth government's policies with respect to expenditure of funds for the protection and rehabilitation of Australia's environment. In doing so, this bill establishes the Natural Heritage of Australia reserve. It provides for funds in the reserve to be invested and for the outcome from such investments to be returned to the reserve. It establishes a natural heritage ministerial board and provides for the tabling of an annual report to the parliament, and ensures accountability to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An initial $1 billion, which is to be sourced from the partial sale of Telstra, is to be invested in the trust. For those who complain about putting $1 billion into the environment, I ask them: where else would we get $1 billion from in the straitened circumstances in which the Labor Party has left us? It was really a very intelligent and creative move of the government to earmark part of the sale of Telstra for this environmental purpose. Quite clearly, if Labor had got it they would have gone off on some wild scheme that would have wasted the money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some $700 million of this $1 billion has been specifically earmarked for five projects 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="832"> which are being conducted over the five&hyphen;year period 1996-97 to 2001. These are: a major national vegetation initiative, the Murray Darling 2001 project, a national land and water resources audit, the national reserve system and a coast and clean seas initiative. Funding is also to be provided through the reserve for a number of other programs, including a national river care initiative, a national landcare program, an endangered species program, a national wetland program, a national weed strategy, a national feral animal control strategy, farm forestry, world heritage area management, waste management awareness and an air pollution in major cities program&mdash;all very worthy projects and of great value to the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any terms this is an important piece of legislation, establishing a vital mechanism for the repair, maintenance and sustainability of our natural heritage. These objectives can be achieved with major economic benefits to our nation, including the creation of employment for our fellow Australians, particularly in regional areas. I might interpose a comment at this time. The legislation will do something to remedy the mistakes of the past 20 years by both state and federal governments which has seen a belief in the centralisation of all activities in either the state capitals or the federal capital of Canberra. Australia simply cannot be run that way. It has been a grievous policy for all of Australia's country towns. Any program for the care and protection of our natural environment that we put in place must also reflect our role in the global village, for all environment issues are of concern to mankind. This then is a very positive way for the coalition to take this country into the new millennium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take some time to refer to the coalition's environmental record. It is hardly surprising that a major initiative like this came from our side of politics because we have a very impressive record in environmental matters. Rather than the ongoing rhetoric we hear ad nauseam from the other side we have always chosen to act positively and decisively on environmental matters. It was a coalition government which established the first federal department to include over 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sight of the environment; it was a coalition government which made the first government grants to significant voluntary conservation organisations; it was a coalition government which pioneered the first listings under the world heritage convention: the Great Barrier Reef; Kakadu Stage I and the Willandra Lakes. Lord Howe Island and the Tasmanian wilderness were listed in 1982. It was a coalition government which stopped sandmining on Fraser Island and which led the charge to ban commercial whaling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legislation such as the Antarctic Treaty Act, the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act, the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act, the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act and the States Grants (Air Quality Monitoring) Act were moved by coalition governments. It was a coalition government which gave the Murray River Commission the power of water quality management back in 1982, the same year we initiated the national tree program and in which marine nature reserves were established. Our record, our credentials and, importantly, our leadership on these issues are a matter of historical record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, it is a coalition government which is taking the vital decisions here today to ensure that Australia is better placed to move into the new century. Like all Australians, we in the coalition are well aware that we need to make the care and restoration of our land, the restoration of our waterways, the maintenance of biodiversity, land care and the proper management of our coastal zone major priorities. We recognise that the extensive and continuing loss of Australia's vegetation cover is one of the most significant environmental and economic problems facing our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My own state of Queensland has a high land clearance rate and since European settlement the Australian landscape has changed dramatically. Australia has lost much of its native vegetation. Some 50 per cent of tall forests and 30 per cent of woodlands have been cleared or severely modified. It is estimated that over 50 per cent of Australia's land is now in need of some form of repair. The direct annual cost of soil and water degradation is in excess of $1.4 billion. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="833"> Pollution and erosion are threatening our rivers and coastlines.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are faced with the continuing degradation of riparian and riverine environments as evidenced by algal blooms, a decline in water quality, a deterioration of wetlands and river flora, bank erosion and declining fish stocks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most notable outbreaks of blue&hyphen;green algal bloom in 1991 extended over a thousand kilometres along the Darling River from Mungindi on the Queensland&hyphen;New South Wales border downstream to Wilcannia. The problems for the Murray&hyphen;Darling basin alone are well known to all of us here. The cost of that is significant, in the area of hundreds of millions of dollars. Along our coastline which supports 85 per cent of the Australian population are areas which require vegetation. There are also too many areas known to be polluted too heavily, thus threatening our marine biodiversity, all of which will come under the spotlight of the coalition's environmental programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All Australians today are concerned about their environment yet after 13 years of the Labor government which was characterised by a neglect of the environment we still have these increasing areas of land and water degradation. Vast tracts of Australia are being affected by rising water tables, salinity, soil erosion, noxious weeds and feral animals. I would like to say something about noxious weeds because as a grazier I have a great concern about the spread of noxious weeds which is taking such a huge toll of good grazing land in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own state we have a major problem with rubbervine. It is estimated that over half a million square kilometres of Queensland pastoral land is covered by rubbervine at the present time. Rubbervine is a native of Madagascar. I find it quite an unattractive looking plant, maybe because I know what it does to good grazing land. It has a white and pink flower that looks a bit like an oleander. It was imported years ago and is spreading rapidly across the tropical parts of Queensland&mdash;and it is very hard to control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another great problem we have is parthenium which allegedly was brought in with stockfeed to the Northern Territory and has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> now spread extensively into Queensland, particularly into the central highlands area around Emerald&mdash;and I am sorry to hear it has spread to New South Wales. It is a huge problem and, again, it is very expensive and difficult to clear. We are losing huge parts of good grazing land as a consequence. They are only two of the problems. It is estimated that the cost of weed infestation is about $3.3 billion a year to Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation has added poignancy at the present time because we have had a rural decline&mdash;the greatest in living memory. We have had a five&hyphen; or six&hyphen;year drought in the great cattle lands in Central Queensland. The wool industry is in desperate shape, and it has been for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that pastoralists simply do not have the income to cope with the very expensive business of weed eradication. The other thing is that, despite the droughts and the rest of it, weed infestation seems to propagate in harsh conditions. There really is an enormous problem out there which goes quite unrecognised in the greater part of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We come to the matter of national parks. Everyone supports national parks, but the people who own the national parks, the state governments, are very unconcerned about controlling weed or feral animal infestation in them. The Aboriginal community, which owns about 12 per cent of Australian lands, believes that all weed infestation is a matter for the state or the Commonwealth to deal with, not for themselves as landlords.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing a lot of these weeds now becoming herbicide resistant&mdash;the so&hyphen;called super weeds&mdash;and we find that legislation on weed management between the states and the federal government is either inadequate or inefficient. For example, to revert to the rubbervine problem, it is banned in Queensland but it is sold in New South Wales and I think in all other Australian states as an ornamental flower.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is estimated that of the approximately 1,900 plant species introduced into Australia since European settlement about half of that 1,900 are now regarded as weeds. Of that half, at least 220 species have been declared as noxious weeds. So we have a very serious 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="834"> problem, and this bill will do something to address that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While all of us have differing views on exactly what the priorities ought to be&mdash;and Senator West was very concerned about the priorities for the expenditure of this money in terms of the details&mdash;I think there is no&hyphen;one in the parliament who would deny the importance of the trust and what the legislation sets out to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of us can afford to be part of a generation which has passed on to the next an environment which is in far worse condition than was handed on to us when we were born. Our country's size, age and fragility impose very special conditions on all of us. In introducing this bill, the coalition recognises the obligation that is incumbent on all of us and has demonstrated the leadership and the determination required to tackle the environmental problems which plague Australia and which therefore impact on us internationally.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In closing the second reading debate on the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill, I thank all of those who have contributed. I do not want to delay the committee stage, because I think it is at that stage that we will be moving into some new ground. Most of the contributions that I heard tended to cover the old issues: the funding base, the purpose of the trust and&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;a touch of domestic politics or two from Senator Faulkner. Having said that, I understand that that is part and parcel of this process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are obviously very committed to this bill. We think it is a wonderful chance and a unique opportunity to put in place a capital fund to reinvest in our natural heritage. It is possible to debate the detail but we have identified areas where we believe a capital replenishment is particularly in the national interests. We have committed ourselves to spend only the receipts of capital sale on capital projects, and thus we have structured the bill in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the total quantum of the trust over a period of five years will consist not only of the capital but also of the interest that is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> earned on that capital plus some further contribution from the current expenditure. Over the period of the trust that will total expenditure of $1.249 billion, which will allow us to have $300 million in reserve at the end of that period. So it is a large sum of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not quarrel with those who say that you could spend a lot more on Australia's natural heritage. We have done a lot of damage to it in the past. The Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin itself could absorb that sum of money and you could still find good use for much more without having returned the environment to the state in which it was before we started to develop it for our economic benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have not well understood the state of Australia's natural environment, the consequences of the aged soils, the role our rivers and streams have played in cleansing the system of excess salt and so forth. So our interference&mdash;for good reason in terms of building an economy and creating wealth and providing opportunities for people&mdash;has caused inadvertent consequences that have done very significant damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is good is that governments and communities are now prepared to work together to rebuild that natural environmental base, and that in turn will help sustain primary production in the future whilst at the same time enabling us to pass on to future generations a state of natural heritage which is better than that which we inherited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We conceived the notion of the trust very proudly before the last election, and it is very much supported by the Australian community. We are pleased to have been able to establish a base from which we could obtain the capital necessary to set it up, and really that is a debate of the past, this parliament having agreed to the sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra, $1.1 billion of which will be reinvested in this fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is really about the administration of that fund, the purposes for which it is to be expended, the way in which it is to be administered, the structure of accountability and matters of that nature. So I look forward to the detail of the committee stage. I hope this parliament will support the bill and it will be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="835"> set up. Although we will start funding the trust from the beginning of the next financial year, we expect to be in a position to start investing much larger sums in programs and projects pursuant to the aims and objectives of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So time is running tight, but we have not been wasting time in the meantime. We have been getting the processes under way. We have been holding very constructive discussions with the states. We are in the process of working up the partnership agreements through which much of the proceeds of the trust will be disbursed. Relations with the states in that area have been very good. Relations with community organisations have been very good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not wanting to anticipate this parliament, we have nevertheless already advertised for community grants under the trust. Those advertisements were in last weekend's papers around Australia. The community that has been crying out to be part of this exciting project will now have a new opportunity to come on board and work with us to achieve these goals. So I thank honourable senators who have contributed to the debate and wish the bill a speedy passage.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I will speak to these three amendments collectively, as they are all interrelated. Democrat amendment No. 1 puts the word `environment' firmly into the bill. The term `heritage' is used for a wide range of different things. We refer frequently to Aboriginal heritage. We talk about a range of different heritage buildings and heritage trusts, and I think that

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some argue that the word `natural' covers it. We argue strongly that it only goes part of the way, that it does not cover it fully. The Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act is one example.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would support the amendments moved by the Democrats because I think there is a great deal of focusing required here. We have just listened to a second reading speech in which the minister totally failed to answer any of the concerns expressed elsewhere in this chamber. He totally ignored them. It was as though there was not any debate in here today at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He just got up and said what a good thing the bill will be, how people are looking forward to spending this money and it is a pity there have been `inadvertent consequences' of activities of the past. When it comes to focusing his own mind on the environment, we might ask him about the `inadvertent consequences' of his current actions such as licensing the flattening of world heritage forests in Tasmania and national estate forests elsewhere around the country, inevitably diminishing the biodiversity of this country as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We might ask him about the consequences of moving, as he is, towards the establishment of uranium mining at Jabiluka. I suppose one day he will be talking about the `inadvertent consequences' of that activity. It is as though there is no culpability in what he is doing to the environment in this country. It is as though nothing of the past is happening now. It is as though there is no damage to the environment coming out of his own actions, out of the actions of this government and out of the failure of this government to regulate to try to cut back greenhouse gas emissions, pollution of our cities, destruction of natural 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="836"> cover, vegetation cover, of the country, export of uranium and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would totally support the Democrats' move to try to focus his mind on the fact that this ought to be a bill not just about the heritage of this country but about the environment of this country. It might seem splitting hairs to him, but I think the more the word `environment' actually comes before him in this committee stage the more it might remind him that he has responsibilities that he is selling out in this country. Spending money on trying to repair the damage of the past ought to be a reminder to him that we should be stopping the damage at the moment if we are not going to run up an even bigger need for spending like this in the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Brown wants to use the opportunity of this committee debate to restate his very narrow and prejudiced views on a whole range of subjects. I will try to avoid being tempted. Just let me touch upon it by saying that the regional forest agreements that we are seeking to negotiate have the purpose of setting up a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system that will be the envy of most of the world and also of ensuring that forests that are harvested are harvested in an ecologically sustainable way. So most reasonable Australians would say the objectives are very sensible and worth applauding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leaving that to one side, I oppose the amendment of the Democrats, largely because the expression of the Natural Heritage Trust is now well appreciated and understood within the community. As I have said, we have started the process of engaging the community in this partnership with governments. To accept this amendment at the moment would simply be confusing. `Natural heritage' is an expression that is clear to all Australians. It fits very well with the concept of reinvesting in that heritage, which is what we are seeking to do. We recognise the mistakes of the past and are putting in place a capital fund to reinvest in a particular aspect of our heritage. In this instance, it is not the built heritage&mdash;that is another project&mdash;but the natural heritage.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that basis, the government would much prefer to leave the expression as it is. It is the expression that we took to the people at the election and have used ever since.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened with interest to the debate, which is seeking to effectively rename the Natural Heritage Trust Fund to the natural environment trust fund. I accept part of the argument put forward by Senator Hill. The coalition did make clear its intention to establish a Natural Heritage Trust. It used that terminology throughout the election campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators in the chamber are entitled to be surprised that this commitment is probably going to be defined as one of the core election commitments and that the government will stick with this one. But there is some substance to the argument that Senator Hill mounts. I might also say that there is some substance in the points that have been presented by others contributing to this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I made very clear in my speech on the second reading debate, from the opposition's perspective, we too are very concerned about the lack of environmental commitment by this government. There will be opportunities throughout this committee stage debate, in perhaps more substantive ways than by the title of the trust, to really have the government demonstrate that level of commitment. It is for those reasons that the opposition will oppose these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want our opposition to these three amendments to be misunderstood in any way. As far as I am concerned, there are very serious questions over this government's commitment to the environment. I think the record of the Howard government's environment minister is, frankly, abysmal.

As you read through the bill, it is surprising to note how few times the word `environment' occurs. We have phrases like `rural heartland' and a whole range of descriptions. As we will see when we get further into this committee process, unless we tie down some of these definitions so that they mean something and we can point to what the states and regions are or are not doing, it will be very difficult for us to see exactly where this money is going and what sort of an impact it is having.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to Tasmania, what Senator Alston said in summing up on the debate on the bill for the partial sale of Telstra was that we had been convinced that there was sufficient merit in the claims of Tasmania that warranted an expenditure of 10 per cent of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="838"> total trust funds. That case had been developed largely out of the fact that Tasmania has committed a much greater part of its landmass to the preservation of natural heritage and that it had been at a significant cost to its economy. It is an economy that is not as strong as the economies of some other parts of Australia and there was more than ample opportunity to invest one&hyphen;tenth of the total fund in very worthwhile capital projects within Tasmania. That was the basis on which that decision was made.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I would be interested to hear the minister say in what way there has been considerable cost to Tasmania in protecting its natural assets. The argument, as I see it, is that Tasmania has advanced greatly, as far as its future economic wellbeing is concerned, by, for example, forgoing an extra $1 billion in debt which would have come out of building the Franklin Dam. If you look at the west coast of Tasmania, the one town that is going ahead there, in economic and employment terms, is Strahan, which gets value from the 100,000&hyphen;plus a year tourists going through to see the world heritage area. I think it is just a lot of codswallop&mdash;it is a throw&hyphen;off, cavalier statement&mdash;to say that if you are protecting the environment you are not working in the interests of the economy. I would have thought the Minister for the Environment would have got past that sixties or pre&hyphen;sixties concept, which is no longer valid or accepted as valid by many of the most eminent economists in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That being said, however, in answer to a specific question, the minister said that Tasmania had set aside more of its land area than any other state. That may well be the case but that is thanks to the enormous contribution from conservationists and the populace in general in Tasmania, even against prevailing governments. Does that mean that the money is going to be apportioned according to the land area that is protected for each state and could the minister, in particular, say what it was in Tasmania's favour that has led to this outcome? What specifically determined in the minister's mind that an extra $100 million&mdash;

But what I want the minister to do is to explain more precisely what these reasons are. What was it that changed his mind? What did Senator Harradine say that changed the minister's mind that was not already obvious to anybody who is observing environmental events in this country? Before Senator Harradine approached the government, it was quite clear that Tasmania had a prodigious amount of national park&mdash;vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis other states; it certainly has got a long way to go.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, I would ask the minister to table the indicative list from the Tasmanian government. That said, of course I understand that there is an economic value, in dollar terms, to world heritage forests that the woodchip industry wanted to get at. But that is about where it stopped. What the minister apparently does not know&mdash;or chooses to ignore&mdash;is that this has been of precious little good to the average Tasmanian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, between 1970 and 1990&mdash;the first 20 years of the export woodchip operation&mdash;the Forestry Commission in Tasmania ran up a debt approaching half a billion dollars. In effect, what was happening was that the Tasmanian people were paying to have a natural resource, the wild forests, cut down and exported to the paper mills of the northern hemisphere, while these out&hyphen;of&hyphen;state corporations like North Broken Hill and Northern Woodchips, as it was&mdash;it is Boral nowadays&mdash;made a fat profit, which they also repatriated north of Bass Strait. In the meantime they were shedding some 5,000 jobs out 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="840"> of the industry as they cut the trees faster. If that is the sort of economic benefit that the minister supports, he and I do have a difference of opinion. They were downing the great job prospects to the state of these forests left vertical by paying people to knock them down and take them horizontal to the woodchip mills around the state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not swallow for one minute this paternalistic attitude that comes from the industry&mdash;which has obviously twigged the minister's ear&mdash;that logging of wild forests is per se a good economic activity, because it is not. But beyond that there are other values which future generations ought to be afforded&mdash;the minister may well look down when I speak of those&mdash;like beauty, diversity, inspiration and adventure in these grand, wild forests. We also gain something as human beings if we leave space on this planet for some of our 30 million fellow species to be able to persist into the future. Those are values that are left out of the equation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very surprised that the minister has not risen to extol the virtues of having forests kept, because that is his bailiwick. The fault is that he has not been able to go into cabinet and defend that bailiwick. He is no doubt going to monotonously reiterate that I think it is a bad thing that money be spent on the environment. I have said at the outset&mdash;and I will continue to repeat it&mdash;that that is a good thing. But the problem with this money is that it was not money that the government had said would go to the environment. It was blackmail. It was greenmail, if you like. The minister might remember a conversation we had about this last year in Hobart in which this was discussed&mdash;he was nodding his head then, as he is now&mdash;and where it was said that the two things, the sale of Telstra and putting the money out to the environment, might have been better not linked together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sad thing is that, it was straight after that meeting we had, that he flew out and stood in the middle of world heritage value forest outside the world heritage area which has been flattened and he flew back here after that. So far as I know, it did not impress him at all because it has made no difference. He has been one of the arbiters of even more 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rapid destruction of world heritage value forests since.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a great idea to be spending money on the environment. But you do it because the environment deserves it; you do not do it because you want to get one more vote in the Senate to get through the sale of a public asset like Telstra. That is the reason this extra money has gone to Tasmania. Let us not pussyfoot around: it was in the form of a hand across to get a vote through this Senate; it was not because the environment deserved it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not try to kid me, environment minister&mdash;through you, Mr Temporary Chair&mdash;that it was your bleeding heart for the environment that stirred you to give extra money to Tasmania because that is patently untrue. You ought to be ashamed of yourself that you could get up and even imply that that is the case. Of course it is not. There is hardly a person who has been watching the progress of this event in this country who would be fooled by you implying that it was your environmental concern for Tasmania that got this extra money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, Senator Harradine acted as an arbiter in this and that meant you got your Telstra legislation through. But it is a pretty sad situation that it had to be the flogging off of a great national institution that got this money that has this bill before us.

We chose to do it this way to bring it home to the community that preserving our natural capital is essential to maintain the life systems, such as sustainable agriculture, to which other aspects of the bill relate. One of the problems facing Australian primary production is that the natural capital has been utilised and the life systems broken down and simply pouring on more fertiliser has not resolved the problem. The need to preserve that natural capital is essential if we are going to be able to maintain sustainable material benefits&mdash;I am talking about material benefits; do not get me wrong, the benefits of the heart are important also&mdash;and the material benefits will only be maintained if the natural capital infrastructure that we inherited in this country is not run down but rather maintained.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lees asked during the last delivery whether a river or forests are infrastructure. Of course they are.

Occasionally you can put your hand on the left side of your chest and say, `We have to remember the values of the heart as well,' so that you cover that territory. From my beliefs and the Australian Greens' point of view, referring to the natural environment as capital infrastructure reveals just how far off line this government is when it comes to the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nature is more than that. It is something that gives us life, gives us everything we have got, without which we could not exist, without which we would not be here. It is our origins, our future, our wellbeing and our potential fulfilment. It is not just capital infrastructure.

I interrupted my own thought specifically to make clear to him that environment for the heart is just as important as environment for the maintenance of sustainable agriculture. But what Senator Brown refuses to understand is that both cost money. To maintain the vertical trees that Senator Brown talks about&mdash;to keep the weeds out and otherwise preserve and protect them&mdash;costs money which has to be raised by governments. As it has turned out, to protect the stream which at the moment is pumping salt onto the adjoining agricultural property costs money as well. We see all that as part of Australia's natural capital infrastructure for both the heart and material wellbeing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the opinion poll which came out last week&mdash;which the minister would do well to read&mdash;more Australians thought the environment was of supreme concern rather than the economy per se.

I did say that the minister put his hand to his heart and had one phrase 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="845"> in the middle of a lot of other explanation about capital infrastructure, but the terminology gives him away. It is an economic rationalist's and a user's piece of terminology, and it is at the heart of the problem that I foresee in the expenditure of this money. Ultimately, it is going to go where you can show there is an economic benefit&mdash;that is, money in somebody's pocket&mdash;coming out of its expenditure.

It brings to mind that captain of the Canadian logging industry who wanted to invest through Noranda in the Wesley Vale pulp mill in Tasmania back in 1989.

Someone who is a bete noire of the environment and environmentalists has been appointed to the key position of advising these two ministers about what is good for the Tasmanian environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we know from looking at this bill, it is not confined to spending money on the environment. Clause 17, which we will come to a bit later, makes clear the intention that it could be spent on land use, on the use of the waters and the atmosphere. I would be interested to know whether the minister thinks that the environmental capital infrastructure includes quarries, mines, dams and clear&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="851"> felled forest areas because there is no indication that they are off limits for spending as far as this bill is concerned as it stands at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There ought to be some checks in the bill. All parties and contingents on this side are pointing to the need for that. I submit to the committee that the best way for us to do that is to ensure that a board is set up which has expertise in the field. We have even been prepared to go so far as to allow the minister to appoint that board&mdash;because, under the Westminster system, it is very difficult to do anything else. It might be much better for the Senate or the parliament as a whole to be given charge of that&mdash;but you cannot work things that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we want is a board which has a membership made up of at least people who have the following characteristics:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an established interest in and demonstrated concern for environmental matters and has expertise and experience relevant to the proper discharge of the responsibilities of the Board.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Minister, this would be a safeguard for you. I would like to hear what argument there is against it. We are not talking about token amounts; we are talking about $1 billion plus of taxpayers' money and we are talking about the national environment. This money ought to be disbursed with some independence and known expertise. The right thing ought to be seen to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am amazed that the government, in its wisdom, has not established such a board&mdash;but, clearly, that wisdom is lacking. We put forward this pivotal amendment to this legislation to at least try to get towards ensuring that environmental expertise has a say at the outset and at the end of the day in determining where this vital disbursement of funds goes.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After due consideration, the opposition has decided to support the Greens' amendment to establish a natural heritage trust board which consists of seven nominees of the minister for the environment, each with expertise and experience relevant to the trust's goals and objectives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="852">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The objective of the board would be to allocate the funds from the reserve in accordance with the purposes of the reserve listed in clause 8 of the bill and to provide a forum for consultation on all matters relating to the responsibility of the trust. The board would also be required to provide the minister for the environment with an annual report on the operation of the trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The establishment of an independent board which includes people with expertise in the environment and sustainable agriculture would ensure greater accountability and transparency of the trust's operations. The bill currently provides for a board that we have heard from the minister as comprising him and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. That board apparently is to provide a forum for consultation between the two ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it would really just be an exercise in Senator Hill going along and getting his riding instructions from Mr Anderson and the National Party, because he has been absolutely dominated in every single internal government forum and process that has been in place since this coalition government was elected. He has an absolutely perfect score in being rolled by Mr Anderson and Senator Parer on all issues of consequence to the environment&mdash;an absolutely perfect score. I have no doubt, Senator Hill, that you are very unlikely to break your duck in relation to the level of influence that you have in this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very clear that an independent board would guard against the reserve being used for purely political purposes and would ensure that money was allocated on the basis of need. Frankly, the bill currently does not have any guarantees that funds will be disbursed on the basis of need. A board would also provide leadership and direction which this trust fund clearly lacks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guide to Community Group Applications</EMPHASIS> document, the glossy document which the government released last week on the natural heritage trust, provides, as I see it, no leadership or direction for the trust whatsoever.</PARA>

You never know, you might be able to help us. That document just seems to list off the types of projects that community groups could receive funding for. There is no indication of priority or of how projects would be judged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say to the minister at the table that the document did seem to me to somewhat pre&hyphen;empt decisions of the parliament. I suppose it is an indication of a touch of arrogance to release such a document before the legislation has even passed through the parliament. But you can explain yourself in that regard a little later perhaps, Senator Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a need for this trust to include accountability and transparency measures. It is a most important need that I do not think can be underestimated. Unless very strong accountability mechanisms are included in the bill, the trust funds will not be directed on a needs basis to address the very serious environmental problems that face Australia. Of course, the concern is there that this government will act in a purely political way in relation to the activities, without this sort of mechanism in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I just have absolutely no confidence at all in Senator Hill and Mr Anderson working together. I use the word `together' advisedly because they do not seem to have the capacity. I do not know how they can sit in a room together. They always seem to be fighting and spatting about different things but, then again, Senator Hill just rolls over at the end of the debate or the argument. It is a most interesting approach for the Minister for the Environment to take.</PARA>

It is important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know it is a laughing matter to you, but others in the community actually think it is important and I do not think any fair minded person could have any faith in a board comprising you and Mr Anderson&mdash;Senator Hill and Mr Anderson, a board responsible for the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia. That is a real worry. I think the arguments for establishing a Natural Heritage Trust Board which consists of seven nominees of the Minister for the Environment&mdash;and you will be pleased to see that I acknowledge it is important that the Minister for the Environment deserves a role there&mdash;is a step in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think you need that sort of help and support, Senator Hill. It would be a sensible thing for you to embrace this amendment. You might be able to actually throw a few back against Mr Anderson in relation to these internal battles. We have an environment minister who does not seem to be able to win any battles in debates with his ministerial colleagues or in the cabinet. This is a very, very important accountability mechanism.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Amendment No. 2 from the Greens sets out the objectives of the board. Let me reiterate to the committee what the board is. It is really two ministers, the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson). As the bill stands, it seems that they arbitrate on where the money goes. They have vague directions. We believe that that is far from good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this amendment, we set out some objectives for those two ministers to follow. These include the protection of Australia's natural environment; that would seem obvious enough, but it is not confined to that as far as this legislation is concerned. Others are to carry out Australia's international obligations under international treaties such as the world heritage convention, Ramsar for the protection of biodiversity and the protection of wetlands, and international treaties for the protection of biodiversity. The guidelines also implement government election promises on such things as the Murray-Darling, the natural vegetation initiative and the national reserve system and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would expect that the government would support this amendment. Basically, it is putting in place what the government says is its intent. It might confine it a bit. It might not leave open natural resources management to the wide  interpretation which no doubt these ministers will give it further down the line, where they can later channel money into logging, mining and damming operations and all manner of things, even the removal of natural vegetation. But it does give effect to the mouthings of the government, including 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="855"> the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), on the commitment they say they have to the environment and to this money reaching the environmental wellbeing of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recommend this amendment. It will give some security to these ministers. They ought to be welcoming it. I hope that Senator Harradine might even vote for this part. He is very strong on public accountability, and you cannot have accountability if you do not have guidelines and you do not know where you are going. So I commend this amendment to the committee. I will be looking for the support of the committee and seeing a change made to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the dinner adjournment I was pointing to the need for the board, which will consist of the minister purportedly responsible for the environment and the minister for agriculture, to have direction. This amendment from the Greens gives at least some direction. It provides that in the disbursement of the funds from the reserves the objectives of the two ministers, who are called, curiously, `a board' from here on, are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to protect and conserve the natural environment of Australia&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second component of the purposes outlined here is that of the reserve itself.

These are the government's own election promises. What we have here is a set of objectives for the board which reflect either the government's own position or Australia's accepted obligations under international conventions.

I would submit that that is in fact already in the bill but in a much more comprehensive form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the honourable senator reads clause 8, it sets out the purposes of the reserve, such as the national vegetation initiative. Then if he reads on to the relevant part of the bill he will find out what the natural vegetation initiative is and the primary objective of it. That one is under clause 10, and the objective is to reverse the long&hyphen;term decline in Australia's native vegetation cover by conserving remnant vegetation, conserving Australia's biodiversity and restoring by means of revegetation the environmental values, et cetera. In the same way the Murray&hyphen;Darling project is defined, as is the land and water resources project. You can find the national reserve project under clause 13, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of the Act, the primary objective of the National Reserve System is to assist with the establishment and maintenance of a comprehensive, adequate and representative system of reserves.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, what Senator Brown is seeking is already in the bill but in a much more comprehensive form. So I see no point in that addition at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second substantive amendment states that the objectives of the board are to assist the Australian government to implement Australia's obligations under the international conventions. That is different because we

But we are not doing it because of an obligation to comply with international obligations; we are doing it because of our desire to protect and enhance the Australian environment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I say you need objectives, Minister: you need at least some definition of where this money is going to go to because you do not know where it is going to. You waffle there on your feet and think you might, under certain circumstances, be able to see a situation in which money could be spent on rehabilitating mines, rehabilitating hydro roads and so on. But it needs definition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I ask you another question: without objectives like the ones we are putting forward in this amendment, could money be spent by the Tasmanian authorities on the upkeep of the so-called `road to nowhere' through the Tarkine wilderness? The state government spent $34 million of taxpayers' money on a road that even the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> columnist, Patsy Crawford, absolutely lambasted in the paper on Sunday as a terrific waste of money and an environmental disaster. It is there; it has been bulldozed through.

So there will be money under this fund invested off&hyphen;reserve.

I just want to point out, Minister, that we may not be talking about a large sum of money. From speaking to people in Tasmania, some of what they need is support for fencing, some of it is a small amount of money to relocate existing activities such as grazing of cattle. So it may be quite significant areas. Looking at the amount of public land that is being clear&hyphen;felled in Tasmania, significant areas, I understand, are still on private land.

<PARA STYLE="Para">I consider these two amendments to be perhaps the most important ones I have moved tonight. I will speak to amendment No. 10 first. This aims to link directly the national biodiversity strategy into this act. It was a Commonwealth initiative and, I understand, quite an expensive initiative to set this up. A lot of work has been done. A lot of work has gone into getting this under way and, indeed, it would be a waste, a mistake, not to formally link this back into the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Referring to the national biodiversity strategy makes a Natural Heritage Trust Fund Bill more cohesive, comprehensive and a much more effectively connected document. To just refer to the need to conserve Australia's biodiversity is far too weak&mdash;a parenthood statement, if you like. I and the Democrats

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 17, again, basically is another measuring stick. It seeks to link the biodiversity money into tangible outcomes. There was a commitment by the coalition to take on board the biodiversity strategy by the year 2000&mdash;and I notice somehow that the actual time line has disappeared out of the bill. The deadlines in a number of areas do not seem to be there. We argue that, without the guide of the strategy and without the time line, it becomes another very weak, almost meaningless parenthood statement which is open to vast interpretation. I believe that we will not achieve the goals we are setting out to achieve unless we link directly back into the biodiversity strategy that is already there.</PARA></SPEECH>

But there is a lot more to biodiversity than that, the whole animal realm being one example. If we can be specific about it, we ought to be. I do not know why on this point we do not take up the Democrats' very good suggestion and tie it into a strategy that we know, that is delineated and, what is more, has targets.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With this amendment what concerns me is what might not be included. We certainly have expressed it in general terms and I think what we have said covers everything that Senator Lees would wish us to be achieving through this particular program; that is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to contribute to the rehabilitation of the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin, with a view to achieving a sustainable future for the Basin, its natural systems and its communities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So it is all there. What Senator Lees seeks to do is to be more specific. But when you do that, you immediately ask the question, `What has been missed out?'  Certainly protecting and restoring river frontage vegetation is important, but so are a hundred other environmental rehabilitation programs within the basin. That is the danger, it seems to me. I think I understand what Senator Lees is seeking to do, but we will only end up with a debate about items that are not included. I notice she has linked together (a) to (d), so presumably they have all got to be demonstrated to exist before the funding can be contributed. Rather than do this and add further uncertainty, I would urge her to stick with our general wording. Everybody knows what it is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went to the election with the Murray-Darling 2001 project. We named it. You know the history of that project. It was originally advanced by Dean Brown. It was picked up by the Commonwealth and the other states. Under this program we committed ourselves to contribute $150 million. It is being matched by the states. There is now a funding pool of $300 million to build on existing programs in the basin. So it is a substantial and very worthwhile program. The states which are partners in the Murray-Darling Basin Commission know what it is all about and are planning for it. Having spent two days in the basin last week with the ministerial council, I know that local commu 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="871"> nities are enthusiastic. They know what it is about. They are working on where they are going to fit into the remedial programs that are planned under the initiative of this particular project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really do not think it is sensible now, at this stage, to cast a new element of ambiguity into the program by seeking to be specific and ending up leaving something out, then finding that we want to support that and having to have an argument with the lawyers as to whether it has been excluded by drafting that we adopt tonight.</PARA></SPEECH>

I think he is  putting in a sterling performance tonight, given the lead in the saddlebags that he has got.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the opposition is concerned, I think this amendment proposed by Senator Lees genuinely does have merit. It quite clearly improves the bill's objective with regard to the Murray-Darling 2001 project to ensure ecologically sustainable objectives, such as environmental flows. It is important that those sorts of objectives are included, along with sustainable agricultural objectives. I think the case that has been mounted by Senator Lees in relation to this amendment is strong. For that reason, the opposition will be supporting the amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, I really must object to your suggestion that somehow, by being clearer&mdash;by making sure that we have not left out, in particular, the protection of flow or restoring of flow and habitat requirements for fresh water ecosystems&mdash;our amendment may cause any additional concerns; or that somehow, by moving this amendment, we have not taken regard of a range of other possibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look, in particular, at enhancing efficiency and sustainability in irrigated agriculture, there is an enormous range of practices, activities and requirements that are going to go into achieving that specific 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> objective. One of the complaints I have about this bill is that the objectives are far too vague, and people are going to sit around for quite some considerable time, I would imagine, arguing their way through them. It is all very well to give examples of communities who do know what they are doing&mdash;and I am sure you have representations from many of those who are ready, willing and able to go on to new irrigation projects. But we need to make sure that all money spent in the basin has specific objectives that we can measure, so we can sit back in two or three or five years time and say, `Yes, water quality was improved by that project' or, `Yes, they did specifically restore flow and improve habitat requirements.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I say again, Minister, I think your definition is far too broad. What we are doing is trying to make sure we have some more specific objectives to measure, hopefully, the success&mdash;we will say `the success'&mdash;of these programs against.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a very clear difference between what Senator Lees is sensibly putting forward and what the minister is setting out to allow happen. I come back again to his definition of `sustainable  agriculture'. A stand&hyphen;alone clause says that sustainable agriculture is:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the economic viability of agricultural production;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Democrats amendment, moved by Senator Lees, is getting rid of that to start off with and is putting the environment back into the equation. The environment is what this legislation purports to be about. This legislation, this $1 billion, is not going to be all things to all people, let alone to the environment. Senator Lees is dead right: the whole bill lacks definition, focus and direction. And here she is again trying to give it that focus and direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Even if all this money went to the purposes listed by Senator Lees in her amendment, it is doubtful that these four remarkably important achievements could be gained&mdash;but at least there is a limitation on where the money can go. It is a very sensible amend 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="872"> ment. It is very difficult to know why the minister should be objecting to it. The only conclusion one can come to is that he does not want any fetters put on the government as to where this money will go, and that is the true hallmark of a real political slush fund.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to what has been said. I cannot see the advantage of putting in the amendments that have been proposed by Senator Lees. The minister has made it perfectly clear that the broad manner in which the bill is drawn at the present moment is desirable. I can think of one particular example, and that is the eradication of European carp, that would come within the bill as it is stated at the present moment. As I see it, that is not specifically in the amendment, unless it comes into `restoring the flow and habitat requirements of freshwater ecosystems'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I first thought that Tasmania probably could not get any money from the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin 2001 project, but Tasmania can get money quite legitimately in respect of that particular program to eradicate the European carp. There is a localised population of European carp in Lakes Crescent and Sorell and, just as an example, an intensive eradication program in that system would provide lessons on the practicalities and efficiency of control options for future application to the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just in response to Senator Harradine's concern about the European carp and the damage they are doing: that particular concern would be met in our amendment under part (a), restoring the flow and habitat requirements; part (c), improving water quality; and also part (e), river frontage vegetation. Indeed, I have been asked on several occasions to look at issues relating to the carp.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the biggest problems is that, if the carp are allowed to breed up, not only do they damage the actual quality of the water but they also feed on the banks which causes sections of the banks then to collapse into the river. This creates further problems for those land-holders who have already fenced their frontages off and who are doing the right 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thing by replanting and keeping the stock back, only to see the carp come in from the riverside and eat sections of the bank away so that then they are back to square one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can assure Senator Harradine that the carp are more than adequately catered for in these amendments. We consulted with a wide range of groups and organisations to make sure that they did cover very succinctly everything that needed to be covered.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I again agree with Senator Lees on the matter. It is interesting with the carp that we potentially have a multi million&mdash;if not multi billion&mdash;dollar problem in Tasmania due to laxity of quarantine measures and lack of teeth in legislation. It is a good/bad example of where environmental repair has no chance of substituting for proper regulation by government. That is one of the reasons why this legislation as a stand alone is going to fail to achieve the purpose, which the government thinks it is going to achieve, of even denting the environmental problems this country has got.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also take the opportunity of asking Senator Harradine, again in relation to the Tasmanian matters, whether he might table the parameters for spending of the money in Tasmania that he was able to work on and come to agreement with with the state government. I presume his silence on that will mean that he is not going to table it. But I think that would be a good measure in public information. I support the amendment.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="873"> Nombiniso Gasa to the media in South Africa on 23 July 1997. She says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of you will be wondering why I have consented to my name being revealed. Many of you will be wondering why I have come back to this place and why so soon?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have decided to come out publicly with my experience because, as my sisters have said, I do not want to carry the burden of silence. I do not want to be burdened by shame that is usually carried by women who have gone through this experience. I do not want to be reduced to merely being a victim.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have decided to talk about my experience because I feel that the rapist, whether he is arrested or not, wherever he is, has to deal with the human aspect of his assault. I do believe that my name being mentioned and my talking publicly may force him and others like him to confront what they have done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have also chosen to talk about my experience, to reveal my identity, because I do not want to be another statistic. I am a person not just a number and society has to deal with that.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have come back to Robben Island, soon perhaps, but I feel that I need to reclaim this place. To reassert my right to be here and to reassert the right of women to be wherever they like.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To be raped on Robben Island is in a sense of double violation&mdash;of myself as a person and of the attempts now being made to transform this island into a place of peace and tranquillity. This place has a history of pain and suffering and one would have thought that all South Africans want to embrace it as a significant symbol of our history, the process of reconciling and building peace in our country. To me Robben Island is sacred ground. It will remain so even after this experience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The struggle for change is painful, for all of us. I presume from what this man said to me that he himself is struggling with this. I am angry, very angry, that he chose to make my body his battle ground.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Constitution is praised for its advanced commitment to Women's Emancipation and Equality. But, change has to permeate all levels of society, especially those who implement the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this case the police men and women are amongst the first we have to deal with after rape. They deal with the extended rape. We expect them to equip themselves with an understanding of how to deal with women, young girls and babies in this situation. We expect them to treat us with care, gentleness and respect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope that this experience will help us all to recommit ourselves to condemn and stop rape and violence against women. I hope that our govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment will see violence against women as a priority. My experience is part of a broader context where women are denigrated, assaulted and used as scape goats.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am very angry that no one has been arrested yet. I want to believe that the police are doing their best. I do not want innocent people to suffer&mdash;so I hope they are being very thorough and that soon they will arrest my rapist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, I want to thank the Robben Island Museum Project for its support and concern. I want to thank Andre Odendaal in particular and the Department of Arts Culture Science and Technology, the Director General Roger Jardine who came down, Brigitte Mabandla the Deputy Minister for her support and solidarity. I also want to thank the President, Comrade Nelson Mandela the Deputy President, Comrade Thabo Mbeki for their warm messages of solidarity.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(a) Rather than referring all Defence activity proposals to the department responsible for the environment for decision regarding potential significance, the then Environment Minister and the then Minister for Defence agreed to a Memorandum of Understanding which was signed on 28 August 1991 which states that the decision as to whether a Defence proposal or activity is likely to affect the environment to a significant extent, may be taken by the Minister for Defence or his/her Ministry. This administrative procedure is consis 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="876"> tent with the requirements of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposal) Act 1974 which charges the action Minister to determine if a proposal should be referred to the Environment Minister. To assist Defence in assessing the significance of the affect of a Defence proposal on the environment, the Ministers agreed on broad guidelines. On the basis of these guidelines, it was agreed that if, `after full and proper consideration, taking into account all relevant environmental implications', Defence considered the environment would not be affected to a significant extent, the provisions of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 would be satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The Department of Defence, in agreement with the Environment Minister in 1980, introduced the Environmental Certificate of Compliance as a means of ensuring that the Department meets, and discharges its responsibilities, for environmental assessment under the provisions of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. The Environmental Certificate of Compliance is signed by the Department of Defence delegate when satisfied that all environmental aspects of a proposal have been adequately investigated, and that the action is not an environmentally significant action. The Environmental Certificate of Compliance conforms to Defence's requirements under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 and, therefore, does not require referral to the Minister responsible for the environment. In addition, this Certificate allows for conditions to be placed on the proposal that must be strictly adhered to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) The Assistant Secretary Resources and Project Management is the Departmental delegate responsible for approving and ensuring Exercise Tandem Thrust 97 is conducted in compliance with the conditions set in the Environmental Certificate of Compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a) and (b) A mixture of Australian Navy, Army and Air Force, and US Army, Navy, Marine and Air Force personnel will be based in Townsville (1,824), Rockhampton (1,280), Gladstone (937) and Amberley/Brisbane (1,134) during the exercise. These numbers are for the peak period 10&hyphen;22 March 1997. Numbers will begin to build from mid February, with all personnel departing by the end of March 1997. Up to two thirds of these personnel may be granted leave outside of normal working hours. A maximum of 8,609 personnel from all services will be located in the Shoalwater Bay Training Area (SWBTA) in the peak period 10&hyphen;22 March 1997. It is unlikely any of these personnel will be granted leave during this period. 13,126 Australian and US Navy personnel will be at sea during the exercise (all figures quoted in this paragraph are expected estimates, but are subject to change prior to and during the exercise). The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> personnel on ships at sea will conduct goodwill visits to Australian ports before and/or after the exercise. The ship visit program is still being developed and, therefore, arrival and departure dates have yet to be resolved. However, ships will be dispersed amongst ports to reduce the impact of the visits and spread the economic benefits to a number of communities. It is anticipated US Navy ships will visit Cairns, Brisbane, Sydney, Townsville, Hobart and Fremantle. The largest port visit is likely to be conducted by five US Navy ships to Sydney, a city well used to, and capable of, hosting this number of ships. Four Australian Navy ships will be conducting post exercise visits to Gladstone, Cairns and Brisbane. Up to two thirds of a ship's company may be granted leave at any one time during these visits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) With one exception, all activities associated with Exercise Tandem Thrust have been conducted in the SWBTA in the past. The new activity is to exercise the US Maritime Pre&hyphen;Positioning Force (MPF). This will involve the off load of MPF equipment and supplies at Freshwater Beach in the SWBTA, including the pumping of freshwater from a ship at anchor to the beach. This activity has not been conducted before in the SWBTA as the Australian Defence Force (ADF) does not possess this capability. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Queensland Department of the Environment conducted a feasibility study and comprehensive survey to determine the viability and preferred location for the conduct of the activity. It has also been briefed to the SWBTA Environmental Management Advisory Committee and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. All bodies involved and consulted have agreed to the conduct of this activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)(a) Exercise Tandem Thrust 97 is indeed a significant exercise, however, it is not the largest exercise to have been conducted in the SWBTA. Numerous Brigade and higher level exercises, and joint/combined exercises, have been conducted at SWBTA since June 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The Kangaroo Exercises were referred to the EPA under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. On the basis of information provided to the EPA by the Department of Defence, and in accordance with paragraph 3.1.1(a) of the Administrative Procedures, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories determined that neither a Public Environment Report nor an Environmental Impact Statement was necessary. The information provided to the EPA was prepared in consultation with the Australian Nature Conservation Agency, the Australian Heritage Commission, the Queensland Department of Environment (previously Environment and Heritage), the Western Australian Department of Environmental Protection, and the Conservation Commission of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="877"> the Northern Territory. The provisions of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 were satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)(a) and (b) The Exercise Plan and the subsequent Annex T (Environmental Annex) are United States documents, ie issued by the United States Exercise Executive (Commander Seventh Fleet) to Exercise participants, and includes some reference to operations. These documents are not normally released, however, I am happy to provide the Senate with the Executive Summary to the Environmental Assessment which includes the safeguarding measures in respect to the Exercise ( this document is attached at Annex A).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Exercise Tandem Thrust is a free play operational and tactical level exercise, where freedom of manoeuvre is essential for units to gain full value from the activity. The movement of the US submarine has not been pre&hyphen;scripted and a definitive answer to this question cannot be given. It is, however, the nature of nuclear&hyphen;powered submarine operations to avoid shallow or navigationally constricted waters. Additionally, the Australian Government has imposed restrictions on the use of most anti&hyphen;submarine sensors within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Exercise planners have consequentially designed the majority of the submarine activities to be well clear of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) Every port in Australia has a general plan which would apply in the unlikely event of an accident involving any conventional and nuclear&hyphen;powered foreign warship. The risk, however, of a major collision involving a foreign warship in an Australian port is considered to be very remote because of navigation practices and port restrictions on shipping movements. So remote are the risks, the Department of Defence assesses the chances of a contained accident occurring at less than 1 in 10,000 years, and the chances of an accident involving the release of radioactive material to be far more remote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) Yes (the map is attached at Annex B).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) The Australian Government does not have definitive information on this aspect of nuclear&hyphen;powered submarine operations. In any event, it is not anticipated that the US nuclear&hyphen;powered submarine will be operating in less than 50 fathoms of water during the exercise. Both Australia and the US have stringent safety procedures to minimise any risk for the environment and for its personnel. US nuclear&hyphen;powered ships and submarines have visited over 150 ports in over 50 countries around the world without experiencing a reactor accident of any sort that resulted in the release of radioactive material. Both the US and Australian Governments have complete confidence in these units and in the personnel who operate them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10)(a) and (b) The Environmental Monitoring Group (EMG) will assist in achieving the successful conduct of Exercise Tandem Thrust 97, by providing specialist and expert local environmental advice in support of Exercise Commanders and participating Units. The EMG will have both US and Australian components. The Head of the EMG will be the Director of Environment and Heritage from the Department of Defence, who will be the liaison point between the US and Australian components and the Combined Exercise Control Group. The EMG will be responsible for providing expert environmental advice, conducting environmental inspections before, during and after Exercise Tandem Thrust 97, responding to reported environmental incidents, and to be the key liaison point between the Exercise Commanders and the external stake holders. The EMG will be staffed by six US representatives and four Australian representatives. The US contingent will consist of environmental management specialists, with expertise in facilities engineering, hazardous waste management, hazardous materials management, land and sea oil spill management, and ground water and soil investigation. The Australian contingent will include the Director of Environment and Heritage from the Department of Defence, the SWBTA Environmental Management Officer, a South Queensland Logistics Group Engineer, and an expert on SWBTA from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. In addition, there will be constant liaison as required with representatives from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Queensland Department of the Environment, and a local civil engineering firm, prior to, during and after Exercise Tandem Thrust 97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11)(a) Australia and the US are expected to have an estimated 5,500 personnel and 20,500 respectively that will participate in the exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) No countries other than Australia and the US will be participating in this exercise (this includes observers).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(12) There is no intention for the US to preposition equipment in Australia as a result of Exercise Tandem Thrust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(13)(a) One Los Angeles Class nuclear&hyphen;powered submarine will participate in the exercise. It is US policy to neither confirm, nor deny, the carriage of nuclear weapons on US naval ships. The Australian Government accepts this policy and does not require the US to disclose whether nuclear weapons are on board their visiting warships. The Government is satisfied that the standards required by NATO countries, with respect to nuclear weapons safety, and with the safety precautions taken on board visiting warships, effectively preclude the possibility of an accidental nuclear detonation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) On 8 July 1996 the International Court of Justice handed down an advisory opinion as to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="878"> whether the threat or use of nuclear weapons is, in any circumstances, permitted under international law. The Court reached the conclusion that the use of nuclear weapons, in all but the most extreme circumstances, would be illegal. The Court was, however, unable to find any evidence suggesting that the possession of nuclear weapons is illegal under international law. The Court was not called upon to consider the legality of nuclear powered ships. Exercise Tandem Thrust does not include scenarios anticipating the use of nuclear weapons. The Australian Government does not consider that the presence of nuclear powered warships in Exercise Tandem Thrust is in breach of international law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(14) After full and proper consideration, taking into account all relevant environmental implications, Defence considers that the environment would not be affected to a significant extent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) On 11 November 1996, I announced that British Aerospace had been selected as the preferred tenderer to supply Hawk aircraft to replace the Macchi fleet in introductory fast jet pilot training and other ADF support tasks. The number of aircraft is subject to contract negotiations planned for April/May 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a) The contract and associated cost is yet to be negotiated with British Aerospace. The actual number of aircraft to be acquired will depend on the outcome of these negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Contract signature is expected at the scheduled conclusion of negotiations in May 1997. The first aircraft delivery is planned for mid 1999, with the first twelve aircraft deliveries to coincide with the introductory pilot course starting in early 2000. The remainder of the fleet is planned to be delivered over about eighteen months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)(a)(b) and (c) The request for tender required that operational level maintenance be conducted at the main RAAF operating locations, Williamtown (near Newcastle) and Pearce (near Perth), and that deeper level maintenance should be conducted by the preferred tenderer in Australia. British Aerospace has offered a maintenance and spare parts package which involves a number of Australian companies. However, details of the proposal, the companies involved and full contractual arrangements are still subject to negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The requirement to acquire a replacement for the Macchi aircraft, which was introduced into service in 1967, was determined through the normal defence force development and acquisition process, and was approved by the Government in the context of the 1995 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) British Aerospace was chosen as the preferred tenderer after detailed evaluation across a range of areas, including aircraft design and performance, acquisition and through life support costs, and Australian industry involvement proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6)(a) and (b) The Hawk is a training aircraft, designed to train pilots in fast jet handling and operational procedures before they progress to more sophisticated aircraft such as the F111 and F/A&hyphen;18. The Hawk will replace the existing Macchi training aircraft which have been in service for over 30 years, and have reached the limit of their structural life. Although the Hawk, with its modern systems, will enable better transition by trainee pilots to the F111, the acquisition of the aircraft is not directly related to the F111 upgrade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7)(a) and (b) Hawk aircraft are being acquired to satisfy ADF training and support requirements; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="894"> there are currently no plans for the aircraft to be used to train overseas pilots.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8)(a) The Defence requirement for the aircraft to be supported by Australian industry will lead to the establishment of an Australian servicing and repair capability for the Australian Hawk. There is potential for Australian companies involved to subsequently seek additional work in the region, which could include airframe, engine and avionics systems and component servicing and repair, and the provision of associated ground training system support.</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="896" SPEAKER="Parer, Sen Warwick" NAMEID="KI4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Resources and Energy" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator Parer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Regional control of Johne's Disease (JD) in sheep should proceed in the context of a broader, nationally coordinated approach. I will be taking this matter up with all my State/Territory counterparts at the 28 February 1997 meeting of the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ). My personal position is that the national approach for JD in sheep should include development of a market assurance program to identify properties where animals can be sourced with confidence that they are free of JD infection; achievement of common standards and quality control approaches for diagnostic tests; research into better technology for detecting JD; and harmonisation of individual State/Territory regulations concerning movement restrictions on infected animals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) State Governments have legislative powers and responsibilities to control a range of endemic diseases of livestock. Successful application of these powers and responsibilities to a regional program of eradicating JD from affected sheep could be expected to require a strong level of producer cooperation. This is unlikely to occur in the absence of any assistance to producers to offset the on&hyphen;farm costs incurred as a necessary result of complying with the eradication program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that the optimal decision by New South Wales would have been to pursue a more systematic control program in response to the initial detection of JD in sheep in 1980. However, in light of evidence of substantial spread from the original foci of infection, the NSW government and local industry interests embarked early last year on a fundamental rethink of their approach. I understand that an extensive monitoring program is now in train in NSW to clarify the geographic spread of the disease. The two main options identified for follow&hyphen;up field control (pending the results of the surveillance data) would be a State&hyphen;wide program of destocking of infected properties, or a `strategic'</PARA>
<PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="897"></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">approach involving containment of the disease to a clearly defined region in NSW. In the circumstances, it does not appear unreasonable for NSW to postpone a final decision on the detail of a regional control program until it has all the surveillance test results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) I believe that the decision ultimately taken by NSW government and industry interests on the two options outlined in (3) above should be based on a balanced assessment of technical and economic viability considerations. While the Victorian decision to initiate a destocking program for all infected properties in that State would seem to be justified on both of these considerations, the situation in that State obviously is more clear&hyphen;cut and amenable to a quicker decision than is possible in NSW.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) ARMCANZ Ministers and livestock producer interests have jointly established the Australian Animal Health Council Limited (AAHC) to provide professional development support work in the area of national animal health policy and programs. I do not think it would be sensible for ARMCANZ to set up its own sub&hyphen;committee to duplicate the services which are available from AAHC. Work already initiated by AAHC on the general question of JD in sheep includes an economic study to be completed by the end of April 1997. The cost&hyphen;benefit aspects of the economic study should underpin sound decisions on the design of national programs to support regional control programs funded by affected States. I also expect there will be an objective assessment of the flow of any external private or public benefits from regional control activity, which will provide a basis for determining whether a wider cost&hyphen;sharing arrangement should apply to these regional programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The Commonwealth funded its commitment to the national bovine brucellosis eradication program on a `pay as you go' basis, and has no left over funds. There is a surplus balance currently in the National Cattle Diseases Eradication Trust Account which was set up to receive cattle producer contributions to the bovine brucellosis program and the current bovine tuberculosis eradication campaign. However, Trust Account funds may be used only to deal with endemic cattle diseases.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
