<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this afternoon to discuss in some detail the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill, the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Incentives) Bill, the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, and the Taxation Laws Amendment (Private Health Insurance Incentives) Bill. It is very difficult to cover the broad scope of these bills within the time that will be allowed, but we will certainly make a reasonable attempt at it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I proceed, I would like to foreshadow two second reading amendments. The first amendment is to the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill); and the second amendment is to the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2). Those amendments have been circulated, or should be in the process of being circulated. In essence, they are the same as those already proposed in the House of Representatives.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Chapman)</NAME></TALKER>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="B36">Senator NEAL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not moving them, Mr Acting Deputy President; I was just 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> foreshadowing them in case they had not previously been brought to the attention of the Senate. The first two bills have the major effect of providing an incentive for those in the community who are believed to be in a low income area who seek private insurance. These incentives cut in at $35,000 for singles and at $70,000 for couples with an additional allowance of $3,000 per child.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These incentives are not being opposed by the opposition. We can see that these will be extraordinarily popular and will go some way to making it a little easier for members of the community to afford private health insurance. The major difficulty that we see with this proposal and the levy on high income earners is that, firstly, it does not deal with the fundamental problem of the collapse of the private health insurance industry, and, secondly, it does nothing to offset the difficulties being experienced in the public health system. In some ways, because of the way the promises of this government are being resourced, it may well be that these proposals will make the situation worse for private hospitals. That is where our major concern is in this entire package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election, the coalition promised that these incentives would not be funded from the public health system and that health grants to the states&mdash;other than the $50 million that came from the better practice program&mdash;would not be reduced. This has been shown in the first budget to be completely wrong. We are very fearful that there will be further cuts to health funding, particularly in the public health system, when the next budget comes out in only two months time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the coalition has cut, in an attempt to fund these unfunded incentives, $1.5 billion over three years. I am sure that everyone in the community would be well aware that taking out a large hunk of funding like that is not going to be insignificant, that the effect of taking out this sort of funding will mean that there will be a reduction in the level of services being provided to the community. The coalition has also cut $3 million over four years to hospital funding. This, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1048"> again, is going to have a major effect on the types of services that are being provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the issues we must look at is that although the provision of these sorts of incentives to singles, couples and families who take out private health insurance will be welcomed, will they have the effect of increasing the number of people who take out private health insurance or will they have the effect of reducing the number of people who are leaving private health insurance? I think that issue is extremely debatable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose the incentive of $125 for singles is a reasonable amount of money. But when you look at it in relation to what it actually costs you to take out private health insurance, it is really rather paltry. Obviously our private health insurance varies in cost, but most schemes for singles will cost well in excess of $1,000 a year. So we are looking at singles being paid an incentive of about one&hyphen;tenth, or possibly less, of what they will pay out of their own pockets in order to get health insurance. I think a lot of people&mdash;and I think this is a fairly accurate observation&mdash;if they are earning less than $35,000, would think twice about spending another $900 to get private health insurance even with the incentive, particularly in light of statements that have been made in the media about the lack of value in private health insurance at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the same token, families earning less than $70,000 are going to seriously consider, even with the additional allowance of $3,000 for each child, whether an incentive of up to $450 for couples with children makes taking out private health insurance worth while when private health insurance may well cost them between $1,300 and $1,800 per year. As maybe one of those rather silly people who do have private health insurance, I can assure the Senate that, when you see a lot of money go out of your wages every month, the small proportion that you may get refunded as a result of this bill really does not make a huge amount of difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conclusion that can be drawn is that these incentives will not encourage a lot of people earning low incomes to take out private health insurance or to alter their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> original decision to leave private health insurance. It is not a bad thing that these incentives are being provided, but it is sad that they will not bring about the result hoped for: that they will not decline the state of the private health insurance industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Late last week the Productivity Commission brought down a paper in relation to the private health insurance industry. It is rather interesting reading but, as we are aware, it is only a discussion paper. Even though the department of health put a number of proposals in their submission to the Productivity Commission, as we were informed at an estimates hearing last week, these could not be seen as the views of the government or the minister and that any suggestion made by the health department was only of an exploratory nature. In fact, they did not see that they would be proceeding along those lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can see and understand the caution being exercised by this government. One of the major views being put forward by the department of health is that there should be a change to something that has been generally considered quite sacred: the community rating system. It is a fairly complicated name but, really, it is a fairly simple issue. Under community rating, the cost of private health insurance is spread across the community generally so that those who are a higher risk&mdash;the elderly, the frail, pregnant women perhaps&mdash;do not have to pay greater premiums for their health insurance than those who are maybe a lesser risk&mdash;the young, the healthy and the athletic in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite this government stating very clearly during the last election that they would not change that proposition, this issue now appears to be open for discussion as the department of health raised it with the Productivity Commission and it is being commented on by them. The department of health are proposing that we should look at changes to the way premiums are determined and possibly introduce a system of what they call life community rating. In my view, the term `life community rating' is really a misnomer because apparently including the words `community rating' somehow makes life community rating the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1049"> same as, similar to or only a slight variation of community rating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is entirely untrue. There will be a fundamental change if life community rating is introduced in that the date that people take out life insurance will determine the premium they will pay. For example, if a 21-year-old joins, they will pay a lower premium if they continue with that life insurance company. If a person joins when they are 65, they will pay a much higher premium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose if we looked at this in absolute basic terms we could say the premium we would be paying would not be related to risk, but in fact it would be. There is very much a direct connection between the age at which someone takes out health insurance and how likely they are to get sick. In fact, the younger people are when they join, the lower the risk is of their becoming ill and costing their private health insurance company a lot of money. As time passes people get older and at the same time their risk of becoming ill and the risk of costing their insurer a large amount of money go up. I just wanted to take this opportunity to very much put forward my view that the introduction of a life community rating is very much contrary to the original community rating and to the original promises made by this government about retaining community rating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go back to the original problem which this legislation is attempting to deal with: the declining membership of private health insurance and where the industry is headed. Certainly that is a major difficulty. The sums have been done by those people who fiddle with numbers, and apparently every one per cent of people who drop their private health insurance cost the community, as I recall, $300 million. At the moment participation in private health insurance is declining quite rapidly, relatively unchecked. There is a major concern in the community, and with this legislation the government has attempted to deal with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in fact attempted to deal with the problem in an entirely different way, and that was through legislation introduced late in our government which allowed for contracting between private health insurers and, firstly, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hospitals that provide a service to patients and, secondly, doctors. Though there has been quite some success and quite a large number of contracts concluded between hospitals and private health insurers, the major area where there has been no success&mdash;largely as a result of coordination provided by the AMA&mdash;has been in the complete failure for any contracts to be reached between the doctors and the insurers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Senate Community Affairs Committee took evidence, I think there was an indication that fewer than half a dozen doctors had entered into contracts. The difficulty this has created is that, even though there has been the commencement of containment of costs in relation to hospitals, there has been absolutely no containment in the cost that patients expend outside of what they receive from their insurer when they use a doctor to treat them. That means, of course, that every time a privately insured patient goes into hospital they still have no idea what they may have to pay when they come out, not to the hospital&mdash;as I have said, there are many contracts in place&mdash;but to the doctor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of people feel that, if you are paying maybe up to $1,800 a year for private health insurance, the whole point of that is to reduce your risk. If you become ill and go into hospital, you have covered yourself; you have transferred to the private health insurer your risk of becoming ill. But, as the scheme presently functions, even though you have paid up to $1,800 or so a year for your private health insurance, when you go in and are treated by a doctor, you may well find that you still have to pay a substantial amount of money out of your pocket to your doctor. I think that is why a lot of people in the community feel that private health insurance just is not worth it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has sought to deal with what has occurred with the higher income earners in a slightly different fashion. For those higher income earners it is not only a carrot approach, with their incentives, but also a stick approach in that if a higher income earner does not take out private health insurance they will be charged an additional Medicare levy. As you can see, this can 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1050"> appear on the face of it to be quite attractive and a lot of people would say, `For those who have an ability to pay, why shouldn't it be that they pay a little more? Why shouldn't they be providing a little bit more towards our health system?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is where the rub is; isn't it? The way this legislation is framed, any additional Medicare levy that is paid does not necessarily go towards our health system. In fact all it does is go into consolidated revenue. While the high income earners are paying additional funds, the amount of money as a total going into our health system is declining, as I stated previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think if you explained that to the community&mdash;that, yes, certain people are going to be paying more if they do not take out private health insurance, but in fact the health system will not be any better funded, the amount of money being provided to the states is declining and the amount of money going to the states for health funding is declining&mdash;they would be a little shocked and horrified to hear that that is the case. I think they would see there was not really a huge point in collecting this extra levy when it does not result, firstly, in an improvement to our health funding and, secondly, in an increase in the number of people taking out private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, this package of bills does not solve the problem. It does not increase the number of people taking out private health insurance, it does not improve the level of funding provided to our health system and it will not give the community a better health system overall. As such, we register our complete disappointment at the approach that this government has taken. In respect of the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill, I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the years the Australian Democrats have made no secret of their dissatisfaction with tax breaks, or indeed subsidies of any sort for private health insurance. We went into the last federal election with an election health platform called `Five better ways to spend half a billion dollars on health'. That was developed in direct response to the coalition's election promise of tax rebates for private health insurance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We simply suggested a better way of spending some $500 million&mdash;a far better way than subsidising the private health insurance industry. We suggested that the five underfunded priority areas where the money could be better spent were public hospitals, public dental services, indigenous health, rural health services and mental health services. What we have actually seen in the last budget are cuts to or, in the case of the dental service, a wipe&hyphen;out of these services. Presumably these cuts and the removal of the dental health scheme were in order to pay for the measure that we are here debating today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe that that is an unacceptable trade&hyphen;off. We remain convinced that spending half a billion dollars on these critical areas would be a much better way to spend the money than putting it into private health incentives, such as this package does.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1051">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one denies that the decline in private health insurance membership is having an impact on the public sector, and, in particular, on our public hospitals. There is considerable dispute about the extent of that impact. The various excuses the states are giving for taking even more money out of the public hospital system are only worsening what we are seeing in that area. Some claims of the actual extent of the impact, I think, are exaggerated. Nevertheless, there certainly is an impact, and that is being felt by the states and, more especially, by the patients, who are now either waiting longer times for services in our public health system or are no longer able to access those services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some instances this is because of additional costs. Also, questions are beginning to be asked about a range of practices, including early discharge in some public hospitals. But that does not mean that throwing half a billion dollars a year at the private health insurance industry is going to fix those problems. Surely it is far better to fix them directly. In fact, in terms of addressing the problems facing Australia's public hospital system, these incentives are likely to be, as Jeff Kennett put it last week, `money down the drain'. It is rare that I agree with Mr Kennett, but on this one I think he has got it right. It is hard to find anyone outside the federal government and, of course, the private health insurance funds themselves and their spokespersons, who think that these incentives are sound from either an economic or a health perspective. I point you there to recent statements by the AMA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that talks a lot about the budget bottom line and about being fiscally responsible. This is a government which abolished a dental health program for low income earners, and pulled hundreds of millions of dollars out of the public health system. Yet here it is, putting up an astronomically expensive package which, compared with the other options available to it, simply is not going to deliver a better health care system to Australians. For a start, these rebates are simply not going to be high enough to encourage a significant number of people to take up private health insurance. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They may not even be high enough to encourage people to stay in private health insurance. A rebate of $450 a year for a family, for example, is not necessarily sufficient incentive for that family to take out insurance when they are faced with a premium of maybe $1,700 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot see the take&hyphen;up being anywhere near as high as many pundits are suggesting. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) is himself hoping for two per cent over the next three years; I think the Industry Commission is predicting around five per cent. Others are reading the minister's comments in the lower house as around six per cent. But even a five per cent take&hyphen;up is highly unlikely, as the Industry Commission pointed out in its draft report, `to cost effectively relieve pressure on the public system'. The reasons for this are, the commission said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People who take up private insurance as a result of the incentives are more likely to be lesser users of the public system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Privately insured people may still make use of the public system&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">as they are deciding to do now&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">public patients</EMPHASIS>  . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, they do not declare their insurance status, particularly if they go in in an emergency or for a major operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rebates for ancillaries will have very little impact on the public system as most ancillaries are not available under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In short, the overall budgetary impact of the rebate will inevitably be negative, because the savings to Medicare are going to fall a long way short of the cost of the rebate. The savings we are looking at may be as little as $20 million a year&mdash;the commission would not go as far as to put a figure on it. So, for $600 million, you save maybe $20 or $30 million. Very strange accounting indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further and significant problem with these incentives is that they do absolutely nothing to address those structural issues which are the cause of rising premiums and out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket expenses. We have already seen significant increases in premiums since these incentives were actually announced. You would have though that it would have been in the interests of the funds to try to hold off 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1052"> increases until at least this incentive measure was in place and until people had had an opportunity to feel its impact; but no, we have had substantial increases. Indeed, if you look at these increases, we are seeing a rise in private health insurance of roughly 3&half; times CPI inflation since 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do these incentives do to halt that rise? The answer is: absolutely nothing. In fact, it is not unfair to assume that the likely result of pumping such a massive amount of money into private health insurance will be that the private sector will further increase premiums and that other costs will go up; the demand will increase for those at the demand end of the system. The obvious question is: why should Australian taxpayers subsidise this industry when they get no or very little control over fees, prices and costs within the industry in return for that investment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have to question the notion that private health insurance is a necessary item. It is not. It is an optional extra which people choose to purchase over and above their Medicare contribution and entitlement. It is a product which, fairly obviously, many Australians are choosing not to buy. As such, it is difficult to see why, other than on ideological grounds, the majority of Australian taxpayers are now being asked&mdash;that is, the majority who have decided to opt out of this product or who decided not to buy it in the first place&mdash;to subsidise those people who have decided to buy it. Surely, if the government can find $600 million a year to spend on health, it is fairer all round if the money goes towards the system which the majority of Australians are using&mdash;the public system. I note here&mdash;I will explain further at the end&mdash;that I intend to move one small amendment to the Labor Party's two second reading attachments to make sure that we are not just talking about this money going to public hospitals, but also into the public health services. In particular, I wish to re&hyphen;target dental health and mental health services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will say again that the Democrats make no apologies for supporting public funding for health care. It is the fairest, most efficient and most effective way of delivering health services to all Australians&mdash;delivering services 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not on the ability to pay but on the basis of need. We have always said that we believe that ideally Medicare should simply cover everyone for their choice of doctor in a private or public hospital bed, with private insurance restricted to ancillaries or luxuries. We believe this is a sensible, fiscally responsible and healthy solution but, given that such an approach is unlikely to be accepted in the short to medium term, we can only argue for a much stronger commitment from government, particularly this government, towards the public system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to look at the Medicare levy surcharge. For several years now the Democrats have called for higher income earners to pay a higher Medicare levy by making it more progressive. We have also, I might add, called for the levy to more accurately reflect the actual expenditure on health&mdash;in other words, decrease general taxation and lift the levy until you balance it out so people can actually see what it is we are putting into our health system. I understand the objection to this approach&mdash;that the whole idea of making it progressive, some have argued, turns it into a one or maybe two or three tiered system. I believe when you have a health system that is so clearly crying out for additional resources it is appropriate that progressively higher income earners are asked to pay a greater share of the burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with the government's approach is threefold. Firstly, it effectively penalises people for not buying something. The obvious question is: why should any Australian be penalised by the government for refusing to purchase something that they do not want? If the government wants high income earners to pay more for their health care, then they should simply increase the Medicare levy. Do not link it to a failure to do anything else&mdash;in this case a failure to buy health insurance. Increase the levy and put it directly into the public system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the surcharge is basically an additional tax on the use of the public system by a group of people who already contribute to that system more than the average taxpayer. Just look at the levy. The higher income you earn the more you pay into a system and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1053"> now those people are being penalised if they do not pay even more. Finally, it may not be a sufficiently high penalty, given the high price of premiums, to encourage high income earners, particularly those with an ideological commitment to Medicare, to take out private health insurance. I think we are only looking at about 17 or 18 per cent of people in those high income brackets who do not already have private health insurance. I would argue that many of them do not have it because they have a commitment to Medicare. These people may simply prefer to cop the additional levy rather than paying out even more to take out private health cover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats will be proposing amendments to this legislation to break the link with private health insurance whilst still requiring higher income earners to make that higher contribution. Our proposal would raise an additional $350 million a year, some $300 million more than the government's proposal&mdash;money which could and should be directed into the public health system, into our hospitals, into our community health services and into mental health services in particular for young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the strain on our community health services, with the changes to hospital funding, particularly in my home state, the pressure of early discharge is placing a burden on our community health services that they simply cannot now meet. Looking at mental health services, I recently spent some time in Whyalla. For young people at least there are now mental health services, which is a start. But young people in that area who have already been assessed as in critical need of mental health services&mdash;many of these young people have attempted suicide; they have major behavioural problems&mdash;have to wait 14 months to access that mental health service. There are many places where the money that has been poured into private health insurance should be going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the rebate, we will be moving an amendment which sets up a sunset clause on the legislation. Unless an increase of at least three per cent take&hyphen;up in private health insurance is achieved over the next three years&mdash;in other words, unless this actually 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> does what the government says it is going to do&mdash;then this will lapse. If the government really believes a rebate will put a floor under the drop&hyphen;out rate and is prepared, as it seems to be, to back that assertion with $1.7 billion worth of taxpayers' money over the next three years, then surely it will be prepared to back its judgment by letting this legislation collapse if that does not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, on one of the other bills in this package, we will again be voting against the proposal to increase the medical expenses rebate threshold. As none of these so-called incentives are directed at those who self&hyphen;insure, it should be up to us to make the decision to self&hyphen;insure. We should not be forced into private health insurance. Therefore, it is surely more important than ever for this government to encourage people to be prepared to self&hyphen;insure; in other words, for people to make a conscious decision that even though they do not have private health insurance they will not burden the public system. They will take themselves off to the private system perhaps for day surgery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To see this back in here is most disappointing at a time when the government is supposedly concerned about the pressure on the public system by people who are using it who should have private insurance&mdash;or maybe who do have it. Here in this very package is something that is working in the other direction. In this package is a measure that is saying, `No, we are not going to encourage you to look after yourself.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a great deal of sadness that I rise today to speak on these four Medicare and health related bills. It is with sadness because this is the first act of emasculation of the health care system as we know it in this country. The government is finally beginning to implement Son of Fightback. This is a great tragedy for those in this country who have health care needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government made much during the election campaign about how wonderful this incentive package would be&mdash;people would be able to take out private health insurance&mdash;and how they were going to encourage the low income earners to take out private health insurance. That is one of the nastiest things that have been perpetrated on the lower income people in this country that I can think of, because what private health insurance buys you is bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whom have we heard that from in recent times? None other than the Australian Medical Association. They even went as far last week as to urge people to drop their private health insurance. I will not suggest that they might have some personal reasons of their own for that; maybe it is because they do not want the private health insurance company insurers monitoring and lobbying against some of the charging tactics of some of the members of the AMA as well, because they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are pretty rampant in disregarding the needs of people with some of their pricing policies too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at these private health insurance incentives. The amounts of money that are being offered to people to take out private health insurance go nowhere towards the purchasing of private health insurance. I think it would cover about a quarter&mdash;maybe less&mdash;of the amount of money that people would have to pay to take out private health insurance. Whilst you are giving people incentives to take out private health insurance, to do so they are having to expend two or three times more than what they are going to get back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in the other place quoted Mr Kennett, the Victorian Premier, as saying late last week that this was a good idea. It is a pity that Mr Howard, in his usual form, was not living in the future&mdash;as usual, he was living in the past&mdash;because about Thursday of last week, Mr Kennett described the rebates as` money down the drain' and `good money after bad'. Even Mr Kennett is able to see through his Liberal colleagues' shenanigans. Even Mr Kennett is prepared to stand up and say, `This is not a good piece of legislation. This is about wasting taxpayers' money because the amount of money that it is going to cost the government to implement this scheme is more than what they will actually reduce their expenditure by.' It is actually going to cost money to save money. They will save less money than they are actually going to spend to save it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That sounds to me like more black hole stuff. They are getting pretty good at this black hole. They have been in 12 months and they have managed to black hole something like $4&half; billion or $5 billion. That is not bad going. That is a pretty good annual rate. By the end of three years, they will be up to $15 billion, if not more. Pretty shocking!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen a fast one pulled because this government when in opposition for 13 years had more health policies than some people have had hot dinners. It has even cost shadow ministers their positions and things like that. After they had been in for a while, they thought they knew so little about it that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1055"> they had better have an inquiry, so they set up the Productivity Commission inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about that one? We had the draft report. We were told that there was going to be a report out last Friday. There is every indication that the report has gone to the government. Is it not funny that the government, while we are busy discussing this legislation, while we are debating this critical and crucial legislation about the direction of health in this country, chooses to pass this legislation prior to the public release&mdash;</PARA>

They are expecting us to make decisions in an uninformed manner, which raises two points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a legal situation, we are being asked to enter into an agreement when we are not fully informed of all of the facts. Out in the real world, if this were any other thing such as a contract, that would render that particular agreement null and void because it was made without cognisance and understanding of the full facts. But that does not bother this mob. One has to wonder why they have not released it. I will wager they have not released it because it shows that what they are trying to do is not going to address the needs of the community and certainly is not going to address the needs of the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is sloppy and slapdash work by this particular government. They obviously do not have any understanding&mdash;neither do they care; they are just ideologically driven. They will drive this through, come hell or high water. Too bad what we on this side of the parliament might say. They will just ride over us while taking no cognisance of our amendments. Too bad even what the inquiry they have set up might say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know; maybe the inquiry agrees with everything they are doing. But I would have thought, if that were the case, we would have seen its results being published very quickly. They would have been in here trumpeting those results. They would have

As I say, if everything in that commission report had vindicated their position, their stance, their legislation&mdash;or even half done so&mdash;what would they have been doing?

I rest my case on that particular issue because I know these gentlemen and ladies opposite. If they believed that their position had been vindicated by that report, politically it would be naive for them to sit there and say nothing about it. Politically, obviously it is a bit smelly and does not agree with them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at some of the other things they have done in health. First of all, their coalition policy <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Healthy Future</EMPHASIS> contained the following promise:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The incentives will not be funded from the public hospital system or health grants to the States. Other than the $50 million which will be reallocated from the Better Practice Program, the incentive will be funded entirely from savings outside the Health and Human Services Portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Go and have a look at what has happened to health in the last 12 months: grants to the states have been slashed by $1.5 billion over three years, which is a cut of about $500 million in state health funding each year, representing approximately one&hyphen;third of health 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1056"> expenditure; they have made direct funding cuts to public hospitals of more than $300 million over four years; and there have been other massive cuts to health policy totalling more than $3 billion over four years. All this has been for a promise that incentives will not be funded out of the public hospitals system. What they have done? They have taken a machete&mdash;you cannot even say a razor blade, as that is too polite&mdash;to the health system and the health budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see headlines in the local papers of all of the states about problems in the health system&mdash;and everybody keeps blaming the states. I will tell you who is to blame for the problems in the health system: this federal government, because they have taken a machete to everything. This Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has tried to defend a lot of these cuts to the public hospital funds on the basis that they are an attack on cost shifting. Why is it then that the state that suffers the biggest cut in funding is New South Wales? Also, why is it that, at estimates when we asked this question, the state that was into cost shifting in the biggest way was Victoria, although it did not suffer the biggest cuts? The government is looking after its mates as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an appalling situation&mdash;just appalling. It ignores a lot of things. It ignores the fact that costs were shifted the other way. It ignores the fact that hospitals have been forced by conservative state governments to accept further cutbacks and to shift costs&mdash;and they have done so to protect staff and keep beds open. Further cutting to funding will only make things worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know of anybody in this country, particularly any doctor&mdash;with the exception of Dr Wooldridge&mdash;who thinks public hospitals get too much money. Nobody thinks that. The government also have made cuts to programs that were going to reduce waiting lists in public hospitals. Also, they have made cuts to programs that cover things like palliative care. But they do not seem to care about these things; they do not bother them&mdash;not at all. And what are we seeing?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1X4">Senator WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Cuts to pharmaceutical benefits, as my colleague says. What about the dental health program? Really and truly, this government puts itself up as a caring government. It wants people to feel comfortable. I do not know where people who are sick are going to feel comfortable. If they are to feel comfortable, it certainly will not be with any thanks to this government&mdash;and particularly if people do not have significant amounts of private health insurance and significant income levels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts to public hospitals alone equate to the closing of a thousand beds or turning away 66,000 people waiting for operations. This is a government, as I said, that just does not care about people. It is ideologically driven. It does not mind having two&hyphen;tier systems, and I will get on to that in a minute. The government is ideologically driven and it just wants to make cuts. As I say, this will do absolutely nothing at all to assist those people who are low income earners to have private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We notice that the values of the rebates and benefits, since being announced by this government in the budget, are being eroded because all the health funds are putting up their premiums. The Prime Minister got very worried about that; he actually intervened. He now personally has to approve every health fund increase. Not too many have been refused, I might add.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government even used the visit of the President of the United States to hide a couple of approvals for increases. Medibank Private and MBF managed to get some pretty large cuts through that week. Recently MBF has been closing branches in rural New South Wales. All I can say is that that is not much good for the provision of private health insurance out there. It is a problem. The government is not addressing it correctly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Taxation Laws Amendment (Private Health Insurance Incentives) Bill. Again, here goes another broken promise. We do not know whether or not it was a core promise, but it was a broken promise on the part of the government. They promised that there would be no new taxes or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1057"> no increase in taxes. Those of you who have been around for a while well recall the questioning of Senator Short when he was the minister and now Senator Kemp as the minister representing the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) to try to get them to define what is a tax, what is not a tax, what is a levy and why a levy is not a tax. I do not know why a levy is not a tax. All I know is that if there is a levy on something, you and I and everybody else still have to dig into the hip pocket to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the second increase in the Medicare levy. We have no objections to one increase. We support the gun buyback program that this has been used for. It is a real worry. This proposal is a masquerade, a facade and a mirage. It is designed to impose a one per cent Medicare surcharge on individuals with taxable incomes greater than $50,000 or families with combined taxable incomes greater than $100,000 who do not have private patient hospital cover for themselves and all family members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time we have actually seen the government attacking Defence Force families, because they have refused to exempt Defence Force personnel. You could well have a situation where Defence Force families will be having to pay, when they should have been exempted because the personnel themselves have health cover in their job. If a single person has an income over $50,000, they are up for the levy. A couple with a combined taxable income of over $100,000 are up for it as well. But the government could not care less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, this is a mirage. We can look at the number of people who will be affected. Figures from the department show that about 110,000 singles and 100,000 couples and families will be affected. Less than one quarter of a million of the population of this country will be affected by this proposal. Most of this group have private health insurance. If they do not, they have made a deliberate choice not to have private health insurance and to privately cover their own costs. So it is a real mirage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other crazy thing is that it will be possible to get around this and save yourself 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some money by taking out the minimum amount of private health insurance that has some hospital cover in it. That will cost you less than the one per cent surcharge. It will do absolutely nothing to increase people's access to hospitals and things like that. This levy is just the thin edge of the wedge. By refusing to index the threshold, more and more people will go into this category and will be forced to pay the penalty levy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a great deal of concern about this because I think this is the first step towards a two&hyphen;tiered health system&mdash;one for the rich and one for the poor. We have already seen that this government is not averse to two&hyphen;tiered systems. We have seen it this year with the introduction of being able to buy your way into university and being able to buy your way into higher education if you have the wherewithal and the means. Those who do not have the financial means will be penalised. We are also seeing it with nursing homes. They are heading towards creating a two&hyphen;tiered system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, these are four pieces of legislation that we should not be debating here today. We should be waiting until we see the results of the report that the government commissioned. Why will you not table this report so we can debate this issue in the full knowledge of what the advice to you people has been? You are too scared because your legislation is crook.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak today in support of my colleagues. What seems to have escaped the notice of the coalition parties is that the public strongly supports Medicare. I supported it and I know the people of Tasmania did. They were under the impression that the Liberal Party did too. I was mistakenly under the impression that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) had come to the realisation that the public was strongly committed to Medicare and wanted to see a viable, strong public hospital system. This is obviously not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is an attempt to encourage people to retain or obtain private health insurance. As the shadow minister for health 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1058"> articulated in the other place on 24 February, we will not be blocking this legislation, because we do not want to stop contributors receiving the payments that were announced prior to the election. I have to say, however, that Australians have been sold out with this policy. They believed that they were going to get some support for their private health insurance as a result of the subsidy. Of course, we already know that this is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take the opportunity to point out that the legislation is fundamentally flawed in concept and will not achieve its objectives in halting the drift away from private health insurance. This change began with the advent of Medicare in 1984. Since then, more and more people have voted with their feet in favour of Medicare. The government likes to put this fact in a negative light. I, and the Labor Party, are proud to say that we are pleased that the people see Medicare in a positive way and that they support Medicare, understand what lies behind Medicare and want the public hospital system strengthened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government still does not understand, even though on the surface it has said it supports Medicare, that Medicare is supposed to offer universal health insurance. People are supposed to feel comfortable with universal health insurance. They are not supposed to feel guilty that they rely on the public system. That is what Medicare offers them and that is what the government offered before the election&mdash;that it would strongly support Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition parties have clearly misunderstood the contract that was entered into with the Australian people when Medicare was introduced. Medicare was designed to be a universal system that everybody would share in, regardless of their wealth. It was deliberately designed for that purpose. It was deliberately designed to reduce the number of people with private health insurance, many of whom could not afford that private health insurance, many of whom had no cover because of the system that existed at that time.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we got into government in 1983, the health system, by everyone's assessment in this country, was a shambles. It was a shambles that, sadly, we look set to return to. Under the Fraser and Howard governments, conservatives lurched through five chaotic health systems in seven years with five changes as they progressively dismantled Whitlam's Medibank. It would seem that the Howard government would like to return to those times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that lots of people who voted Liberal in the last election, maybe for the first time in their lives, were worried about what might happen to health care under a Liberal government. That commitment from John Howard might have pushed them to the limit and helped convince them that the Liberal Party could be taken on trust with the commitments they made to keep Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most likely effect of this legislation, of course, is going to be the underpinning of rises in the premiums for private health insurance, and we have already seen significant evidence of this. Some funds have already raised their prices in anticipation of the introduction of subsidies. So individual consumers are not going to be better off and taxpayers will have to pay the additional costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These latest price rises are part of an established pattern which has seen private health insurance premiums rise by 3&half; times the CPI rate of inflation since 1990. The effect of rising premiums has, not surprisingly, in turn, caused lower risk members to drop out of health funds at a greater rate than do the higher risk members, resulting in higher costs for insurance companies and further premium rises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission pointed out just before Christmas that, even without increased premiums, the savings to Medicare will fall considerably short of the costs of the rebate. That is yet more evidence of the conceptual problems of this policy. These measures do absolutely nothing to address one of the major causes of the decline in private health insurance, which is the high out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket costs for medical treatment provided in hospitals to privately insured individuals. Due to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1059"> complexity of the existing private health arrangements and entitlements, many consumers are unsure about the benefits of their insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of these concerns are addressed in this legislation. Nor does the legislation do anything to reduce the cost of health care in the private sector, which in turn is driving the costs of private health insurance. It is also likely that any impact of the subsidy will be to assist people who are already privately insured rather than to encourage into private insurance those who now rely on Medicare. Of course, this has been the government's primary objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to think about that for a moment&mdash;the length of time that Australian families will think about this policy. A family is not going to pay $2,000 per annum to get a small subsidy of $450 per annum. They would rather know that, if they needed to go into a public hospital, they could do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Liberal Party members to suggest that a single pensioner will magically find $800 to take out private health insurance simple to get the benefit of a $125 incentive is ridiculous. It is the same sort of logic that has the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, claiming that pensioners who are being forced to pay an extra 50c for every script will not suffer hardship. I have had a lot of people in my electorate office who have grave concerns about what seems to Dr Wooldridge a small amount of money. To those people, it is not a small amount of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Various estimates have been given of the likely increase in private health coverage as a result of the subsidies provided in this legislation. They range from the department's estimate of two per cent for $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money to the Industry Commission's estimate of five per cent. This is hardly a major achievement, particularly in view of the substantial cost of $1.7 billion. This is a huge sum and it is far greater than the amount the government estimates will be obtained through the Medicare surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This contrasts starkly with the government's slash and burn approach to health and community services generally, introduced in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> last budget. There is no doubt that this money could have been used more effectively to directly assist people who need operations in public hospitals, if it had been directed straight to the public hospitals. We know that the $1.7 billion comes from this government's slashing of public hospital funding by $800 million, destroying the Commonwealth dental program&mdash;and again in my home state of Tasmania quite drastically&mdash;and increasing the cost of essential medicine. All of this is going to a few people to basically protect them against further increases in health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An additional outcome of this legislation will be cost shifting. In some cases hospitals have had to cost shift onto the Commonwealth just to keep their waiting lists under control, to try to make sure that people who are on those waiting lists are not in pain. Dr Wooldridge comes in and declares that cost shifting is taking place, instead of giving more money to the public hospitals to fix the problem. Dr Wooldridge must be the only doctor in Australia who thinks he has solved the problem by giving less money to the public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you are going to see with this legislation is the first of many steps from this government that will undermine Medicare. This is the first step that undermines the universality of Medicare. Once the principle is openly accepted that Medicare is only intended to serve a section of the community, not all Australians, it will be easy to define that group more and more narrowly so that in the end Medicare becomes a residual program for those who cannot afford private health coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most people will remember what it was like to line up at outpatient clinics before Medicare and before Medibank. What you had to do was prove that you were poor enough to get into the public system. We do not support any move back to that system. We do not think there should be the need to prove you are poor just to get the charity of the taxpayer. That is not what Medicare is about. Medicare, as we already have said, is about making sure that when it comes to health care we are treated as equals.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1060">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government would see our private health system strengthened at the expense of the public system. It attacks our public system because of its cost. It is a fallacy to assume that private health care is cheaper than public health care. In fact, this coalition government has demonstrated its lack of commitment to elderly people in the Australian community who will now have to pay money. People on very low incomes will now have to pay money for a service that they have previously received free of charge. In many cases, it will not be a matter of how much people can afford to pay. They will not be able to get into programs run by the state governments, so they will have to wait, in some cases for years, before they get treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at a couple of figures. In 1995, health services expenditure in Australia, with a predominantly public system, was 8.4 per cent of GDP. In Britain, with an even larger public system, it was 6.9 per cent. In the United States, with a predominantly private system, it was 14.5 per cent. If anything is going to send this country broke, it will be its private health insurance, and its private health insurance and health care costs are the single greatest cause of bankruptcy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before Medicare was introduced in 1984, we had almost two million Australians with no health care coverage at all and many others who were uninsured. It is incumbent on all in this chamber to make sure there is no move in this parliament that encourages a recurrence of that disgraceful situation. Were that to happen, the Australian community would not forgive nor forget. It would certainly not forget the government that went to them saying they supported Medicare but on the anniversary of their first year in office began to destroy Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian community values Medicare highly; indeed, it is one of the most highly valued Commonwealth programs. Medicare has its problems but this legislation does not address them. We need to fight to maintain Medicare. We need to fight to ensure that the public hospital system is strong enough to cope with the demands upon it. Spending $1.7 billion on private health subsidies and ensuring that wealthy people have an incentive to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> leave the system signifies the last nail in the coffin of Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We certainly think that, in hindsight, the government should come clean and admit that it would have been better for us to have spent this money directly on helping people who were sick, in making sure many operations were performed, in making sure that operating theatres were operating longer and making sure that all Australians got a benefit from the expenditure of this $1.7 billion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has never been opposed to the existence of a dual system of universal health cover through Medicare on the one hand and a complementary system of private health insurance on the other. What we are vehemently opposed to are measures which, on the one hand, seek to undermine, to slash funding to the public health care system in this country and, at the same time, provide dubious benefits in terms of health care to the private health system. That is what we are getting from this government. The policy document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Healthy Future</EMPHASIS>, speaking about the incentives for taking out private health insurance, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The incentive will not be funded from the public hospital system or health grants to the States. Other than $50 million which will be reallocated from the Better Practice Program, the incentive will be funded entirely from savings outside the Health and Human Services portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, that core promise was abandoned by this government very shortly after. Indeed, what a misnomer to call their policy <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Healthy Future</EMPHASIS> . No Australian today feels comfortable and relaxed about this government's approach to health policy. If ever there is a time when you would wish to feel comfortable and relaxed, it is at a time when you are ill and you are in hospital. This is a time when you do not want to have to worry too much, if at all, about how you are going to pay for these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In August last year, within five months of the election, this government brought down a budget which slashed some $1.5 billion in financial grants to the states over three years. That represented a reduction of around $500 million to the states with respect to health funding. Ultimately, it is the states that are responsible for the delivery of the public health system to Australians. That is a massive cut in the funding to the states for health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, we know that there have been other cuts. The dental health program has been 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> abolished. There have been changes to benefits and assistance for people suffering from psychiatric illnesses as well as direct cuts to the public hospital systems in the states. In total, there will be a reduction in health care funding of around $3 billion or more over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet this government promised that it would maintain Medicare and further fund its private health insurance initiatives out of other areas, other than cuts to overall health care funding. That is a shameful broken promise on one of the most important, if not the most important, areas of community concern for ordinary Australians. My colleague Senator Denman has quite adequately covered the dangers in this legislation and the overall approach adopted by this government with respect to health funding and the continuation of Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people did vote for this government, for a change of government after 13 years of the Labor government, but they voted for this government in the belief that it would continue with Medicare. I do not think they are feeling terribly comfortable and relaxed about what is in store for them in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now deal very quickly with some of the key features of this legislation that this government is putting before the parliament. The key feature of this whole package is the proposal to provide a rebate to individuals and families who take out private health insurance. A family that takes out health insurance, with both hospital cover and medical cover, may receive a rebate of up to $450 per annum; couples may receive a rebate of up to $250 per annum; and individuals may receive a rebate of up to $125 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been well documented and commented on, but I need to remind senators again, that this proposal just does not make financial sense in terms of changing the minds of people who at the moment do not believe it is in their financial or health care interests to take out private health insurance. As has been asked: why would a family or an individual elect to spend up to $2,000 per year on health care insurance in order to get back through the system a rebate of $450? If they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1062"> are in the position, as many Australians and increasingly many more Australians are, of not having private health insurance, they are in that position because they frankly do not believe that private health insurance is good value, and I have to agree with them. It is not good financial sense for many people to make a decision to spend $2,000 if they are only going to get back $450 when at the present time they are not spending any money at all on private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was listening to a talkback radio program the other day on which this issue was being discussed. A woman rang in and said that her family had had private health insurance for some years. They had been paying somewhere between $1,500 and $2,000 per year&mdash;a fairly healthy family. When she finally came to make a claim for a refund on a dental procedure, something available under private health insurance coverage but not covered by the public health system, she got back in the vicinity of $75 for a procedure which cost $500. She asked the question, quite obviously, `What was the value? I have been paying all this money for all these years and when it finally came time to make a claim on a dental procedure, all I got back was $75 out of $500.' That is the situation that faces many Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen, of course, is the position where health costs, particularly for surgery, whether it be medical or dental, are set at levels by the professions way in excess of what the funds will refund to individuals taking out insurance. Furthermore, the funds place limits upon the number of claims that may be made in areas such as physiotherapy, dental or other procedures which are generally covered under optional or extra health insurance coverage and which are clearly not Medicare related procedures. I know from my own experience&mdash;we all know from people telling us&mdash;that when you go to hospital, you come out after an operation with a bill for, say, $2,500 and you get back a total of, say, $800 based upon the schedule fee. There is no real value in having insurance in situations like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People are increasingly electing to have their own bank accounts specifically ear 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> marked to cover health costs as they may arise in the future and rely upon the public health system, particularly for emergency treatment. Of course, whilst that is happening, what we see this government doing is providing this very dubious benefit to people who may already have private health insurance or&mdash;this is most unlikely&mdash;those who may elect to take out health cover, and at the same time slashing hundreds of millions of dollars out of the public health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I wish to make is in relation to the surcharge. If ever we have seen a con trick this is it; this is the Costello con. Here we have a proposal which, firstly, is a breach of another promise. It is the imposition of a tax, albeit there may not be that many people who actually have to pay it in the end. But it certainly is the imposition of a new tax; that is, a tax on families who have an income of over $100,000 and who do not currently have private health insurance, and a tax on individuals with an income of over $50,000 who do not have private health insurance. They are going to be taxed a surcharge of one per cent on their income. This surcharge is supposedly designed to encourage those people to take out private health insurance. It is also designed apparently to try to recoup some revenue towards the health budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know from the Treasury's estimates that this measure is going to have very little, if any, impact in turning around the decline in private health insurance coverage in this country. It will not have much impact at all, the main reason being that many people in those categories are the people who can afford to have private health insurance, given the current cost of such insurance, and do so. So the number of people that would get caught in this surcharge net is very limited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, this really is a spurious proposition, a tinkering at the edges, when we see the real problems being created by this government through its slashing, as I said, of expenditure and funding for the states in the area of health care. I do not believe, and I do not think the Australian people believe, notwithstanding the Prime Minister's solemn promise at the last election, that this government has a real commitment to universal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1063"> health care. It does not have a real commitment to Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government knows, however, that it cannot stand up and state publicly and clearly that it wishes to abolish or dismantle Medicare. At least they were honest about that some years ago. They learned the lesson that the Australian public would never accept that so what they are doing is, through other means, dismantling the excellent public health system we have in this country and doing nothing to make it any more attractive for people to take out private health insurance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome Senator Patterson's question on this matter. As we all know, she has long had a very keen interest in improving the efficiency of the Department of Social Security and the services that it offers to Australians in need. She is also very well aware that the teleservice system that we inherited from the previous government was in a disgraceful state. Anybody who has tried to contact the department through the teleservice network in the last couple of years will tell you that it was frustrating and time consuming. I am sure the previous minister must have had the sort of correspondence that I have received from colleagues and members of the public expressing frustration at the mess.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government set up that service with inadequate research and certainly without enough people or money to make it work effectively. In December and January we finalised about 60,000 calls a day, which is pretty terrific except when you recognise that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we were receiving about 400,000 attempted calls in a day. That is a measure of what we inherited.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only have we recognised the reality but we have set about trying to do something about the problem. On Friday last I announced that a further 500 jobs in regional Australia are to be created in the teleservice system. Effective telephone contact with Social Security for people in regional and remote areas of Australia is of course of vital importance. They cannot just trot down the street and see their local, friendly regional office. This government recognises that that service will be improved for regional Australia as a result of our initiative. Those 500 jobs come on top of the 300 that we announced in South Australia and Victoria late last year, and they form part of an overall package and strategy designed to improve telephone access to our customers while at the same time, importantly, increasing employment in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New centres are to be established in Port Macquarie and Wendouree outside Ballarat. Over 100 jobs will be created in each of those two centres. We are also significantly expanding existing teleservice centres at Gosford, Toowoomba, Townsville and Geelong, and each of these centres will have their employee numbers boosted to around 100 in each centre, meaning an increase of about 200 new jobs in those centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further purpose&hyphen;built service of 100 new jobs is currently being considered and, once again, these jobs will go to an area with high unemployment.

Firstly, we have tried to get the domestic economy into shape by reducing interest rates, and providing a climate in which interest rates can be reduced, inflation kept down and pressure kept off taxation. If you give our exporters the opportunity to compete within a competitive do 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1067"> mestic economy, then they have a chance. Secondly, we have put our effort into opening overseas markets through good diplomacy and the like, and supporting them through organisations such as Austrade and, as you have acknowledged&mdash;although perhaps not to the extent that you would like to see, Senator&mdash;through direct assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Out of that blend&mdash;and we believe we have got the blend about right&mdash;exporters have the best chance to succeed in markets, provided they have that ingredient that you have identified as essential, and that is determination. In our view a lot of Australian exporters have got that. But what has held them back in the past has been primarily that they have had to compete within a domestic economy that is uncompetitive, and secondly that they have not had adequate access to markets. So our emphasis is on those two directions rather than specifically on the one you are referring to in your question.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But I think you would find that most film makers would say that the way in which the film industry has been supported over the last 12 months, and the way in which Gonski came in and gave a very critical but constructive analysis of the film industry, demonstrates beyond doubt that the film industry is in very good hands at the present time. The last thing they would want to do is to find themselves put at risk by you lot. You only have to ask them what they thought of Michael Lee&mdash;knew nothing about the arts, not interested; could barely recite the names of a few films that he had seen recently. That is not what it is about, Madam President.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it is about is maintaining, currently $140 million worth of funding for the arts; coming up with some new innovations as Mr Gonski has recommended in relation to what he calls `flicks' to replace the 10BA system; and restructuring some of the current arrangements in relation to film culture. Overall, he endorses the many doors policy. He makes it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very clear that the industry is doing very well at the present time, that it continues to need government assistance and that ought to be in the form of direct funding rather than indirect funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, I think one can say that the Gonski report has been very well received by the industry. We are at this time having discussions with them about ways in which they would like to see it implemented. Certainly there have been some concerns about maintaining media resource centres like the Open Channel, but these are at the margin. Overwhelmingly the industry, I think, is very comforted by the fact that Gonski has been so positive in his recommendations and this government is very supportive of the industry. May it go from strength to strength.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, since the election of this government, there have been three reductions in interest rates. That has to be in the top league of changes that will introduce confidence into the business community and likely lead to better employment levels. That partly comes about through being a responsible government and having a balanced budget and low inflation. We have made the workplace arrangements more flexible with the assistance of the Democrats. Anybody who wants to look at low unemployment levels will see a very flexible labour market. We were prepared to tackle that with the assistance of the Democrats. These people never did. They left us with a straitjacket industrial relations system. We are revitalising the apprenticeships and traineeships that were left waning under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you know, Madam President, that when we came to power, the number of apprenticeships was roughly the same as it was 10 years before? When we all know that apprenticeships are one of the key ways to ensure that someone will get a job, that is a disgrace. One of the key ways to get a job, if you are not going to university, is to get an apprenticeship, and you did not provide enough of them. We are providing individually tailored labour market assistance to unemployed Australians. Twenty&hyphen;eight thousand five hundred apprentices and trainees have commenced so far this year. That is nearly double the number for the same period last year and we will substantially exceed last year's total of 36,000. That increase is directly related to this government's having the guts to cut Labor's wasteful Working Nation programs and put that money more towards apprenticeships and traineeships.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), to a question without notice asked by Senator Bolkus today, relating to comments made by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Fischer) concerning the High Court of Australia. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1078">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On 3 January this year, the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer). It was not a normal letter; it was not a run of the mill letter. It was a letter of major constitutional impact. One has only to check through the records to find that this sort of correspondence is without precedent. It is a letter that raised legitimate concerns. It raised concerns that should be of concern not just to constitutional lawyers of this country but very much to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It raised concerns that the Deputy Prime Minister had got it wrong when he complained about the time it had taken for the Wik case judgment to come down. It also raised concerns that the Deputy Prime Minister had undermined deliberately the constitutional system of this country and had undermined the High Court. It is worth placing on record some specific quotations from that letter. The Chief Justice says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to say that there was any unwarranted delay in the delivery of the Wik judgment is quite unjustified.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One has only to read the preceding page and a half of documentation to show that the Deputy Prime Minister had got it woefully wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect of the correspondence goes to the campaign&mdash;the lynch squad&mdash;that has been out to destabilise and undermine the High Court. In that respect, Chief Justice Gerard Brennan makes a number of points, which are also important and should be placed on the record. Towards the end of his letter, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will the more readily appreciate that attacks of the kind that you have made, emanating from a Deputy Prime Minister, are damaging to this Court. You will appreciate that public confidence in the constitutional institutions of Government is critical to the stability of our society.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">members of the particular branches of government do not (and certainly should not) attack the judges except on a substantive motion in the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think his last sentence is quite telling. He asks the Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;in fact he admonishes him to bear this in mind:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to consider whether the making of attacks on the performance by this court of its constitutional functions is conducive to good government, even if an attack can gain some temporary political advantage.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I say, it is an unprecedented letter from the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, a letter which reflected obviously the concern of the High Court but also reflected the concern of many Australians at the way that Tim Fischer had gone over the top. It was not just a concern at the time. The concern is being expressed even to this day, with a letter in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  by Mr Chris Pullin QC, the President of the Australian Bar Association. In his letter, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another unfortunate aspect of the recent criticism of the court has been the personal attacks made on individual judges. This is quite unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He is spot on in that respect. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the ultimate analysis, such personal attacks should be seen as an attempt by the executive to secure more power for the executive and the legislature.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Pullin is concerned about personal attacks. He is concerned that those attacks reflect a grab for power by the executive and he is concerned that the concept of separation of powers&mdash;something quite alien to, especially, Queensland conservatives&mdash;is being blurred by the attacks by the Deputy Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been the government's response to Chief Justice Brennan's letter? It has been one monumental snub. Since that date of the correspondence, 3 January, Tim Fischer has maintained and continued his attacks, on 11 January and thereafter. Queensland's Premier Borbidge has continued the attacks and they have become more shrill, more violent and more strident. He calls the High Court justices `dills'. He talks about their being increasingly held in absolute and utter contempt. That sort of language is something that does not engender confidence in our constitutional system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams), whom one would expect to give solid support to the court, is quite equivocal when he talks about the role of the High Court and the fact that the High Court should basically come back from the sort of role it is playing. They are joined by Victorian Premier Kennett.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1079">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But one person who would love to put himself on the court&mdash;he is just about everywhere else&mdash;and who has abdicated his responsibility is the Prime Minister. He should have taken action to restrain the Deputy Prime Minister. He should have taken that some time ago. If respect for the constitution and its institutions means anything, he should have acted quickly. But, instead of defending the High Court and defending the institutions, he has actually joined in the chorus. As usual, from the sidelines, he has indulged in a debate on the High Court, claiming that the High Court has only one job and that is to interpret statute law. Yet any first year law student knows that the High Court, in its recent cases, has done what the High Court has always done, and what courts in the British system have always done: to interpret and define the common law.

He has certainly criticised the judgment of the High Court, as many others would have done. You can understand where the Leader of the National Party is coming from when, under the Native Title Act, which the Wik decision should have been based on or held in consideration for, the High Court held that native title is extinguished by valid government acts that are inconsistent with the continued existence of native title rights and interests, such as the grant of leasehold in the states. It went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The needs of the broader Australian community require certainty and the enforceability of the acts potentially make invalid because of the existence of native title. It is important to provide for the validation of those acts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">No direction could have been clearer to the High Court and yet the High Court ignored what this parliament voted on. Every one of us in this parliament believed that native title was extinguished by pastoral leases and mining leases. We all voted on it. We took the word of the previous Prime Minister, the

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak on the same matter. Senator Boswell is so completely out of his depth in considering this issue that I feel rather sorry for him. I also feel sorry for a number of members of the National Party, because they are not prepared to listen rationally to what the High Court decision is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely irresponsible of Premier Rob Borbidge to claim that the High Court is out of step and to attack the High Court because, in actual fact, the High Court has simply considered the legal issues in an international context. Australia cannot live in a vacuum when it comes to consideration of native title issues. It will have a devastating impact on our national image. It will impact on our trade reputation. It will certainly impact on our reputation as a country committed to human rights if we are not prepared to accept a very simple judgment&mdash;Senator Boswell, if you were prepared to listen&mdash;that Aboriginal people and pastoral interests may coexist. Coexistence is the issue that the High Court has ruled on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Boswell said that we understood this in the native title debate. In the native title debate, we agreed to leave this issue to the court to determine; that is, whether or not native title did in fact remain on pastoral leases and if, in fact, it could coexist. We did not know; it was left to the court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What really concerns me is that a premier of a state of this country does not understand, or chooses to ignore&mdash;I am giving him the benefit of the doubt perhaps&mdash;the separation of powers. He seems to think that as an elected representative he has the right to be absolutely dismissive of the High Court. He clearly chooses, in a very irresponsible way, to attack the High Court when in actual fact 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1081"> he should be following the leadership of someone like Jeff Kennett or the Tasmanian government. They have actually sat down and talked with indigenous people. I know that Senator Herron agrees with me, because he has made sensible comments along these lines. I acknowledge that Senator Herron and indeed the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have spoken of the need to negotiate, to work this decision through in the interests of both pastoralists and indigenous peoples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyway, the rights of pastoralists prevail. In all the damaging rhetoric Premier Borbidge has been spouting for some weeks now, he seems to choose to ignore that the High Court has said absolutely clearly that where there is a dispute that cannot be resolved the interests of the pastoralists will prevail. So much of what we are hearing is mere political rhetoric, but the damaging feature of political rhetoric is that it impacts very severely on, particularly, indigenous peoples. It unnecessarily worries pastoralists, who should be being told, `We can sort this out if we all learn to live and listen together. We can resolve these issues, just as they have been resolved on Cape York.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead, the Premier of Queensland is more interested in political opportunism, in grandstanding and in attacking the High Court in an absolutely disgraceful way. He has no right to abuse the High Court. All the High Court has done has been to consider the evidence and look at the international precedents&mdash;precedents that have existed in countries like the United States, Canada and Scandinavia for much of this century.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What that committee properly looked at was the question of gender bias in the judiciary and what could be done to remedy the perception in the community that existed at that time. That related to a number of notorious cases involving sexual offences. So there is nothing unusual about scrutiny of the judiciary by the parliament, more particularly by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is a simple situation where the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) inquired as to lack of progress in the Wik decision. The chief justice replied that such inquiry or criticism was unwarranted and he defended the court's position, saying that they had a heavy workload. That is as far as it has gone. There has been no personal attack on the judiciary or any member of it. In fact, the whole situation is being blown out of proportion. The opposition is trying to distort the situation, saying that there is indeed a personal, malicious attack on the judiciary when none exists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney-General (Mr Williams) has made comment in the past that attorneys&hyphen;general can no longer be expected to perform their traditional role of defending the courts in public. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 1 March he was reported as saying that the Australian Judicial Conference, which recently met, could well be an instrument to fulfil this function. For my part, I would see that as being a possibility. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of the same date, the Attorney-General pleaded for some peace in relation to this row.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Senator Bolkus says that the Attorney-General is not doing his job, he ought to refer to these two particular articles and think again. I look at the Attorney-General's role in this as being completely appropriate. His actions have been entirely in order. Indeed, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who has been attacked by the opposition, put things quite simply when he said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1082">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The perception has developed that some judges believe that it is their role to give parliament a hurry on and do things that they think parliament should have done. I can understand why some people have developed that perception.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Indeed, it was the former chief justice who said that there should be some judicial activism and, in fact, as some people would see it, some judicial legislation. When you have a former chief justice saying that, and when you have members of the judiciary who believe there should be some judicial activism, you cannot deny that the perception can reasonably grow from that that judges are hell-bent on some sort of judicial legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am saying is that there should always be scrutiny of the judiciary. That is a matter of fact. It is a part of the parliamentary process, part of the parliamentary role of this chamber. That was evidenced by the inquiry of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee into alleged gender bias in the judiciary. That is a matter of record and history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have is a situation where people have been critical of various judgments of the High Court. That is entirely appropriate. Indeed, Senator Bolkus, in his former role as minister for immigration, brought in legislation which was to overturn various judicial decisions relating to his portfolio. Previous governments have been no strangers to overturning various decisions of the judiciary. In fact, members of the opposition have a cheek when they say that we are trying to overturn the Wik decision. They ought to look at what they did in their last term of office.</PARA></SPEECH>

They are to apply a rule of law and they are to be consistent with the rule of law that must be applied. Unless we have a rule of law that stands above parliament, the executive and the courts themselves, we are all in trouble. It is our civil liberties that we have to protect. We do that by protecting the judges from undue criticism. Unfortunately, that is what has happened in recent times.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A major concern I have on this issue is that this is really another illustration of the adage that all that is necessary for evil to triumph is that good men do nothing&mdash;and I use the term `men' to mean both men and women. The situation here is that, once again, when a member of the community has stepped outside the boundaries of what is reasonable in a democratic process, this government, and in particular the Prime Minister, Mr  Howard, has not seen fit to make a statement which would indicate what the clear boundaries are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has happened once before; it is not a new matter. It happened before when that woman in the other place&mdash;and `that woman in the other place' is all I would like to refer to her as&mdash;made statements which, in my opinion, were completely beyond what is acceptable in a democratic community. I think this is another example of that occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the comments that have been made by both Mr Borbidge and Mr Fischer clearly go beyond the boundaries of what is reason

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="B36">Senator NEAL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is quite correct. In fact, Mr Borbidge said, `The current High Court, across large parts of Australia, is increasingly being held in absolute and utter contempt.' I do not see that as some sort of reasoned criticism or some sort of reasoned debate about the issue at hand&mdash;whether or not native title is extinguished by pastoral leases. I think it indicates that Mr Borbidge and other members of the National Party have no clear understanding of the fundamental division between the judiciary, parliament and the government. They seem to be unable to understand that, in order for the rights of Australians to be protected, the judiciary has one role in interpreting legislation and the parliament has another role in creating that legislation. It is not the proper role of members of parliament to criticise that interpretation, but there is a proper avenue for redress if they believe that the interpretation of the legislation put forward by the High Court is not in the best interests of Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Justice Brennan, in his letter, very clearly pointed out&mdash;this matter should be taken note of&mdash;that, if members are unsatisfied with the interpretation of legislation, they can properly bring another bill before the parliament and change the law, as is well within their democratic right. So Mr Fischer and other members of the National Party who do not agree with the interpretation of the High Court should not be undermining, criticising and trying to bring into contempt the High Court. They should be putting to their party members a proposal for legislation to be introduced into the parliament. That is their proper course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the problem is that members of the coalition government currently do not seem to have a great deal of respect for our constitution. Criticism of the High Court is not the only issue that people like Mr Borbidge have been dabbling in. In fact, Mr Borbidge seems 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1084"> to have indicated that he has no respect for the constitution in terms of the appointment of senators after others have resigned. In fact, as indicated, he may well, if the situation arises, not appoint a senator who is of the same party as a senator who has resigned or vacated their position. I think this is again illustrates that Mr Borbidge and members of the National Party have no regard whatsoever for the constitution and the High Court.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That we are opposed to any moves to cut funding to universities. We believe that further reductions in university funding would have a serious impact on the quality of higher education, and on access to university study for the Australian community. We emphasise that higher education has already absorbed substantial cuts in real funding levels over the last decade and that further reductions are unsustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, we believe that the principle of democratic access to higher education requires that undergraduate study should be provided free of up&hyphen;front tuition fees. We believe that any move to allow universities to charge up&hyphen;front undergraduate fees would fundamentally threaten this basic right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, we call on the Federal Government to provide supplementation through university operating grants so that university staff are adequately remunerated. We believe that the quality of higher education provided by universities is dependent in large part upon their ability to attract and retain appropriately qualified, skilled and experienced staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you will not cut university funding levels, nor allow universities to charge up&hyphen;front fees to undergraduate students. Universities must also be funded at levels which provide adequate remuneration for their staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA></SPEECH></PETITION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In reading between the lines of the ocean policy statement&mdash;and you have to do that because there is not a lot of substance in it&mdash;you find that this is a statement about producing an ocean policy through 1997 for the International Year of Oceans in 1998. So it is not actually an ocean policy statement; it is a statement about producing an ocean policy statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The usual code words for environmental sacrifice appear in the statement such as `multiple use'. It states that our coastal waters do not need to be clean only `clean enough', and that the offshore oil and gas industries apparently need `sufficient freedom'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard promises to do with the oceans what his government has been doing with our forests&mdash;and this is precisely what we are afraid of. Indeed, the analysis has a number of sinister connections. Trawling, for example, is every bit the marine equivalent of clear&hyphen;felling. When a forest is wood chipped, the species and structural diversity of the subsequent habitat is generally reduced, and ecology is skewed in favour of one or two economic species. All other plants and animals become by&hyphen;catch and are wasted. Forests become tree farms. Trawling is underwater tree clear&hyphen;felling. In taking the target economic species, such as prawns and scallops, reefs, seagrass beds, sponge beds, et cetera, are removed and with them the habitat of a host of non-target species. The by&hyphen;catch in most trawl fisheries greatly outweighs the take of target species.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that in relation to resource development, the government's policy will `range across all jurisdictions' which, in relation to by&hyphen;catch action plans, will only be developed for Commonwealth fisheries. We can only hope that this is not another reflection of the government's priorities. In recent times we have heard of experiments to blast reefs in the Great Barrier Reef to see what will happen, how much you can fish off a pristine reef to see what will happen, largely to get live fish for the live fish markets. It seems to me that we have forgotten what ecosystems are. I will be waiting carefully, as a lot of people will be, to see what the ocean policy will say.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also will be brief. While we welcome this statement, it is really a statement about producing a statement. I welcome it because as last we do seem to have yet certainly another step, as small as it may be, towards really addressing the many problems that are facing our marine environment. To actually put together a national plan to tackle the problems is certainly long overdue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At last count we had at least 26 reports, sitting on shelves gathering dust, each of which probably had been many months in the making, having had millions of dollars spent in putting them all together&mdash;reports on the marine environment simply sitting there and waiting for somebody to come and put them together and take up their recommendations. At last count there were some 1,500 agencies set up under 900 pieces of legislation, nationally, that cover the coastal zone. Therefore, at last we have a policy that looks like starting to bring it together. Indeed, the Democrats set out back in December 1994 with our Coastwatch strategy to try to do just that. We felt that the previous government, while again making the right noises, had waited far too long to do anything decisive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look through this statement, we see quite a number of positives&mdash;indeed, quite a number of bits and pieces that nobody would dare disagree with. But also there are, threaded through it, a number of statements that are a great cause for concern. There are some we have to agree with, such as `For too 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1098"> long government activity concerning our oceans has been ad hoc and disjointed; this has led to wastage of resources and less than optimal outcomes.' No-one could disagree with that. Then we go on and see the statement, `We want our coastal waters clean enough for people to safely enjoy swimming and surfing.' Obviously; that is something that everybody will agree with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we see around this country stormwater still as a major problem, still not being treated, still not being looked at as a waste in having it running out to sea when it should be reused. Around our coastline we have sewerage treatment works pumping out at best partially treated, and often untreated, sewerage. Also, we have catastrophes such as we have just seen at Wallis Lake. If the government's commitment is really there on some of these issues, it will take a lot more money than has been suggested is attached to this. Of course, we have to agree with another statement, `We want to ensure the unique biodiversity of our oceans is conserved for future generations.' Obviously no-one will disagree with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But then we start seeing some of those nasty little bits and pieces that are tucked away such as, `There can be balance; this is exactly what we are doing with the forests.' I noted, when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) put this down in the other place, he again emphasised the link between this strategy and our forest strategy. I have to say that, as our forests are being decimated, and in East Gippsland we now have an agreement to increase this rate of destruction, one really has to wonder what the plan is for our marine environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another problem I see is the way threaded through this we have emphasis on mining, emphasis on resource extraction. In other words, economic rationalism creeps back through here as a bottom line&mdash;`Yes, we will try to look after the environment but we will only really be worried about the environment if it is not going to interfere with short&hyphen;term economic gain.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the Prime Minister's statement on page 15:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The oceans policy will canvass issues such as nutrient flows from rivers, environmental performance of sewerage systems or else build responses in gaps in management regimes for pollutants.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">All of those issues are currently being looked at by the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee. So perhaps this is an indication that what that committee comes up with by way of finding and recommendations will be taken seriously by government and will be put in as part of the strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I obviously welcome a wide range of the initiatives. Indeed, as far as the albatross are concerned, those initiatives have already been announced. My recent visit to Macquarie Island gave me some first-hand experience. I spoke to the scientists there who are looking into the light&hyphen;mantled sooties, the black&hyphen;browed albatross and particularly the wandering albatross as to how precarious the existence of these species really is. I just emphasise here that the wandering albatross only fledged three chicks this year on Macquarie Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I would just say that what I think we have here is a statement that sounds great.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">FINANCIAL TRANSACTION REPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal object of these amendments is to give effect to several recommendations of Checking the Cash : A Report on the Effectiveness of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (FTR Act) by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators will recall that the principal act was part of the Commonwealth's package of legislation, developed following the Costigan Royal Commission into the Painters and Dockers Union, to combat organised crime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It erects barriers in Australia's financial sector to discourage use of the sector by criminals and allows the provision of financial intelligence to law enforcement and revenue agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It plays a major role as an intelligence tool, able to expose the illicit movement of money, particularly cash, and to facilitate the following of the money trail, both back to its source to identify the financiers and organisers of criminal enterprises, and outwards to locate the proceeds of crime, which may then be available for confiscation under the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1100"> another component of the anti-organised-crime package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTRAC is the agency constituted under the FTR Act to receive, analyse and distribute to law enforcement and revenue agencies information received from the cash dealers covered by the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendations of the Senate committee which were accepted by the Government and to which these amendments give effect are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 12&mdash;State and Territory revenue authorities to be allowed access to FTR information;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 15&mdash;an expanded definition of `transaction' to include, for the purpose of the reporting of suspicious transactions, preliminary negotiations which do not proceed to a concluded transaction;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 16&mdash;suspect transaction report information to be inadmissible in court proceedings;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 18&mdash;to increase the reporting threshold for imported and exported currency and to define the point at which currency is considered to have been exported;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 19&mdash;to require bullion sellers to identify customers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other main features of the bill are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It establishes a regime of reporting of significant transactions by solicitors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It consolidates AUSTRAC's existing powers of inspection, that is, powers to access and examine the records and record keeping systems of persons required to keep records under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It updates the penalty provisions of the act in accordance with current drafting practices, and aligns the quantum and expression of penalties with those in other Commonwealth statutes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It updates other specific provisions that contain superseded terminology or are otherwise in need of modernising; and, finally</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It makes minor technical amendments to correct minor drafting errors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As honourable senators will have noticed, many of the proposed amendments are of a legislative maintenance or house-keeping nature, of little effect other than to improve the useability or increase the clarity of the principal act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will speak in detail only about those proposed amendments which have a significant impact on the policy of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, let me mention the background to the proposal that State and Territory revenue authorities should have access to FTR information, leading to the proposed amendment of subsection 27(1) by Item 52 of Schedule 1. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The value of FTR information was brought home to States and Territories in the course of the National Crime Authority task force known as "Operation Quit", which involved the cooperation of the State and Territory revenue authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That was a task force established in 1990 following a preliminary investigation into suspect transaction reports which ultimately uncovered massive tobacco licence fee fraud covering several jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recoveries by the affected jurisdictions as a result of the task force were at least $10 million up to $20 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the task force was wound up, the State and Territory revenue authorities ceased to have access to FTR information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Understandably reluctant to give up a source of intelligence of such proven value in protecting the revenue, they made submissions to the Senate Standing Committee seeking regular access.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee was persuaded that their continued access was both reasonable and in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its only reservation was the concern that the privacy safeguards of the Privacy Act 1988, central to the Commonwealth legislation, would not apply to the State and Territory revenue authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As honourable senators may know, there is no equivalent State or Territory privacy legislation which would apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment deals with the privacy concerns by requiring a revenue authority of a State or Territory to undertake that it will comply with the Information Privacy Principles set out in section 14 of the Privacy Act before the Director of AUSTRAC may authorise it to have access to FTR information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That would appear to place the revenue agencies on a similar footing to Commonwealth agencies which are subject to the Privacy Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Failure to abide by the undertaking could result in loss of access to the FTR information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Item 16 of Schedule 1 amends section 3 by inserting subsection (7), adopting the committee's recommendation to make it clear that a `transaction' includes a proposal or negotiations for a transaction, in order to include negotiations terminated before completion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Transaction' is not defined in the principal act, and simply has its normal meaning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some situations suspicion may actually arise only from the fact that the person did not complete the transactions and that may occur upon learning of a requirement of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a clear investigative advantage in permitting as wide a range as possible of suspicious activity to be brought within the ambit of the act. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1101">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Item 30 of Schedule 1 amends section 16 of the act to make it clear that certain material in relation to suspect transaction reports is not admissible in any legal proceeding other than prosecutions under sections 29 or 30 for offences involving a cash dealer giving false and misleading or incomplete information in relation to obligations under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the course of consultation in developing this proposal, its purpose has sometimes been misunderstood.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not possible for the defence of an accused person to be unfairly impaired by the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, it is likely that the type of material covered by the provision would normally be held inadmissible in any event, failing to pass the test of relevance or on grounds of public interest immunity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Suspect transaction reports, the information contained in them, or information about whether such a report was prepared can never be evidence as to whether or not a person committed a particular offence or whether an investigation was properly carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That material or information is purely intelligence, a possible trigger for an investigation to obtain admissible evidence to prove a particular offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, from time to time attempts have been made by defence counsel to subpoena such material and the appropriate officer of a cash dealer, usually a bank teller.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the nature of the material, the purpose of such a subpoena can only be a form of fishing expedition, perhaps to discredit the teller in some way, or to confuse the jury about the significance of the material.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because such attempts have occurred, tellers are nervous about being subjected to hostile cross examination and, for several years, financial sector unions have sought protection for their members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is undoubtedly potential for any successful attempt to cross-examine a teller in an aggressive or humiliating way to permeate rapidly throughout the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effectiveness of the highly valued suspect transaction reports depends almost entirely on the willingness of front-line bank officers to observe the behaviour of clients and the nature of their transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a person's behaviour or transaction arouses suspicion that a taxation offence or a serious criminal offence may be involved, the teller files a report under section 16 of the FTR Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If tellers become intimidated it is likely that they will cease to form relevant suspicions and an invaluable source of criminal intelligence will dry up at its source. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I must emphasise that the admissibility of potentially relevant evidence that may be given by officers of financial institutions will not be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tellers, or any other officer if appropriate, may be called to give evidence, and be cross-examined on it, as to the identity of a defendant or the fact that a transaction occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final major amendment which I propose is contained in new section 15A of the principal act, Item 26 of Schedule 1 of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is not an amendment which was recommended by the Senate committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided that the Financial Transaction Reports Act should be amended to require solicitors to report to AUSTRAC all transactions with their clients of $10,000 or more in cash&mdash;that is, in currency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They would also be required to include in the report particulars of the client's identity, as known to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over a decade ago, in 1984, the Costigan Commission, the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, reported that some solicitors had let their trust accounts and perhaps their strong rooms be used as a means of parking and laundering illegally obtained funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission noted that, and I quote its Report</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"There is no doubt on a great deal of the evidence before me that certain solicitors have allowed their trust account, if not their strong rooms, to be employed as repositories for monies, the source of which, on any rational view, could only be illegal enterprises."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission's Report goes on to say that "By depositing monies with such solicitors, some hope or expectation is held that law enforcement agencies will have difficulty in locating the funds and in seeking explanations for them."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More recently, in 1991, the National Crime Authority undertook a study into money laundering in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It found that solicitors had often played a part in money laundering operations by assisting in the purchase of property in a way that disguised the source of the funds or the identity of the owner, for instance the use of false names, or "nominee companies" and through trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NCA found that solicitors also assisted money launderers by placing cash proceeds in trust accounts, for instance before settlement of property purchases, or for sending overseas (by wire transfer) or for returning to the criminal in the form of a loan. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1102">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another technique the NCA reported was used by solicitors was the arranging of false loans with other parties on behalf of criminals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The loans were repaid with the proceeds of criminal activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators may also recall that evidence presented to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in 1993 indicated that solicitors in some areas of Australia (in particular, suburban practices in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and the Gold Coast) are handling significant amounts of cash on behalf of clients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present exclusion of solicitors from the reporting provisions of the FTR Act could represent a loophole capable of being exploited by criminals seeking to evade those provisions for the purpose of evading tax or laundering the proceeds of crime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the anti-organised crime legislation was to create an environment hostile to the successful commission of crime, especially those crimes, such as drug offences, which generate large quantities of cash that needs to be laundered and which are likely to be associated with organised criminal enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any identified loophole which assists those seeking secretly to move or launder cash must be closed to maintain the integrity of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should make it quite clear that solicitors would not be subject to all the requirements which apply to cash dealers under the FTR Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They will not have to carry out the client identification requirements that apply to account opening; they will not be required to report suspect transactions, international funds transfer instructions, or to maintain the same record keeping systems as cash dealers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their obligations will be limited to reporting cash transactions of $10 000 or more, providing particulars of the client's identity as known to them and, if requested, providing access to records and record keeping systems to authorised AUSTRAC officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The obligations are not onerous.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Solicitors who never receive cash of $10 000 or more from a client will have no obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be no impact on such a practice at all, apart from the requirement to submit records from time to time for the inspection of AUSTRAC officials performing their compliance monitoring functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those monitoring powers are set out in proposed new section 27D in item 59 of Schedule 1.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proposed section 27E lays down the conditions which apply to an authorised AUSTRAC officer, including the giving of written notice and confining the inspection to business hours.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The solicitor is obliged to comply with the notice. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Failure or refusal to comply with the notice, or to comply with the reporting requirements of section 15A, constitutes an offence which attracts a penalty of two years imprisonment (subsection 28(3)).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining provisions of the bill improve the effectiveness of the principal act but do not introduce new policy or make any substantial changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunity is taken to insert a new Part VIA in the act (Item 59 of Schedule 1) to consolidate the inspection powers of staff of AUSTRAC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no substantive change to the powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill inserts a new Part IIIA (Item 49 of Schedule 1) dealing with bullion sellers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments require any person who is in the business of selling bullion to identify their customers, in the same way as a financial institution identifies its customers who open or operate accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments also rectify some technical problems with the definition of bullion dealers whereby some were able to escape the operation of the act, hence the alteration in concept from a bullion dealer to a bullion seller.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remainder of the bill makes technical amendments to update the penalty and offence provisions, eradicate superseded terminology, and correct minor drafting errors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are fully described in the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TRANS-TASMAN MUTUAL RECOGNITION BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill is to establish a scheme for the mutual recognition of regulatory standards for goods and occupations adopted in Australia and New Zealand. The principal aim of mutual recognition is to remove impediments to trans-Tasman trade in goods and the mobility of labour caused by regulatory differences among Australian jurisdictions and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill implements the trans-Tasman mutual recognition arrangement, which was signed by the prime minister, premiers and chief ministers at the meeting of the council of Australian governments held on 14 june 1996. The arrangement was subsequently signed by the prime minister of New Zealand on 9 july 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangement is consistent ,with the government's election commitment to reduce the regulatory burden and compliance costs faced by business and to establish a protocol for the reciprocal recognition of professionals' standing in order to promote the objectives of the closer economic relations trade agreement with New Zealand 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1103">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme is a fine example of what can be achieved cooperatively by the Australian federation. The states and territories were equal partners in the development of the trans-Tasman mutual recognition arrangement and the related Australian legislation has been drafted by new south wales</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government would like to acknowledge the positive contribution made by Australian heads of government in fostering and promoting this important development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed scheme is based on the framework of the&mdash;existing Australian Mutual Recognition Agreement, signed by Australian heads of government in May 1992. Legislation implementing the agreement has been proclaimed by the Commonwealth and all,states and territories. The Commonwealth legislation, the Mutual Recognition Act 1992, commenced in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The practical benefits of the Australian mutual recognition scheme have included:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Greater choice for consumers;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reduced compliance costs for manufacturers;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economies of scale in production leading to lower product costs;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Greater cooperation between regulatory authorities and the accelerated development of national standards where appropriate;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Greater discipline on individual jurisdictions contemplating the introduction of new standards and regulations; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increased movement of service providers and freedom for service providers to practise in jurisdictions in which they are not resident.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time of signing the domestic Australian mutual recognition agreement, Australian heads of government agreed to review in due course with New Zealand the potential benefits of participation by New Zealand in a scheme implementing mutual recognition principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian and New Zealand ministers subsequently agreed that the framework for mutual recognition reflected in the Australian Mutual Recognition Act 1992 should be the basis for a scheme implementing mutual recognition principles in New Zealand and Australian jurisdictions, with necessary changes to reflect the trans-Tasman nature of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The trans-Tasman mutual recognition arrangement was finalised after the release of a discussion paper in April 1995 by the Council of Australian Governments and the government of New Zealand. Input was sought from industry, standards setting bodies and the professions, and approximately 142 written submissions were received. The comments received during the consultation process have been taken into account in deciding upon the final lists of exemptions and exclusions from the scheme. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principles </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The trans-Tasman mutual recognition arrangement is a non treaty instrument which requests and empowers the Commonwealth to pass an act to give effect to two simple principles of mutual recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is that a person registered to practise an occupation in Australia can seek automatic registration to practise an equivalent occupation in New Zealand and vice versa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person will only need to give notice, including evidence of home registration, to the relevant registration authority in the other jurisdiction to be entitled immediately to commence practice in an equivalent occupation in that jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I stress that a person will only be entitled to practise an equivalent occupation. Equivalence means that the activities carried out by practitioners registered in each country must be substantially the same. This will be the case in most instances. However, if significant differences do exist between occupations, a registration authority may impose conditions on a person's registration in order to achieve equivalence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In essence, the scheme creates a situation similar to the regime in Australia for drivers' licenses, whereby individuals do not have to re-sit a driving test when they move from one state to another. It will apply to all registered occupations in Australia and New Zealand with the exception of medical practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second principle is that a good that can be legally sold in a participating Australian jurisdiction can be sold in New Zealand and vice versa, as long as it meets the regulatory requirements for sale in the jurisdiction in which it was manufactured or first imported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This means that goods which can be sold lawfully in one jurisdiction may be sold freely in another, even though the goods may not comply with all the details of regulatory standards in the second jurisdiction. Under mutual recognition, producers in Australia will have to ensure that their products comply with the laws only in the place of production. If they do so, they will then be free to distribute and sell their products in New Zealand without being subjected to further testing or assessment of their product.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Implementation mechanism</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth bill forms part of a larger legislative scheme that involves the enactment of bills by the states, the Commonwealth and New Zealand. The larger legislative scheme has an Australian component and a New Zealand component.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The trans-Tasman mutual recognition bill 1996 of New Zealand is concerned with the New Zealand 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1104"> component of the legislative scheme. That bill was introduced into the parliament of New Zealand on 18 July 1996. However, passage has been delayed by the New Zealand election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In drafting the New Zealand bill every effort has been made to closely reflect the Australian legislation, whilst also recognising New Zealand's different legislative conventions. This approach is intended to minimise the potential for disputes to arise from differences in the interpretation of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mechanism for implementing the Australian component of the scheme is similar to that used to implement the Australian mutual recognition scheme. To come into effect, the scheme requires at least one state to enact legislation referring the enactment of a mutual recognition act to the Commonwealth Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New South Wales has agreed to do so, and the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition (New South Wales) Bill 1996, was proclaimed on 4 December 1996. The New South Wales bill refers to the Commonwealth parliament, using the mechanism provided by Section 51 (XXXVII) of the Commonwealth Constitution, the power to enact an act in the terms, or substantially in the terms, set out in the schedule to that bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The additional powers of the Commonwealth will be limited. The states and territories are not granting extensive new powers to the Commonwealth to regulate goods and occupations. Rather, the Commonwealth is being empowered, to the extent to which I such powers are not otherwise included in its legislative powers, to pass a single piece of legislation that will prevail over inconsistent state and territory legislation. Amendments to the Commonwealth act will require the unanimous agreement of participating Australian jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth act will provide a comprehensive scheme for mutual recognition which will operate independently of other state laws and therefore will not require modification of those laws to enable its implementation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that I am in continuation. Just to recap, when I spoke on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996 last Tuesday, it was clear that this particular bill had four aspects to it. My understanding is that just a moment ago the government withdrew its intention to charge massive fees for newly arrived migrants to learn English. That measure would have seen more than a doubling of the cost to migrants to learn English. We approve the discharge of that particular provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week&mdash;I believe it was on Tuesday&mdash;I made note of the Australian Democrats' policy platform and the fact that with our population and immigration policy, we seek to balance the competing objectives of and responsibility for environmental sustainability, social justice and a sustainable sovereign economy. In this regard we distinguish ourselves from all other parties in this place and perhaps all other senators in this chamber, but particularly the coalition government in both policy and substance. It is a position which I am particularly proud to represent today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats' position has been clear and consistent in regard to the family reunion categories. Unlike the government, we believe that spouse, children and even aged parents, with all the fees and charges they have to pay to come to Australia, add value to our society. We do not believe in some kind of socially engineered immigration program or some kind of economically rationalised intake of immigrants. We believe that individuals should be valued on their merits and that being wealthy in itself is neither meritorious nor a particularly sophisticated social view. That said, this schedule seeks to give the government an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1106"> other dimension of power that I believe it already has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned the Democrat position in regard to the capping powers, which the government asserts are necessary to enable it to manage all parts of its migration program. I can assure the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) and the department today that should your government choose a path in regard to capping that is harsh, oppressive or discriminatory, we will be watching closely and  will certainly bring you up to speed and scrutinise that particular path if that is chosen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the quite shaky start we have had to this debate, the government has indicated that their sole objective in enacting schedule 2 is to usher in a more flexible and compassionate administrative regime&mdash;capping and cuing instead of capping and killing, which is considered more compassionate. Indeed, it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A closer scrutiny of the effects of this bill, as well as the minister's assertions, have persuaded us that, on balance, the government of the day should possess such flexibility in determining the immigration program in this country. The question is not whether the government is going to cap but how they will do it. I have made that very clear in all the migration or immigration debates we have had in this place&mdash;not so much the numbers that have been brought in but how we are treating people before they get here and once they come into this country. The Australian Democrats will be supporting a more humane way of managing the migration program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What seems to have been left out of this entire debate is the total population picture, the whole policy issue of population. It is clear the Australian Democrats' policies speak very clearly of sustainable population levels. The population debate, as opposed to the immigration debate, is a discussion we are yet to have in this country. I am glad to see that in recent months the Australian Labor Party have begun discussing the issue of population policy. I would wish to acknowledge that the Democrats have had such a policy almost since our inception and I look forward to the government coming forward with a compre 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hensive and sophisticated discussion of population issues in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are to speak about population in this country, we must also speak about the rural decline that is occurring in Australia. We need to speak about the people already here in Australia who are increasingly moving to our already overburdened eastern seaboard. And&mdash;Senator Harradine should be here for this&mdash;we should begin to talk about birthrates as well. This underlines our commitment to environmental sustainability, so any population discussion must have regard to the impact on our natural heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 3 of the bill proposes to implement an exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 in relation to the making of certain regulations which will discriminate between de facto and de jure couples. It is a provision which seeks to socially engineer the types of relationships that are important in Australia. This amendment was initially aimed at implementing a two&hyphen;year cohabitation period for de facto couples before they could apply for Australian citizenship. Although I understand that the proposal will now be for a one&hyphen;year period, this does not necessarily change the original policy concerns we had regarding this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government are attempting to develop regulations which discriminate on the ground of marital status. Thus, it is necessary for them to amend the Migration Act to allows its regulation making powers to override the Sex Discrimination Act. The government recently introduced the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1996, which aims to limit the number of exemptions for legislation in relation to the SDA. At the time, the government stated that the bill `reflects the government's commitment to equal opportunity and the prevention of discrimination'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats noted, during debate on this bill, the inconsistency of this ostensible policy position with the proposed exemption from migration regulations, in certain circumstances, from the SDA. The fact that the proposed exemption is placed in the Migration Act makes any understanding of the anti&hyphen;discrimination regime extremely 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1107"> confusing for anyone in the Australian public. It could be said that, if the government wishes to introduce discriminatory legislation, it should do so by explicitly amending the Sex Discrimination Act, not via a backdoor attempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The underlying policy objective of the proposed amendment is that de facto marriages are more likely to be unstable or less likely to be as strong and long as perhaps other types of marriages. It is strongly arguable that this view is antiquated and out of step with current Australian society. In fact, nearly all submissions to the Senate committee's inquiry into this bill put this view. Several noted that it reflected the views voiced in 1960 by the then minister for immigration, the Hon. A.R. Downer, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An immigration policy that smiles on illicit unions would not be in the interests of the Good Life of the Australian community. Those who wish to live in such a way should not expect an easy entry into this country.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A rather outdated view, I should think. The proposed cohabitation rules are almost impossible to fulfil if one's partner is not an Australian citizen and the non&hyphen;citizen partner cannot easily get temporary visas either in or out of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Besides explicitly discriminating on the ground of marital status, the proposals also significantly discriminate against women. Firstly, in many countries, divorces are either extremely difficult to obtain for women or impossible for women to initiate. Therefore, a de facto relationship is the only option a woman will have for forming a new relationship if the old marriage has failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Council of Churches in Australia made a similar point in their submission to the Senate inquiry when they stated that, in many communities, a two&hyphen;year cohabitation period prior to marriage was impossible. Therefore, it would be impossible for those people who exercised their right to live in de facto marriages to enter Australia. In the council's view, `The government should be primarily concerned with the couple rather than the couple's community,' which prohibited de facto marriages.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even more seriously, there has been significant research recently that there is a disproportionate amount of violence against migrant women in Australia. Examples are research by Dr Patricia Esteal of the Australian National University and by the Australian Law Reform Commission in their report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Equality before the law</EMPHASIS>. Women without independent residential status in Australia are particularly vulnerable to such violence. The threat of a de facto relationship being broken can always be used to force them not to seek the intervention of the law in an abusive relationship. I note that the coalition law and justice policy stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prevalence of violence against women and family violence in our community is of deep concern and will not be tolerated by a Liberal and National government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Finally, the migration regulations currently contain extremely detailed definitions of what constitutes a `spouse' for the purposes of the Migration Act. The focus of this definition is on ensuring that the relationship is bona fide via a series of well&hyphen;established tests, including joint bank accounts, letters, phone bills and other well&hyphen;established indicators. We consider that there are already appropriate mechanisms and definitions within this bill and, for that reason, are greatly concerned about the attempts to seek exemption from the SDA in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the issue of capping and queuing, the Democrats will be supporting the government's measure. Our main concerns now relate to the exemption from the SDA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I think the issue of the population debate&mdash;as opposed to the immigration debate&mdash;is a debate that we have to have in this country. We are yet to have it. I commend the ALP on their efforts recently in regard to establishing a policy in this area. I look forward to seeing similar objectives and work undertaken by the government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By way of background to this debate on migration legislation, I am sure senators will know that when this bill was last before the Senate the opposition opposed it strongly. It is worth reflecting now that when the debate came on last week, indication was given by the government that there had been 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1108"> some significant discussions between the government and the opposition spokesperson, Duncan Kerr. Those discussions have led to significant and welcome concessions from the government. Of course, there do remain some fundamental differences between both sides of parliament. Although a number of issues have been addressed in this legislation and we have sought to find some suitable middle ground in respect of most of them, there are still some areas in dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to recognise that discussions have led to an accommodation of different points of view in respect of most parts of the government's proposals in this area. For instance, as was noted just before this legislation was called on, the government has agreed to separate the English education charge from the bill in order that the remainder of the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill may proceed, and as a consequence we find our way through to overcoming some of the problems in that area. I also should note at this particular stage that the government undertakes that the regulations which need to follow the passage of the bill will set the English education charge at the current rate, including the concession rate, and that the ceiling will also be set at its current level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think what this bill does and what the recent history on this bill does is show the difference in attitudes on this side of the parliament as opposed to the other side. We have seen the measures that were rejected by the Senate at the last debate bandied around by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock). In a sense, we have seen them using the immigration stick to try to belt the Senate around. And they have done so in a way which I think has been ill informed and dishonest in terms of the debate and quite inappropriate in terms of the way immigration really needs to be discussed, especially in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On our side of parliament we believe that the best way to discuss immigration is not to use it as a political tool in the way that it has been used but to use it as the basis of and as a result of informed debate. We should 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> recognise, for instance, that family migration has been and continues to be important; that a lot of people with skills come into Australia as part of the family migration program; and that, though English is desirable, people who do not speak English have made and continue to make a massive contribution to this country. I think those sorts of recognitions and a recognition of the continued importance of migration to Australia, particularly in the global environment, are something that need to be stressed, not just by one in five speeches by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs or not just under his breath by the Prime Minister. They need to be stressed consistently and continually so that there is informed debate in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not have that. To the contrary, we have claims that the skilled component of the migration program is at an all&hyphen;time low. If one were to look at the overall migration program and look at the levels of skills that people who come in under the family reunion part of the migration program bring with them, one would find, as I was advised consistently by officials, that we have at the moment levels of skills which are at an all&hyphen;time high. That is something that needs to be stressed by this government and something that needs to be picked up, I think, by commentators who look at this issue with blinkers on. I think the responsibility is on government to stress the reality, the facts, the fundamental characteristics of a program which delivers, not just in the skilled part of the program but also in the family reunion part, high levels of skill concentration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that needs to be made is that this bill is not about levels of migration. We have made it very clear from this side of the parliament&mdash;Duncan Kerr has stated it often&mdash;that the opposition does not take issue with the government on the size of the program it announced for 1996&hyphen;97. In fact, when he announced the program, Minister Ruddock took the trouble to say in his media release that the size of the program was about the average of the previous four years of Labor government. You cannot say that and then say that Labor allowed the program to get out of control, as the minister says. If it is out of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1109"> control, where are the massive cutbacks? If it is out of control, why are we still talking about levels the average of those of the previous four years of Labor government? The reality is that the minister has been talking in code in this area and wants to give the impression to people in the community that he is going to wind back enormously on migration when, as I said, he says that the program is about the average of the previous four years of Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the language is language which is designed to tap into a reactionary vein in the community and I think it is something which is quite unfortunate in this debate. If the program was out of control, why didn't the coalition say so explicitly before the election? If it was out of control in the family reunion part, why before the election did the coalition commit itself to specifically providing priority to family reunion within a program of similar size to the one that we had managed? Those who have taken an interest in this debate know that there were some direct effects of the 1 November decision of just a few years ago and those effects were always going to be felt for a short term in the program. To the extent that there is a blip in the program, we ought to recognise that that has been the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, we on this side of parliament would rather get into the reality of the benefits of migration and not indulge in what one public commentator on the broader racism debate put quite aptly as dog whistling. Dog whistling is a technique where the message is coded and is pitched at a certain frequency&mdash;a frequency at which a certain audience is expected to be tuned in; a frequency that is directed to that audience but can be denied whenever necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is regrettable that any member of this parliament should indulge in such practice; it is despicable that some government members have done so. But let me say two things. Whilst some are doing it, many, I think, however silently, would join us in rejecting some of these measures, as well as the concept of dog whistling. I think it is really unfortunate that those involved in dog whistling include the Prime Minister. It is all about playing to racist sentiments with sugar&hyphen;coated 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> language, and it really does this country no service in the short term or the long term for that to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I say that this legislation does reflect a different attitude to migration. On our side we would rather recognise the contribution of migration; we would rather recognise all those things I mentioned earlier. We do not think there is value in the technique of dog whistling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key issue in this bill is the measure that would allow the minister to limit or cap the number of spouse, aged parent and dependent children visas that can be granted in any one year. We on this side of parliament are concerned about a minister having introduced that sort of measure. They could have looked at alternative ways if they were concerned about the numbers coming in, but they have not chosen to do so. The approach taken by the government is one that is objectionable in that it has the direct impact of breaking up families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let there be no mistake about the issue of capping the spouse visa. It is not one of immigration alone. It is all to do with the violation of the rights of every Australian. Whether the Australian has been a citizen for one day or for six generations, whether that Australian is of Chinese, Greek, Vietnamese, Lebanese, African or English descent, it is all about violating that person's right to have a family and to be with that family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation makes a mockery of the Prime Minister's commitment to families. It undermines any capacity that people in these circumstances have to be together. In essence, it produces two sorts of families. You can have two sorts of families living in the same street: those who have a right to be together and those who, under this legislation, would be separated because of the government taking a deliberate measure to either cap and kill or cap and queue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this legislation were to be passed by the parliament, it would mean that any such Australian would have his/her right to choose to marry restricted. The government has already made it clear that it intends to set a limit on the number of spouse visas that can be issued in each year. This will mean that, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1110"> if you are a long-term resident and citizen of Australia and are travelling or working overseas&mdash;as it is increasingly more common for people to do so; I think we find tens of thousands of Australians doing it every year these days&mdash;and you meet a person whom you decide to marry and to bring back with you to start a family, you can be lucky if you make the decision early enough in the life of the program when there are still some visas to be granted. But too bad if you meet that person towards the end of the program. In those circumstances, `try again and good luck for next year' is the attitude that the government is taking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is objectionable enough in respect of spouses. It is equally unthinkable in the case of dependent children. There are many scenarios that will arise and do arise. The parent may be in Australia and their children are overseas, or the relationships are born overseas, as are the kids. What we are going to have here is the situation where we will have parents in Australia who, year after year, will be unable to have their dependent children in their care. There are cases, for instance, involving broken marriages. There are cases where the child may be the subject of abuse. There may be one parent overseas and the parent in Australia is unable to bring that child to Australia simply because this government is setting the maximum number of dependent children that can be sponsored. You are simply playing lottery with the lives of families in this respect, and that magic number may have been reached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These scenarios are not hypothetical. There are already cases where people need to bring their dependants and their spouses here quickly. The sorts of barriers that the minister is putting in place are barriers that will call the immigration policy into public disrepute. When the minister says, `These measures are crucial to restoring public confidence in immigration,' I think he may have that objective, but there is no doubt that the sorts of measures he is continuing to propose will have a directly contradictory effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not need to forever quote what the current minister said about policies that keep families separated. We do not need to go back 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the statements he made in 1989, where he said that it was unconscionable for a government to say halfway through the year, `We've had spouses now. We're going to close off that category. No more people in that category can come to Australia.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was talking then of a proposal that the previous government did not proceed with. He said at the time that he was pleased to see that the government had not chosen that course. Senator Harradine, we were in government at that time, and I am pleased to say that I did not resort to measures like this over the last three or four years when I was responsible for immigration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So if you look at the migration program&mdash;look at the minister's claim that it is out of control, look at the figures over recent years, look at planning levels, look at outcomes and look at the points that people need to obtain to migrate&mdash;you can very quickly come to a conclusion that there are other alternatives that this government could have taken. But the government wanted to play politics with this issue, and that is what they have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the interim period, since this legislation was last debated in this place, Duncan Kerr has had discussions with the government in an endeavour to find a reasonable way to remove the heat from this debate. I think it is fair to say that Mr Kerr thought that we had reached agreement whereby the government would be able to cap and queue the aged parent category but not proceed with the other capping arrangements in terms of spouses and children. We do have a responsibility for caring for our elderly parents. That is one we should respect. The opposition has, in discussions between the minister and Mr Kerr, come to what we think is an arrangement whereby the government would proceed with one, but we will oppose the introduction of capping and killing, particularly killing, when it comes to the rest of the family, spouses and children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on at length in respect of these issues, but I think I should address the issue of the Sex Discrimination Act and the arrangement that was reached there. Senator Stott Despoja talked about that, both today 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1111"> and last week. I think one of the clear objectives of the discussions between the shadow minister and the minister has been to recognise that we really cannot dictate an outcome from our side. We would like to have some influence in terms of the policy that finally gets through this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although we have had in principle objection to amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act, the arrangement that was finally reached is one where, at the end of the day, the impact of the government's measures is much less than it would have been had they got what they set out to get, and had what they set out to get went through this parliament. The impact is minimised by the fact that we are not talking here about discrimination as against one sex in terms of the letter of the law, but I do take the point that we need to monitor closely the operation of this law to ensure that, in practice, women are not affected and disadvantaged in the way that some people have feared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, I think the full impact of the overall operation of this exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act that the government is seeking needs to be closely monitored&mdash;and I am sure it will be&mdash;to ensure that people are not disadvantaged in the way that many witnesses before the Senate committee process fear they might be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking here of a proposal which the government has agreed to tone down&mdash;to radically reduce the cohabitation period from two years to one year. As a consequence of that government undertaking to reduce the cohabitation period from two years to one year, the opposition has felt able to support the amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act in the belief that the legislation would not in practice have the negative effect that has been feared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn finally to the question of citizenship. In this particular area we have been on the record as saying that the opposition could give in principle support for the measure but that we did have concerns about its open&hyphen;endedness in respect of the proposed citizenship provisions and about the capacity to make some people, particularly children, stateless as a consequence.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition welcomes the supplementary explanatory memorandum, which Minister Ruddock has tabled in the House. It is one that was brought forward at the opposition's request. It clarifies what the government means by its action. The government intends to act in cases where there is an intention to defraud. That being the trigger point in terms of implementation of the amendments to the citizenship provisions, it is clear that the opposition can support the government with respect to amendments that cover citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have concerns about the question of statelessness. A person, by accepting Australian citizenship, may have found themself to be without citizenship of their former country. There is a capacity under these provisions that, maybe 20 or 30 years later, they might even lose Australian citizenship. This question needs to be addressed. There are international conventions in place to avoid persons becoming stateless. Minister Ruddock was asked in the House to come back to parliament on this issue when the bill came before the Senate. We would like to hear something of the government's position in respect of this before we take a vote on this particular proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been extensive discussions in the last few weeks in respect of this legislation. The government has amended the legislation quite substantially. As a consequence of this, I think we will find much more of it getting through the Senate today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While this legislation merges fees so that there is a single application fee for immigrants to Australia, it has the massive impact of limiting the number of spouse, aged parent and dependent children visas by ministerial discretion. This is what the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) himself calls `cap and kill' when referring to the queues of people waiting to come into Australia. The term could also adequately refer to the aspirations of people wanting to join their families under sometimes very emotive and distressing circumstances. This legislation also enables the minister to prescribe a two&hyphen;year cohabitation period in respect of applicants who apply offshore for migration on the basis of a de facto or inter 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1112"> dependency relationship with an Australian citizen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with this legislation is that it is really scapegoating immigrants to this country on the altar of a change in direction by the government with regard to immigration policy. This is in response to well&hyphen;versed concerns about multicultural Australia, about the make&hyphen;up of this country and about unemployment in the country. The problem with the response the government is making is that the rich and powerful, and their families, will be able to get to the front of the queue. Those who are not in that position and who are wanting to be united with their families will stay out, in many cases, under this new legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By keeping migrants from accessing benefits in times of hardship&mdash;we have seen that legislation recently in this place&mdash;the government began a process of divisiveness in the community, I believe. This legislation accentuates that process. It is a divisiveness which says that it is going to be more difficult than it was in the past, under a policy that most Australians were relaxed about, for people to come to this country, not least those with aspirations for family reunion. When they do get here, it is going to be more difficult for them to survive. The hardship is put before the barrier and after the barrier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look into the reasons behind this legislation, you will find that there is a favouritism emerging towards the rich, particularly business migrants. For $12,500, a rich person can enter into the race to come into Australia, while family reunions are being so-called capped and killed. There is no doubt, whatever figure is put on the amount required for business immigrants, that in relation to whether or not you can get into this country we are going more towards a policy of `it depends on what you've got, not what your relationships are or what your need is'. The proposed amendments are going to make coming to Australia more difficult for the spouses, children and aged parents of people already here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the real effort here to make it more difficult for people who are not married to come into the country. There is an inevi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> table effort to separate those who have undertaken the marriage process to come into the country from those who have equally legitimate relationships&mdash;so-called de facto or interdependent relationships. There is a separation of the requirements instead of a convergence, as we have seen in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interdependent relationships can be seen as a grab bag, but they do include people who have a great reliance upon each other for one reason or another. I am told that a majority of these people are in same sex relationships. The question that immediately arises is: why do those people find that there are more onerous conditions placed on them to come into the country? I would have thought we were past the age of discriminating on those grounds. Yet this legislation has a very strong tenor of increased discrimination on those grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is remarkable that the government, in tightening the rules in respect of people in heterosexual de facto relationships, is chipping away at the sex discrimination legislation. It is certainly recreating some of the difficulties that partners in a heterosexual de facto  relationship have experienced in the past. The barrier is going to be higher for them than it is for people who have married.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, for those reasons, the bill is not one that I find acceptable. It is going to save the government some money&mdash;$5 million this year and $19 million next year. But that, of itself, is neither here nor there. I think the government itself would say that&mdash;although any measure that saves it money and cuts down on the public welfare bill seems to it to be a welcome measure, whatever the consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are very strong arguments as to why this legislation should not be accepted as it is. There will be amendments seeking to improve it. But, ultimately, I have to say that we would be better staying with the legislation we have. We would be better trying to maintain the current level of immigration. The temporary increase in applications on the basis of family reunion have resulted because of the extra people, particularly young people, who stayed in this country as a result of the Tiananmen Square massacre and because of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1113"> the fears that 10,000 Australians had about returning to China at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arguments for this legislation are weak. They echo arguments of the past. The arguments against it are strong and humanitarian. They are under the banner of `a fair go for all' and across the doormat of `welcome' to this country, particularly for those who have a humanitarian need or are in distressing circumstances. The government is taking the wrong direction with this legislation. It can be patched up, it can be ameliorated, but it would be better if it were not here.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Had the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996 come on for debate at the end of last year, I suspect the second reading debate the chamber is taking part in now would have been completely and utterly different. I make that point&mdash;and make it very strongly&mdash;not to score any political points but merely to put on the record the fact that the major players in the parliament on matters to do with immigration have actually had the opportunity to sit down and talk and reach some understanding and agreement about where we go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to put a bit history of the bill on the record and, in doing so, to make a point about the workload that is from time to time imposed upon committees of the parliament. It has been mentioned by previous speakers in this second reading debate that this bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report in the latter part of last year. That committee, under the then chairmanship of Senator Ellison, undertook that inquiry and reported only a matter of days after its original reporting date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That happened at a time when the Senate was sitting for four weeks continuously. Prior to that we had what was supposed to be, and what people outside see as, a one-week break from the parliament when parliamentarians do not do anything. Before that we had two weeks of sitting. So, out of seven weeks, the parliament sat for six weeks. In the seventh week, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee had to address itself to matters contained in this bill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That happened way back in November last year. Definitely there was a sense of urgency about the matter, but here we are in March 1997 actually debating it. As one of the players in the committee at that time, I sometimes wonder about the schedules and time frames that we are asked to work under from time to time. That was brought to mind in a different reference that is before the same committee. We discussed that issue at length this morning after quite elaborate inquiry and consultation with the community. But that is something for a different debate. I put on the record the sorts of time frames under which Senate committees are required to report and present their deliberations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth noting that, when the committee's report was presented to the parliament, the bill that was before the committee did not receive unanimous support of committee members and indeed the participating members of the committee. Despite the attractiveness of it, I will not try to score cheap political points about my colleagues on the committee, some of whom who signed the minority report now find themselves, as a result of the negotiations that have taken place between the government, the opposition and indeed the Democrats&mdash;I understand they, too, were involved in them&mdash;agreeing to some changes. Some changes have satisfied some of the concerns some members who signed the minority report have, including one of the previous speakers, Senator Stott Despoja.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is on the record that we can&mdash;I think this is a welcome approach&mdash;with maturity, sit down and talk about these things. The government and the opposition certainly sat down and talked about them after an extensive debate in the House of Representatives just before parliament rose for the Christmas break. In preparing for this contribution this afternoon it had been my intention to refer to some government members' comments in that debate. However, to do that now might bring further division into this debate, and I do not believe that anybody in the Australian community needs further divisive debate on immigration in this country. There are too many players out there seeking and playing a spoiling role in the affairs of this country and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1114"> unfortunately using the immigration debate and migrants to fuel their own points of view. I do not believe they are operating for the benefit of Australia in offering those views to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are debating Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) and not indeed, as Senator Stott Despoja mentioned, population or population issues per se. Certainly this bill relates to populations, and she acknowledged that my party, the Australian Labor Party, embarked on a debate about population issues. It is not all that recently that we did embark on that debate. It has been the subject of debate within the parliamentary party ever since I became a member of this parliament and it is a debate which I wholeheartedly welcome and have participated in. I welcome the enhanced measures that the current spokesperson for my party has introduced to it in recent months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate is ongoing, and I hope that it can be much more constructive than some of the debates we have had surrounding immigration. I think that, as the debate progresses, people in our community and indeed our parliament will seek to play a spoiling role on the issue of population just as they have on the issue of migration. It is very unfortunate that many of the people who have played that spoiling role are indeed migrants who have forgotten that they have been blessed with the opportunity of coming here. Maybe it was not their decision; it may have been a parental decision. Nevertheless, they are the ones taking advantage of the fact that Australia is an open society that does allow and indeed invites migrants into its community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Being able to migrate to a country such as Australia is a very great privilege. I am one of the beneficiaries and one of the people who have taken a very strong line on immigration. I have done so in the time I have been in this parliament and certainly before I entered parliament. I, like many others in this chamber and the parliament, support a migration program. In doing so, we are supporting&mdash;I acknowledge this&mdash;in part a population issue, although migration and migration legislation are not the exact place to start with it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been active in the area of migration legislation since I entered parliament. Because of that, and because of particularly my enhanced activity in immigration debates in recent years, I was very surprised when the current Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) made the comment in his second reading speech to this bill that `Labor had allowed immigration to get seriously out of control'. When we look objectively at the facts, we see they do not stand up to that statement the minister made in his second reading speech. The facts just do not stand up at all when we analyse them. Indeed, the minister, by his own words, contradicted himself. When he offered the statistics he drew attention to the fact that what was being proposed for this current financial year in the intake of migrants matched pretty neatly and closely what had happened in the latter years of the Labor Party administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I think comments such as `Labor has allowed immigration to get seriously out of control' should not be made by any minister who claims to be a responsible minister for immigration. I hope that the minister notes the fact that he has not sought to substantiate those claims and that he should take the opportunity to refute and back away from remarks like that. In the current climate in this country, where some people are trying to whip up a racist debate, comments such as the one the minister made do not help the situation at all. He should be adopting a much more constructive and responsible role in parliamentary utterances rather than making comments such as the one he made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make a few points on the matters currently under issue in the bill and the arrangements and understandings that have been reached between the government and other parties in the Senate. My colleague Senator Bolkus in his contribution canvassed the issues very thoroughly. I am not going to use all of the time allocated to me in this debate this afternoon to further those comments. I think the comments stand on the record to speak for themselves. However, I am disappointed with the position the Austral

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not go too heavy. I was very pleased to have an understanding prior to this debate and indeed last week of what the Democrats' position was on that issue, because it certainly was one of the matters that were the subject of intense negotiations between the parties in recent weeks. When I heard Senator Stott Despoja on her feet making her comments that the Democrats' support would go to the government when it came to a vote on the matters, I was disappointed. But, if there are further issues being debated, I think the safest thing for me to do would be to pass over this issue and perhaps come back to it if necessary during the committee stage of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Schedule 3 of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996, if enacted, would provide subordinate law makers with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the ability to set criteria&mdash;different from those they set for a married person&mdash;for a de facto spouse to meet before he or she obtains a visa. That people have a genuine personal and persisting commitment to each other can often be more readily demonstrated when they are married than when they are in a de facto relationship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidentiary issues involved in proving the two relationships are distinct, and accordingly there is a good reason for having discrete tests for each of them. But it is not good enough to justify the passing into law of proposed section 507 of the Migration Act 1958 as set out in schedule 3, because to do so would empower the makers of subordinate legislation to override the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. Were this to happen, it would place too great a strain on the meagre mechanisms that presently exist to protect human rights in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The certainty that fairness permeates its social institutions, that everyone is equal before the law and that fundamental rights are held inviolable is essential to a decent society. To ensure this certainty some countries&mdash;for example, the United States of America and Canada&mdash;have a bill of rights. Australia does not. Many of its people consider it should have one. Others hold the contrary view and maintain that the common law, appropriate conventions and discrete statutory provisions are the best safeguards for the liberties and entitlements of its citizens. In any event, most Australians believe that there must be effective mechanisms in place to enable them to vindicate their civil rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth parliament has responded to this belief by enacting a limited but vital body of legislation. Included in this are the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. So essential are these to the wellbeing of the community that their operation should be suspended, if ever, in only the most exceptional circumstances. No such circumstances exist to justify the passing of schedule 3 of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we as federal parliamentarians pass proposed section 507 as set out in schedule 3, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1116"> we demonstrate not only our readiness to interdict the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act ourselves but also our willingness to delegate that power to the makers of subordinate legislation. This bodes ill for the strength and standing of Australia's human rights law. There is much to be worried about where the Commonwealth parliament is prepared to see the operation of one of its own civil liberty statutes suspended to make it easier for government to administer applications for visas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What vice does schedule 3 seek to remedy? How many migrants are coming to Australia under the guise of being de facto spouses when in fact they are not? Indeed, how many people come here under that description in any event? How difficult is it for the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to establish whether a relevant person is or is not a de facto spouse? Whatever the answers to these questions, they are most unlikely to justify what is, in effect, either the rescission of human rights legislation or the delegation of the power to do so to subordinate law makers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A seemingly good reason is often advanced to legitimise the setting aside of civil liberties. But each time that happens the quality of Australia's regime for protecting human rights is put at risk. This is the case in the present instance where, no doubt with the best of intentions, the government seeks to prevent the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act in certain circumstances. It wants to render ineffective legislation the purpose of which is to further people's rights and liberties. This is hardly a good thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although proposed section 507 may make good administrative sense, the legislature should not embrace it. Over a period parliament can, for a succession of reasons, each of which appears compelling at the time it arises, whittle away the regime of civil rights in Australia. The problem with this legislation is that it tries to do something that seems eminently sensible: that is, provide for a position where a stable relationship can be proved, but in different ways. In one case it can be proved by producing a marriage certificate, and in another case by introducing other 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> evidence. People say, `Look, that is a fairly sensible thing to do,' and so it would seem. But the consequences of doing that, as proposed section 507 says, is that provision has to be made to set aside the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 in so far as it would interfere with the making of these regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there are some real problems that we as a parliament face at the moment. We had a debate earlier in the day about the position of the High Court and where it enters into the field that people allege is a legislative field. They say it should not do that: that it should keep out of that field; that we as parliamentarians should be the only ones to legislate. Our position in saying that would be much better if we were to be more jealous, I think, of issues of human rights. In this case it is not a dramatic attempt to suborn the human liberties that we enjoy. But it is, nevertheless, an instance where for what is, no doubt, seen as a good reason, but is an insufficient reason, this act is set aside.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message that goes out is that we would suspend the Sex Discrimination Act fairly readily if we thought there was a need. If we are ready to do that, then why have the act at all? Perhaps we ought to leave our civil rights to the attention of the common law&mdash;in other words, the common law&hyphen;maker; the court system, at the pinnacle of which is the High Court. Perhaps the High Court has got a greater sense of justice&mdash;a `feel' for those rights that we all consider are the rights any decent society should enjoy. I think that this particular provision is an occasion when we should pause and work out what we are doing. I also would like to comment on schedule 4. There are some concerns with that, but I think I will leave that to the committee stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to contribute briefly to this debate. I feel my colleague, Senator Cooney, has raised the area of concern that I have with this bill. I first of all would like to put on the public record that it concerns me that the government has given a number of indications, in respect of some of the elements that are contained in the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996, that it is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1117"> responding to some of the myths and prejudices that have come out in the past year's race debate. While I acknowledge that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) and the shadow minister for immigration, Mr Duncan Kerr, have negotiated and that some of the impacts are less&mdash;of course, compromise is always welcome&mdash;nevertheless, I have grave concerns about meddling with the Sex Discrimination Act. If it is good enough to tinker with the Sex Discrimination Act in this instance, it sets a precedent. This government can ill afford a precedent in this area. Over the last 12 months there have been too many occasions when the government has not maintained its commitment in regard to equal opportunity and gender issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to put on the record the view of the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Chris Sidoti, who said the commission has major concerns with the amendments proposed in schedule 3. Schedule 3 represents a significant withdrawal from the lawful commitment made by Australia in the ratification of the convention on the elimination of all forms of sex discrimination, as implemented through the Sex Discrimination Act. The first part of schedule 3 proposes the insertion of a section in the Migration Act. The insertion of this section would permit differentiation between applicants for immigration on the basis of de facto or de jure relationships, according to the law's status. The commission is most concerned that the introduction of this kind of discrimination represents a significant retreat from the commitment made in the enactment of the Sex Discrimination Act that there should be no discrimination on the basis of marital status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian law has dealt for some time with the criteria for the acceptance of the existence of a genuine de facto  relationship. Those criteria have been spelt out most particularly in social security law. They have also been enacted in the past and developed in relation to immigration law. As a non&hyphen;lawyer, I do not know whether this criteria will be challenged at some stage. The immigration department has had to contend with a number of challenges over the years. Whether or not this could 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be challenged is something that we will have to wait and see, I suppose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the Human Rights Commissioner. The Australian section of the International Commission of Jurists also commented saying that the Sex Discrimination Act is a piece of fundamental human rights legislation. By admitting the need for a piece of legislation to be exempted from the operation of a law, such as the Sex Discrimination Act, the government is admitting the legislation it proposes is discriminatory and breaches Australia's international undertakings. The Australian section of the International Commission of Jurists sees no reason why this should be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, indeed, it is the policy of the government to resile generally from the principles contained in the Sex Discrimination Act, then it should openly announce such a policy and seek to amend the act generally. I do not even want to suggest that option. I am too concerned that it could in fact be somewhere on the government's agenda. Senator Cooney, in his usual way, was very generous in his comments and said that probably the government had the best of intentions in setting this requirement for two years. Of course it has been renegotiated to a one&hyphen;year cohabitation period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having worked as minister assisting in the areas of both the status of women and immigration, I would concede that the department of immigration has always tried to assist women in relationships to ensure that those relationships are genuine, that those relationships will be particularly in the woman's best interest. I am looking at a number of fairly controversial discussions that have been taking place over a number of years now in relation to Filipino relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The goal of the immigration department was to give women every opportunity to ensure that the relationship was as it seemed and was not going to result in the woman regretting that she had made such a choice. So there are some reasons for setting a period. It used to be six months. I understand it was not legally binding. It was simply that the department set that as a period to be demonstrated as the cohabitation period. Senator 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1118"> Stott Despoja said that she was concerned about violent relationships. There can be a need for certain protective measures in this regard. So I can accept some of Senator Cooney's comments about best intentions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if we have been operating for a number of years with a six-month period seen as mandatory, why change? Why do we have to enshrine it in legislation, particularly when it means going against the provisions of the sex discrimination legislation? I know that we have an indication from the minister that it will be closely monitored. There will be exemptions but it is the principle of changing the compliance of the migration legislation with the sex discrimination legislation that sets a precedent. I think that is a very risky precedent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On perhaps a lighter note, it interesting to note the double standards that apply when we talk about family reunion as distinct from business migration. We seem to be at pains to set a period of time in which the spouse can indicate a stable relationship but we do not do that for business, do we? We do not have any period of time in which business has to indicate that it is in fact a stable reputable business. We do not have a two&hyphen;year period. I see an officer is nodding. I would be interested at a later stage in this debate to compare how we treat family reunions with how we treat business. It seems to me that some pretty creative business practices can get past and those practices will continue in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not adopt the same standards of ensuring stability in the business community as we are insisting on in terms of establishing appropriate relationships. Also the obvious double standard is that if we did that domestically, if one had to prove stability in a relationship to proceed in any number of areas domestically, would it not be interesting? I did want to put on the record my concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that Senator Newman now has a parliamentary advisory committee looking at how Australian women get their message through. I would like to recommend to Senator Newman that she take a close look at the processes of this government in terms of how the Office of the Status of Women is able to report on the impact of government decision 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> making on women. The Office of the Status of Women is very poorly resourced at the moment. It is understaffed and has recently lost its senior officer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that this particular amendment bill, and I am speaking specifically of schedule 3, seems to have got past. It certainly cannot have had any input from the Office of the Status of Women. I cannot believe that the Office of the Status of Women would have recommended setting aside the fundamental principles of the Sex Discrimination Act. If that is the case, I would certainly like to see the evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever agreements have been negotiated&mdash;and when you are in opposition you do have to negotiate and get the best of a bad situation&mdash;I think the fundamental principle of tinkering with the Sex Discrimination Act, setting aside the Sex Discrimination Act, is like what is being recommended in relation to race discrimination in the government's response to the Wik decision. It sets a very bad precedent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In considering this bill, we should keep that very much to the fore. Whatever inevitably goes through this chamber, we must insist that community, government and the opposition monitor the impact to ensure that there is not the kind of discrimination that the Sex Discrimination Act is there to protect us from.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few remarks in relation to some of the comments that have been made, particularly in the area of schedule 2 and in relation to the mechanisms by which it is proposed in these migration bills that the government could deal with migrants in certain categories, most particularly aged parents and spouses. These bills set out to create a more flexible regime for dealing with applications than is currently available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a mechanism&mdash;there has been for a long time&mdash;by which it is possible to cap the number of migrants in particular categories. That is known as the cap and terminate mechanism. For the benefit of honourable senators, let me explain how that works. Where a cap has been set in a particular category, when that cap is reached all applica 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1119"> tions are terminated. That means that those applications have to be made again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is within the discretion of the minister under the cap and terminate procedure to choose to refund the application money, but the minister is not obliged to refund the application money. I think it would be very peculiar if a minister chose not to refund the application money, but there may be particular circumstances where that would be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The essence of the cap and terminate mechanism is that the application is dead. What we are seeking to do in this bill is to introduce cap and queue mechanisms. The difference between cap and queue and cap and terminate is simply this: under cap and queue, applications which are not accepted because the cap has been reached get carried over into the following year and they get dealt with at the top of the queue in the following year. That means that a person who meets the criteria but fails to get accepted or fails to get the visa issued because the cap has already been reached keeps their place in the queue relative to people who apply in the following year. That is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the cap and terminate mechanism, there is no guarantee that somebody who meets the criteria but fails because the cap has already been reached will be dealt with at the top of the queue in the next year. It may well be that there is a flood of people at the beginning of the next financial year and that flood of people ensures that the bona fide applicant who failed to get accepted because of the cap the previous year does not get accepted in the second year. That is the danger of the cap and terminate mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government is seeking to do in schedule 2 is quite simply say, `We want a mechanism that is simpler and we want a mechanism that is fairer to the applicant.' There is the possibility that schedule 2 may be deleted by amendment during the committee stage. I am merely rising at this point in time to say to honourable senators who have some concerns about capping generally that this is not the place to address those concerns. The cap and terminate mechanism is already in place. It was in place during the life of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> previous government. So I say to those who have an argument about capping: this is not the place to have the argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who want to ensure fairness for applicants and want to ensure a system that recognises that people who fail to get in simply because of the cap in one year should be given some priority of assessment the following year must support schedule 2 as it exists in this bill. A failure to support schedule 2 will mean that the government will be forced very reluctantly to utilise the cap and terminate mechanism if applications in certain categories exceed the target. The government does not want to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is not, in so far as schedule 2 is concerned, a sign of an authoritarian, dictatorial or harsh government. Schedule 2 is part of a commitment by this government to make the mechanisms for dealing with migration applications fairer, simpler and more reasonable. It would be an enormous shame if the Senate, to make some sort of other ideological point, were to knock back a more reasonable, flexible and fairer system as is proposed in schedule 2 of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know as I speak that there are honourable senators from a number of parties who are undecided as to how schedule 2 should be dealt with. It has been suggested by the opposition that schedule 2 should be deleted in its entirety. I am rising at this late point in the debate to argue as forcefully as I can that honourable senators wanting to see a fair processing of applications should support schedule 2 as it stands or at least support schedule 2 in part if they believe that parts of it should be dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I firmly believe that, if any honourable senator believes that the cap and queue mechanism should apply to, for example, aged parents, then that logic also flows through that it should also apply to spouses. It would be wrong to suggest that a fair mechanism should apply in one category and not in another. Acceptance of it in one category means that you should accept the principle in the other categories for which schedule 2 seeks application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I beg honourable senators who are undecided as to how they will vote 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1120"> on schedule 2 to consider, between now and the vote in the committee stage, the fact that voting against schedule 2 makes the system more harsh, and that this bill is part of a package of reform aimed at making the system less harsh and more flexible. For that reason, I beg honourable senators to support the bill and schedule 2 as it stands.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their consideration of this package of legislation. In particular, I thank Senators Stott Despoja, Bolkus, Brown, Cooney, McKiernan, Reynolds and O'Chee for their contributions to this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The package of bills now before the chamber is designed to achieve several important policy initiatives which were outlined in the second reading speeches. Senator Kemp, in a statement to the Senate on behalf of the government, announced how we intend to pursue regulations relating to the cohabitation requirement for de factos, and the English education charge. There is no need to repeat those statements here, other than to note Senator Bolkus's advice that the opposition will support schedules 1, vis-a-vis visa charges, and 3, vis-a-vis the cohabitation requirement, of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) on the basis of those understandings and explanations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also advised that the opposition will be supporting schedule 4, vis-a-vis deprivation of citizenship, subject to clarification about the issue of statelessness. I will come to that issue later, and I certainly can reassure Senator Bolkus on that matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would make particular reference to the measures contained in the No. 3 bill relating to placing limits on visas. The government is determined to restore balance in the migration program in 1996-97 and future years. We are doing this through an integrated, sensible and reasonable range of measures which include placing limits on the number of visas which may be issued in some categories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the capping amendments which are before the Senate is to enable government to manage all parts of the migration program in a manner that would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minimise inconvenience to applicants and reduce costs and inefficiencies. I note that Senator Stott Despoja has indicated that the Democrats will be supporting all these measures, which are contained in schedule 2 of the bill. I welcome that support and trust it will be forthcoming, particularly given the policy commitments of the Democrats to lower migration levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government obviously will be opposing the opposition's amendment which would omit schedule 2. As senators would be aware, the bill itself does not seek to specify the actual limits on the number of visas issued to spouses, dependent children or aged parents in any one year. In fact, the government can already use the existing cap and terminate provisions of the act in respect of spouses, dependent children and aged parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, use of these powers means that, once a cap is reached, all outstanding applications are taken not to have been made. This means that affected applicants must be contacted, advised of the impact of the decision and refunded their fees. If those applicants still wish to continue to seek to migrate to Australia, they will have to reapply in the new year with a new form and a new application fee. Consideration of their applications would then start afresh.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock, has made it plain that in future if he must use the existing cap and terminate powers to deliver a balanced migration program he will do so. What this bill seeks to do is to ensure that, if there are insufficient places compared to demand, the length of time applicants have to wait for a visa and any inconvenience associated with the process are minimised. The amendments would enable the government to establish an orderly queue for migration to Australia in all migration classes such that inconvenience to applicants would be minimised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator O'Chee says, it is a fairer system. Under the arrangements we propose, once a cap is reached, processing would continue, and those applicants who reach visa grant stage would be queued for visa grant in the next program 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1121"> year when places become available. The length of time that applicants wait may be only a few weeks, depending on demand and the number of places that become available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the provisions in schedule 4 of the bill relating to Australian citizenship, I note that some concerns have been raised regarding statelessness. I wish to emphasise to honourable senators that the power to deprive a person of Australian citizenship is a discretionary power which may only be exercised if it would be contrary to the public interest for the person to remain a citizen. Honourable senators are assured that statelessness is one factor that will continue to be taken into account in exercising the discretion of whether or not to deprive a person of Australian citizenship. The power is therefore exercised sparingly and only in appropriate cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can also inform the Senate that the government has been advised that the provisions of schedule 4 are not contrary to Australia's obligations at international law. Indeed, the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness provides that a person may be deprived of a nationality which was obtained by misrepresentation or fraud. I thank all senators for their contributions to this debate.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">There are quite a few points that I want to make with respect to these amendments. I think I had better put these on the record quickly. As I have said, the package of bills was designed to achieve several important policy initiatives. They have already been outlined. The government has decided not to proceed at this time with its planned changes to the existing English education charge. The government has also decided to address concerns raised by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in relation to aspects of the proposed exemption of the Sex Discrimination Act. As a result of these decisions, the government is now moving three amendments, of which we are dealing with the first two. We will not be proceeding with the Immigration (Education) Charge Amendment Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to bring to the attention of honourable senators my only discrepancy between the order of the amendments and the order in which they appear in the supplementary explanatory memorandum. This discrepancy only became apparent after the explanatory memorandum had been printed and lodged with the Table Office. The first amendment&mdash;that is, item 3 in the explanatory memorandum&mdash;changes the long title of this bill. This is consequential to the second amendment and is purely technical in nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second amendment&mdash;that is, item 1 in the explanatory memorandum&mdash;concerns the mechanism for introducing the proposed visa application charge. The Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill 1996 introduces a single visa application charge to replace the existing complicated system of visa application fees, the health services charge and the English education charge. This new charge will include a component equivalent to the current English education charge, a charge which is only paid by some migrants who do not have functional English. Payment of this charge entitles a person to up to 510 hours of English language tuition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under existing legislation and subject to an indexation formula, the maximum amount of English education charge is $4,405, a figure 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which is well short of the current full cost recovery figure of $5,500. The government announced in the 1996-97 budget that it would move to amend the Immigration (Education) Charge Act 1992 to increase the ceiling for the maximum of the charge payable under the regulations to $5,500. At the same time the government moved to amend the regulations to remove concessional rates of charge that were payable by some migrants. Those regulations were disallowed by the Senate on 7 November 1996. It is apparent therefore that a majority of senators do not currently support increased charges for English language tuition or the removal of concessional rates. Accordingly, the government has decided at this time not to pursue the proposed increases in English education charge, even though this creates a greater burden on the Australian taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the action now proposed by the government, the amount of the English education charge will remain at the same level as at 1 January this year, subject to any changes flowing from the indexation procedure that has been in place for some years. In view of this, the government will not now be proceeding with the Immigration (Education) Charge Amendment Bill. This means that visa applications that are made before the commencement of the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill will be subject to the existing legislative provisions for calculation of the English education charge. Visa applications that are made after commencement of the visa application charge will, of course, be subject to a new charge instead of the existing charges. The new charge will contain a component that is based on lack of English language proficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with the government's decision not to increase the English education charge above current levels at this stage, the component of the visa application charge that corresponds to the English education charge will be set by regulation at the same level as applied at 1 January this year. That will also include maintaining the concessions that applied on that date. The amendments proposed by the government ensure that people who apply for permanent visas after the introduction of the visa application charge will only pay the new 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1123"> charge and that people who are already liable to pay the existing English education charge will not have to pay the visa application charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two items in the second amendment are identical to items 1 and 2 of the schedule to the Immigration (Education) Charge Amendment Bill, the bill we are not now proceeding with. These items are largely technical in nature and are designed to prevent the possibility of double liability for both the English education charge and the visa application charge. No-one who has made a valid visa application within the meaning of the Migration Act before the commencement of the visa application charge will have to pay a visa application charge and no-one who makes a valid visa application after that date will be liable for the English education charge.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bolkus, I am advised that the term `immediate family member' generally means spouse or dependent child. You can see that this definition quite markedly extends that meaning quite dramatically from spouse and dependent children to include an adult child, parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling and so on. So you are quite right. This definition is at odds with the general definitions in the bill.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The principle is one that the opposition has always supported in order to exclude refugees and humanitarian entrants from some of these changes that the government has proposed. Given that the amendments are at a late stage and there are those questions of definition of `family member' and so on, we would rather continue with the situation where the parliament has capacity to reject any such fees, if and when the government chooses to bowl them up, rather than to be prescriptive at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is probably something we can look at in terms of future legislation. It is something we need to have a close look at because the issue of the definition of `immediate family members' is not an easy one. It does change from background to background, culture to culture.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the consequences are foreseeable in that they are wholly good as far as we are concerned. Senator Bolkus has said that we can deal with this maybe by looking at government regulations further down the line. The problem there is that we cannot regulate. I can amend the legislation here and now, but I cannot regulate later down the line to add to or change the import of the legislation. So this is the one chance the Greens have of giving the definition we have, to include within the ambit of `immediate family 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> members' those persons who have been outlined, including grandparents and siblings, for goodness' sake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they are not immediate family, who is? If that is not in the definition of immediate family, the words `immediate family' need changing or the definition needs changing. It seems that it is so proscriptive that it belies the term `immediate family' if these people are not included. One should stick to the term `spouse or child' if that is all that one means by immediate family, because grandparent, grandchild and siblings are commonly thought of as immediate family. They are immediate in every sense of the word of relationship as far as the public is concerned. However, that being the case, I can see that we are not going to get support from the major parties on this matter. I am glad that I brought it up because it was an effort to weight things a little bit in the opposite direction from the one which the government is taking overall with immigration policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing now with the opposition's proposal that schedule 2 be opposed. The opposition has some very strong views about this particular proposal put by the government. These views relate to what could probably best be described as two particular points. First of all, the overall impact of schedule 2 will be to enable the minister&mdash;not by regulation and in no way accountable to the parliament but by a notice in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> &mdash;to have the unfettered power to cap and kill off applications in those areas of close family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking here of spouse, dependent child and aged parent visas. It is important for us that any power that is exercised in this area is one that is exercised under the scrutiny of the parliament and with accountability to it. It is also important for us to ensure that families are not kept separate because of an arbitrary unaccountable exercise of power by way of gazette by government ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, the opposition was prepared to enter into an arrangement with the government to allow the government to be able to cap and queue in respect of aged 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1125"> parents. We had introduced a number of measures in government to try to get the balance right in respect of aged parents. We could see that the government was insistent on trying to reduce the number of entrants in the family program and we were prepared to contemplate capping and queuing in respect of aged parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, I am informed, was prepared to contemplate dropping off their proposals in this area as they affected spouses and dependent children. I think that would have been a fair outcome in the circumstances, although one in principle that would have still caused problems in respect of aged parents. That was the proposal that was around the place, one that in a sense was agreeable to the government. But I am told that the government is not agreeing to that and now it wants to test this particular proposal over schedule 2 on the floor of the Senate. I am further advised that, if in fact schedule 2 does not survive in this place, the government will look at further proposals in the House of Representatives which would, in effect, reflect the spirit of the discussions that have been taking place between the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock, and the opposition spokesperson, Duncan Kerr.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is indulging in a bit of a try&hyphen;on here. For the government to ask for a power to actually act in this area in a way that involves no accountability at all to the Senate and in a way that would allow the minister to make a decision here to cap and kill by an announcement by notice in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> is something that we should not be in the business of agreeing to. That would be the impact of the amendments in respect of the proposed section 39.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also, of course, have problems in respect of keeping families separate. The proposals here would give a minister a capacity to keep children from parents and to keep one spouse away from another. Those sorts of interventions by government are totally unsavoury and unhelpful and should not be supported by the parliament. If anything is going to bring the migration program into disrepute, it will be a continuation of the flow 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of cases&mdash;day after day and week after week in the media&mdash;of kids who cannot join their parents, or of spouses who cannot join the other spouse. That sort of procession will drag the law into disrepute because that sort of procession is indefensible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot defend keeping parents separate. The direct impact of these proposals will be that, for instance, some 1,500 spouses a year would be kept separate from their spouse living in Australia and a large number of young children would also be kept separate. In terms of fiancees that would be separated, we are talking of 1,300 offshore, 670 offshore preferential family. In terms of dependants, we are talking about 210 dependent children who would be kept separate from their parents. We are not talking about big numbers here. Let us face it: we are talking about, in the whole scheme of things, something like two or three per cent of the migration program. For a government to be proposing such draconian legislation to fix up something which only needs tinkering with at the edges is something that the opposition cannot support. So the opposition will oppose schedule 2.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Vanstone, the Democrats will not be supporting schedule 2 in its current form. We were under the impression that a negotiated settlement&mdash;the one that Senator Bolkus referred to&mdash;had been reached between the shadow minister and the minister on this issue. I said in the second reading debate that, if the government chose a path that was oppressive or harsh or discriminatory, we would seek to monitor it closely but we would not, as I said in my speech last week, be supporting such wide discretionary powers in relation to the family reunion category.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So our indication of support for schedule 2 was that a discussion had taken place between the opposition and the government and that a least worst arrangement had been arrived at in relation to the intake of aged parents in the family reunion category. I am sorry that so-called negotiated position has fallen through, because it was a position that the Democrats indicated that they were prepared to support. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1126"> Obviously, as there are no amendments before us in this regard&mdash;and I have had it confirmed from advisers on both sides&mdash;there will be no qualification to schedule 2. We felt that the negotiated settlement had, in fact, alleviated some of the harsher measures of the bill. In line with our policy, though, we were still very strongly in favour of family reunions or at least allowing spouses and children&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I6">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, we are not discussing numbers. We are talking about how we determine who is coming into the country. I say again that the Democrat policy is not inconsistent in this regard. We recognise, and our policy recognises, a need for a population policy. We also, in relation to immigration, acknowledge that a reduced immigration intake is not an unreasonable policy suggestion. But how we determine those people who come into this country and how they are treated once they are here are matters that are yet to be debated in a fair and appropriate way by this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats reiterate that we acknowledge that spouses and other people eligible under family reunions, such as children and even aged parents, have a valuable role to play in our society. We believe they value add to our society. We reiterate that we are not in favour of some kind of social engineering in relation to inter&hyphen;reunion and immigration intake in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's objective that has been touted in relation to schedule 2 is to provide more flexibility and so-called fairness in relation to the system. What I can see from the broad ranging nature of schedule 2 is that it simply offers the minister wide discretionary and unfettered powers, certainly with uncertain scrutiny arrangements. For that reason, all of my colleagues have expressed their concerns regarding the wide discretionary powers that this particular schedule gives the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleagues have listened to the debate and have given consideration to the arguments proffered on all sides of the chamber and have decided that the issues are significantly 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more complex, particularly as they relate to unfettered power for the minister and in many ways abrogate the supervisory role of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the issue of capping and queuing, as opposed to capping and killing, we had some sympathy for the government attempts to try to provide a more compassionate system. But we find that schedule 2 in its current form is too harsh and too oppressive and will not be supported in that form. I again lament the fact that the government apparently is no longer supporting a settlement. I am happy to be corrected on this if there is a different story as to why this has fallen through. Again, we were prepared to support that negotiated settlement at least as one way of alleviating the harshness of schedule 2 in its original form. The Democrats will not support it in its current form. However, we were prepared to support it with the changes to aged parents.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not delay the Senate on this matter.

She was not, as I understand it, told that by the government. In fact, that came from discussions that other non-government parties might have had. This really does not seem any way to run the show.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, I want to talk briefly on this and indicate that this amendment will have the effect of entirely negating our proposals to have a visa cap and queue extended to those areas where it is currently unavailable; that is, to aged parent visas, to spouse visas and to dependent children visas. We obviously oppose the amendment. We believe the measures are essential for orderly management of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to understand that the previous government had, and this government has, cap and kill mechanisms already.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cooney, this amendment basically implements an election commitment. As you know, it relates to schedule 3 of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) and addresses concerns raised by the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in relation to aspects of the proposed exemption. The committee recommended that proposed section 507(b) of the migration legislation be redrafted to limit the field of operation of the provision. The committee's concern was that administrative practices could be authorised under section 507, with the effect of allowing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> discrimination to occur in relation to the marital status of persons dealing with visa applications from persons in de facto relationships.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government wants to make it clear that we could never contemplate this. However, we are prepared to move an amendment to put the issue beyond doubt. The third amendment, therefore, directly addresses the committee's concern by putting beyond doubt that the Sex Discrimination Act continues to apply in relation to the marital status of persons making or administering the relevant regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the explanatory memorandum has been amended to make it absolutely clear that the Sex Discrimination Act applies except to the extent required to administer those regulations. As the government indicated in the statement foreshadowing this amendment, another area of consideration has been the government's intention to require a mandatory period of cohabitation for people seeking visas on the basis of de facto and interdependent relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable senators can be assured that the government intends that the period of cohabitation that will be required under the regulations in de facto and interdependency cases will not exceed 12 months and that there will be provision to waive this requirement if there are compelling circumstances to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example&mdash;and without intending to be prescriptive about the content of future regulations&mdash;the regulations might make provision for waiver of the cohabitation period where a de facto couple has a child of the relationship or where cohabitation by interdependent applicants is contrary to the law of the country in which they reside. In conclusion, the government moves these amendments with some reluctance. As a matter of principle, we are committed to the user&hyphen;pays principle.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister might just clarify something for me. She said that there is no concern about the Sex Discrimination Act. I thought the changes the government was making were, on the face of it, infringing the Sex Discrimination Act&mdash;that is, that de facto couples are going to be treated differently from married

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is where I take umbrage at the legislation. No doubt the statistics can fly, but if you want to make an analysis of married couples under the headings of couples with one, two, three, four, five children or no children, their age groups or where they got married, you will find there are different statistics as to how long those marriages last.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's notes say that it wants to make it harder for de facto couples to come to this country because their rate of staying together is not as good as it is for people who have a marriage certificate under their arm. But that is discriminatory. The minister should be able to say why it is that she has not broken down into subgroups the biggest group in this category coming into the country, married people, to see which sorts of marriages will last the best and apply the two-year test to the sorts of marriages which do not last as well as others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of the Sex Discrimination Act was to stop this sort of thing happening. The point of this amendment is to allow the government to get around an act which has been on our statutes for 13 years to prevent discrimination. As we all know, once we allow a bit to be chipped away, the government will be back to have more chipped away further down the line. So, as far as I am concerned, I oppose this move by the government. I think it is fraught with difficulties.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's position has evolved through discussions with the government, and I must say it has been made a lot easier because of the government's preparedness to cut back the period from two years to one and also to invest a discretion in the minister or delegated officer to waive such a requirement in circumstances where, for instance, a country's laws prohibit such cohabitation. That was one of the concerns raised before the Senate committee and reflected in the report of the committee on this bill. So those two measures make it somewhat easier for us to accept a measure which, in principle, we would have enormous difficulty in accepting.</PARA></SPEECH>

The amendment&mdash;and I apologise for its late circulation&mdash;is one which government and opposition members would be familiar with anyway, given it has been moved in a rather similar form in relation to bills in previous debates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not support amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act, and we are proposing an amendment which essentially affirms the primacy of the SDA as it presently exists. Just as Senator Reynolds objected strongly to any attempts to tone down the SDA, we are making a commitment to that in amendment form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We certainly believe in equality, and on at least five separate occasions our national parliament has spoken in favour of equality.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that exemptions do not further human rights in this country but are political 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> compromises which often have the effect of allowing safe havens for some people to discriminate against other people. The Australian Democrats strongly believe that racial, sexual and disability discrimination are equally abhorrent and should be given equal weighting and equal concern. So I have moved an amendment which is a modified version of what the ALP moved in relation to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996&mdash;I believe that was accepted by the government&mdash;and in relation to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996.</PARA>

The implications are such, though, that one has to consider the whole diversity of migration law, and that is something that worries us at this particular stage. The principle is a good one. But, for instance, how does it affect married couples and how does it affect de facto couples in so many areas of migration law? That is not before us at the moment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone made a telling point. Having passed what we just did in terms of the SDA, how do we then pass this at this particular stage? That is something we really need to dwell on. I would like to see, though, the government give full consideration to the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act in relation to migration law. It is something that over recent years we did pay some attention to. But we think it would be quite useful to have a review into the migration law and its consistency with the SDA. That could be done, for instance, by the joint committee of the parliament on migration or maybe the Sex Discrimination Commissioner could be asked to look at this area. But it is an important issue and one which is diverse in its ramifications. For that reason, not having had a chance to test those ramifications at this stage, we are not inclined to support the amendment, though we support the principle.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a really dangerous point of view to take. What we know from the passing of the last amendment is that the authority of the Sex Discrimination Act is being put secondary to the government's intentions in this legislation. The minister knows that. She just said that, having passed that amendment five minutes ago, you would be a dill if you now supported this. The opposition needs to look further than that because, if it does not support this, it is effectively saying that it is putting the Sex Discrimination Act second to the government's new policy of limiting immigration and categories of people who can come to the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate: it is a very dangerous precedent to be allowing the government to get away with. That is why I spoke so strongly against 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the last amendment. That is why I spoke so strongly against the committee allowing the government to get away with writing into legislation that the Sex Discrimination Act will come second. I had thought that that was one of the flagships, if you like, of Labor's social justice innovations of the last decade or two. For goodness sake, let us not hear the Labor Party saying, `But here's an exception.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, Senator Stott Despoja has come forward with a very clear defence of the Sex Discrimination Act in this legislation. She has pointed to the fact that she is being incited to do this, if you like, by the fact that in the last few weeks Labor has been defending through this same mechanism other acts which protect our citizens from discrimination. So how could Labor not support this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot get away with saying, `We haven't had time to look at it.' Let us move to give you more time, if that is the case. But I appeal to the Labor Party to look at this amendment again. It is a very important principle and the government should not get away with pulling the first strings to undo the Sex Discrimination Act lightly. It is a very important matter. Those of us who are concerned, and I think everybody in this place is concerned about discrimination, ought to look to the legislation that this parliament has passed&mdash;very often hard fought for and hard won&mdash;and not take it lightly at all. To say, `We haven't had time to look at this,' is to fail to give it the seriousness that it ought to have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe I should not reflect on past votes&mdash;I do not know what the rule is&mdash;but we ought not in this place be passing specific infringements of the Sex Discrimination Act. The committee did that in a way. Here is our chance to recover. Here is our chance to make good that last vote if we, in consideration, do not think it was a good one. Making it legal to infringe the Sex Discrimination Act is not much different from infringing it in an illegal fashion. We have the opportunity here to think about it and we ought to be supporting Senator Stott Despoja's motion. It is clear cut, it is simple and it says, `Let's stand by the Sex Discrimination Act.'

So let us not pretend that parliament is doing something now that it has not understood and that it has not been considered by a whole range of people. It has and they agree. They might disagree with you, but other people nonetheless have a different view. That may be difficult to accept, but the longer we are here the more we all have to swallow it every now and then.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A framework was established whereby the states and  territories were responsible for primary accreditation of institutions and courses while the Commonwealth maintained a register of providers and their courses. It required non&hyphen;exempt providers to operate trust accounts for prepaid course fees; to submit to the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, as it then was, an annual return relating to the operation of these trust accounts; and to be members of a tuition assurance scheme. There seems no doubt that these arrangements have contributed significantly to the stability in the industry in the period since their introduction and have been a major factor in the growth of the industry during that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In view of the fact that the ESOS Act was due to expire at the end of this year, a review 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of it was undertaken earlier this year by Ernst and Young. In a climate of general deregulation it is interesting to note that the review found no stakeholder in favour of industry self&hyphen;regulation at this time. Concerns centred on Australia's international reputation in the provision of education services and whether the industry currently had sufficient maturity to self&hyphen;regulate. In addition, there was a stakeholder agreement that the Commonwealth should continue to have a regulatory role and that regulation entirely by state and territory governments was not desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sunset clause in the ESOS Act will now take effect from 1 January 1999. Given that there seems to be a genuine agreement about the appropriateness of the current arrangements and that it is vitally important that we ensure that such a very substantial export industry is protected by effective financial and quality safeguards, the opposition believes that it is not unreasonable for the Commonwealth to seek to recoup some of the costs incurred in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government proposed that a charge be levied on the basis of the number of students enrolled by institutions in the previous year, with the charge amounts ranging from $300 for up to 10 students, increasing to $5,000 for more than 400 students. The charge would apply for all enrolments of people in Australia on student visas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that Senator Margetts had planned to move two amendments to take account of the length of courses as well as the number of enrolments at each institution. This is quite important, given the vast differences in course length&mdash;they vary from a period of weeks to years. It was Labor's initiative that encouraged the government to reconsider their approach to these regulations and as a result this has led to a discussion between various parties within the Senate. The way the legislation was previously framed discriminated against the providers of shorter courses many of whom are members of the English Language Intensive Courses to Overseas Students Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the information supplied by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the median 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1134"> course duration of students enrolled at ELICOS institutions in 1995 was 40 weeks. In other words, around half the students were enrolled in courses shorter than 40 weeks. Also according to DEETYA, around 20 per cent of ELICOS enrolments were people doing courses of less than three months duration who could therefore have been eligible for visitor rather than student visas, thus excluding them from the calculation of the provider registration charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That means, however, that 80 per cent of enrolments were not eligible for such exclusion, yet many were still doing relatively short courses. To take account of this and to try to treat such providers on an equitable basis with other providers such as universities, we are pleased to note that the government listened to the concerns put forward by the opposition parties and has sought to amend its bill in a way which counts people doing courses of less than 26 weeks as half an enrolment for the purpose of the charge, with students in longer courses counting as one enrolment. We will therefore be supporting this amendment. I note that the minister has yet to arrive.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to discuss the education services for overseas student bills, both the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Bill 1996 and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ESOS act, as many of us are aware, allows for the regulation of the overseas education industry in this country. Many will recall that this arose from a situation in 1991 where the government was forced to refund the fees of 12,000 international students affected by the closure of private educational services in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ESOS also provides for quality and fairness within the industry. These bills establish the administrative arrangements required of providers under the ESOS act. These bills also extend the sunset clause for a further two years while consultation continues with industry regarding service provision for international students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One million dollars per annum of the estimated $1.9 billion in export revenue is expected to result from the passage of these bills. I note that an article appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> last year&mdash;I think it coincided with the original timetabling of this legislation, when we were first due to debate it&mdash;in the higher education supplement entitled `Education top in export growth'. In that article I learnt that Steven Kemp had conducted the research for a report which found that more export dollars come into this country from overseas higher education than from wheat. I believe the figure stated was around $1.9 billion this year alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is obviously an incredibly huge industry. It is little wonder that people involved in that industry as well as people involved in the higher education sector generally were very concerned about the impact, both economically and academically, of comments made last year by a certain Independent member in the other place and were very worried that export education and its expected revenue might be somehow harmed in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between 1988 and 1995, the number of overseas students in Australia increased nearly fourfold to more than 800,000. Mr Kemp also observed this and further observed that universities were increasingly nervous that their funding would become more dependent upon overseas student income. As a result of his 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1135"> research, he says, `If there were to be any abrupt changes in policy or fall off in student numbers, they would really feel it'&mdash;`they' being the higher education institutions, which are increasingly reliant on independent fees and charges these days that they secure not only from overseas students but also from domestic students in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To date Australia has captured a larger market share than either the US or the UK, but this could change obviously if there are detrimental or negative changes policywise in this country but also if they realise&mdash;and I am sure they do&mdash;the potential export earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Australia should not lose the hard work put in by universities. There has been a lot of effort put in by institutions around this country over the last decade, certainly in regard to providing bridging courses, orientation courses or what have you for overseas students. Certainly that should not be sacrificed for the sake of short-term measures, be those measures to slash and burn or what have you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each international student is estimated to spend around $23,000 per annum in education on a range of expenses&mdash;obviously living expenses as well as education expenses. In 1995, there was $1.88 billion in direct expenditure by international students&mdash;a huge amount&mdash;and, I believe, $125 million generated by other education export earnings from offshore programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Steven Kemp said that the only limitation to this growth is the potential of the higher education sector to cope. That brings into debate a whole range of issues regarding changes and reform in the higher education sector generally. Obviously, the impact of budget cuts to operating grants, cuts to discretionary funding arrangements and the resultant cuts to programs, schools, departments, staff and resources have seen the first dominoes fall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note&mdash;and many in this chamber would be aware of this&mdash;that international students have been calling meetings. They have been concerned and they have spoken with vice-chancellors. This has been reported in the media which has filtered through&mdash;not only in domestic papers around this country and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the mainstream press, but media in different countries. It is a simple premise: if you cut resources to a university system which is already feeling the strain of 13 years of chronic underfunding, you will undermine the quality of the sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind honourable senators that we have seen the closure of campuses already in this nation: the St George campus of the University of New South Wales and the Salisbury campus of the University of South Australia in our home state, Madam Acting Deputy President. We had news only last week that that same institution is considering closing the doors of its regional campus in Whyalla, obviously in the face of the harsh budget cuts that have been undertaken by this coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen other universities merging their departments. They have retrenched staff, and I am sure they will continue to do so. Of course we are all familiar with the up-front fees proposals that have been rammed through by this government. The University of Melbourne is considering $110,000 for a dentistry degree. All of these will impact upon the quality offered in institutions. The quality and the reputation of these institutions will determine whether or not they can attract overseas students and overseas student dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has cut universities by 4.9 per cent over the next three years. These cuts are compounded by a failure to maintain an election pledge by this government&mdash;that is, to address the NTEU wage claim. Basically, this means that the cuts to the higher education sector, to universities specifically, are around 10 per cent. If the resources and budgets are already strained and the government continues to cut further, then the reality is that international students will look to other places. They will look to countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom to pursue their study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Around this country we are losing academics with expertise in many fields. Once they have gone, their experience will no longer be available to the minds of future, up and coming students. The university funding cuts in this nation are as short-sighted in an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1136"> economic as well as academic sense as they are unpopular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This weekend the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> printed the results of an AGB McNair poll which failed the performance of the Howard government on higher education. Forty&hyphen;six per cent of those surveyed disapproved of the coalition's treatment of higher education. But I am sure that many of us on this side of the chamber could have told&mdash;indeed, have told&mdash;the government that, as every debate regarding higher education has come to this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that this was the highest disapproval rating of the entire survey. It probably reflects similar surveys which have been conducted recently showing that the minister's performance is considered I think the bottom or the equal bottom rating with that of Alexander Downer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, when it comes to the public's perception of performance of ministers in this country. It is worth noting also that that approval rating, which did rate Senator Vanstone more highly than Mr Downer, was taken before the means test debacle&mdash;and I am sure that Mr Downer is taking comfort from that but certainly minister Vanstone is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly the electorate could have expected to be able to put some faith or hope in the government holding true to some of its policies&mdash;certainly its pre-election promises that it would not cut funds to this particular sector, that it would not cut operating grants, that it would maintain Austudy, that it would not change fees and charges and that it would strengthen rural and regional institutions. I would be very interested to see the overseas student take&hyphen;up rate in regional and remote campuses around this nation, especially when many of those campuses are facing the threat of closure. The population had a right to believe that they would not be facing up-front fees and charges of the magnitude they now expect, just as they believed that this government really did have a commitment to education, as stated in its pre-election policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is a litany of broken promises from this government in regard to higher education funding. International students also 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have the right to believe that, once they enrol in an Australian university, they will receive a quality education; that the government will ensure that, within those universities, the buildings are not falling down, the libraries are well stocked and there are sufficient staff, resources and infrastructure; that the computers will be adequate for the number of students in those institutions; and that the campus environment will be a safe one. Students who come to these shores, who pay up-front fees&mdash;full cost fees, in many cases&mdash;have a right to expect such arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet many international students, overseas students&mdash;not just their formal organisation&mdash;have been contacting my office with complaints about the animosity they receive when referring to administrators, be they vice&hyphen;chancellors, registrars or what have you, when they bring up issues such as a shortage of resources, and so on. Ultimately, any shortage of resources is the responsibility of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has been particularly quick to slash education budgets and boast of its budget cuts but very slow to recognise that education is not a cost. Education in this country is an investment, an investment in our future. Also, economically speaking, it is a good investment. When we talk about the revenue from export education creating more money in this country than wheat, then obviously that investment is giving a very quick return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funding cuts in many institutions will rebound on overseas students. It seems that many institutions will be forced to make tough decisions as a result of the budget cuts. Those tough decisions include offering no counselling; cutting back on assistance regarding English skills, bridging courses and orientation courses; cuts to child&hyphen;care centres and accommodation&mdash;again, issues that affect overseas students; and lack of resources, library and other education materials. The proposed cuts could make these resources virtually non-existent, especially on those campuses already suffering from chronic underfunding. Our international reputation depends on these resources and services being of a high and competitive quality for all 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1137"> students&mdash;another issue which threatens Australia's reputation as an international education provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">International students have been hurt not only by government attacks on the higher education sector but also by the needless, inciteful and ill-informed race debate. Many of those students&mdash;and this is shown in surveys and polls that have been conducted in institutions around the country&mdash;do fear increased racism. They believe that it is of increased proportions on campuses. This belief&mdash;this idea&mdash;that is and has been perpetuated by the government that somehow overseas students have been displacing, or taking the places of, domestic students is a furphy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the minister on duty, Senator Minchin, might want to explain the rationale that was put forward during the higher education debate by the minister for higher education, Senator Vanstone: this idea that we are offering up-front full&hyphen;cost undergraduate fees now because they were previously offered to overseas students and thus, if not displacing domestic students, somehow domestic students should be offered that `choice'. I use that term loosely because I think the choice debate in this whole issue is a complete furphy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not the case that overseas students have taken places from domestic students. As I and many of my colleagues have expressed in this place on many occasions&mdash;be it during the immigration and ethnic affairs debates we have had or on a range of issues&mdash;again, we express our concern that the government did not instantly, wholeheartedly and entirely repudiate many of the comments made by Ms Hanson, the Independent member for Oxley. In fact, the government has allowed, almost encouraged, this urban myth, if you like, of the displacement of places to be perpetuated in our community. It certainly is the responsibility of this parliament, this government and certainly of the minister&mdash;be it the minister on duty or Senator Vanstone&mdash;to correct that particular issue and set the record straight on racism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet the government's budget has also cut campaigns to combat racism and build a more 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tolerant society. Again, the Democrats lament those particular changes&mdash;not only lament them but find them absolutely shameful. We believe that we must start acting more responsively towards international students&mdash;in fact, towards all students in our society. This bill will go some way towards that goal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I urge the government to reflect on the impact of its funding cuts to the higher education sector, and to assess the social deficit its zealous pursuit of its budget black hole has created. I would hate to think that we are creating some kind of intellectual, moral or what have you range of deficits in this country in a bid to address the so-called budget deficit.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am replacing Senator Margetts essentially in responding to this legislation on behalf of the Greens. I will refer to her excellent notes in doing so. The Senate is debating two bills which deal with education services for overseas students. The first bill&mdash;the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996&mdash;is a non-controversial bill which extends the current act until 1999, due largely to the failure of the states to implement their own regulations by the existing expiry in 1997. It should be noted that this is not the first time that we have had to extend the act for this reason. Senator Margetts trusts that it will be the last.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second bill&mdash;the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Bill 1996&mdash;is more of a problem because of the manner in which education service providers are being charged to cover the costs of maintaining the Commonwealth register of institutions and courses for overseas students. As the bill currently stands, English language intensive courses for overseas students' colleges which run English language intensive courses for students from elsewhere around the world, will bear a large burden of this cost because of the structure of the charges, which do not acknowledge the reality of short intensive courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts originally circulated an amendment which attempted to rectify this situation. The government has now moved 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1138"> some of the way to acknowledge the issues which she raised by means of their own amendment. Senator Margetts, therefore, will not proceed with her amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The aim of the government in this bill is to reverse the decline in the private health insurance system by giving a subsidy to low and medium income earners towards the cost of private health insurance and by penalising high income earners without private health insurance by a one per cent surcharge on the Medicare levy. There are some problems at the outset with the implementation of this scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, income thresholds are not graded and this will lead to significant marginal tax rate effects. Secondly, income thresholds are not indexed, so the numbers of lower income earners eligible for the subsidy will decrease over time and those higher income earners subject to the surcharge will increase. Thirdly, people who self&hyphen;insure are not eligible for the subsidy or to be exempted from the surcharge. That is, the bill pushes people from self&hyphen;insurance into the private health funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the likely effect of this? Currently about 33.3 per cent&mdash;one in three&mdash;of the population is covered by private health insurance. Significantly, as other speakers have said, this is a halving of the percentage, two&hyphen;thirds of the Australian populace having been covered in 1983 before Medicare was introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will be the effect of this stimulus for people to join private health insurance? It is estimated that it will be very limited. The coverage due to these bills may be increased by two per cent or three per cent, or, according to the Productivity Commission, at the high range, 5.2 per cent in the percentage of people who have private health cover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some points need to be made about the issues in this legislation. Firstly, Medicare is popular, that is very clear, and the declining membership of private health funds is not necessarily a problem&mdash;except, of course, to the profit line of the private health funds and to the wellbeing of those funds themselves.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cause of declining membership of those funds, besides Medicare being as popular as it is, has been pointed to by earlier speakers. Firstly, there is a high level of out of pocket payments for doctors' fees during hospital treatment, and then there is the rapidly increasing premiums themselves. I think anyone who has got an acquaintance with this system can instance some stories like those referred to by Senator Carr. People have gone to their health fund expecting to get 70, 80 or 90 per cent of their money back, thinking that they would be covered under private health insurance for doctors' services, and they have found they were getting less than 20 per cent of the amount of money expended. So they immediately throw their hands up in the air and say, `What is the point? I am paying $250 or $300 a quarter'&mdash;that is for single people; it is much more for families. `Where is the benefit in paying $1,000, $2,000 or $3,000 a year if I am not going to get most of the cost of my health care returned?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a fear that as more people drop out of the private health funds they will place an increasing burden on public hospitals. But that fear is not well founded and certainly has not been well tested. While everybody agrees that public health systems are creaking and groaning in most areas of the country, the change in the percentage of people with private health cover has not led to the end of the world as far as our health systems are concerned. A significant number of people are choosing to self&hyphen;insure: 15.6 per cent of patients who go to private hospitals, for example, and 42.7 per cent of those using private day surgery. I reiterate that those folk are going to face a heavy disincentive as a result of the legislation now before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the extent that declining levels of private health insurance are a problem for public hospitals, this ad hoc package of incentives and penalties will not solve the problem because it does not solve the structural issues which are causing such pressure on public hospitals in this country. Direct and explicit subsidies for private health insurance are new and the money could be better spent on other more urgent priorities in the health care field.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1141">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of the subsidy inherent in this legislation is over $600 million per annum once the scheme is fully implemented; it will be $1.7 billion over four years. That compares with a total expenditure on health of $38 billion, of which $4 billion is through private health funds. They are a pretty small component of overall expenditure. So the government is now proposing to contribute directly a sum which amounts to 15 per cent of current health expenditure through the private system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $600 million per annum could be better directed to community based health improvement programs rather than directly subsidising the private system. That will be very clear to people who have had much to do with the health delivery system in this country. Maintaining and strengthening the public health system allows the government to directly address causes of ill&hyphen;health. If you look at the example of air quality, you see that in Melbourne 20 per cent of asthma attacks are related to ozone from traffic, as are a significant proportion of the 300 deaths from respiratory problems associated with particulates which are generated from traffic, basically coming out of the exhausts of vehicles in the inner city region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What could $600 million per annum or $1.7 billion over four years do to ameliorate those statistics? A heck of a lot. There are so many ways in which primary health care could be boosted by this huge amount of money which instead the government is using to try to boost the private health insurance industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the Greens support the Medicare levy surcharge. We oppose the link to private health insurance, which cuts out self&hyphen;insuring people. I need to just say here that it is a tax&mdash;a tax on higher income earners. I do not cavil at that, but I think the money is being hypothecated across to the private health system and it ought not be. It is stimulating the private health system. The government would be better putting the money from the surcharge, as well as the incentive from the levy, into generating a better public health system and into taking some of the pressure off the public health system that we currently have.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We oppose the private health insurance subsidy. So there it is. On the final summary, we oppose the subsidy because it is good government money basically being given across as a stimulus to the private health system instead of going into the public health system. Let me say that again. We oppose the subsidy&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, I appreciate your assistance in taking the chair to enable me to contribute to this debate. These private health insurance bills introduce this change by the coalition government to very significantly alter the funding arrangements of health care in this country. They do so directly breaking a number of election promises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, there were promises that there would be no new taxes. The people who earn more than the specified income level and who do not have private health insurance will certainly be enjoying, as the expression sometimes goes, a new tax. That is breaking a promise, deliberately and directly. Secondly, there were promises that Medicare and funding to public hospitals would be preserved. That is exactly counter to what this government have done. They have done it in a most wasteful and ineffective way. I would like to spell out some of those points in the time available to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that it is very interesting to recollect what Premier Kennett had to say on this matter. I notice that the best defence that the coalition government can mass against what Premier Kennett has had to say is that sometimes Premier Kennett gets it right, which is a pretty feeble defence. Premier Kennett has said that this is good money after bad and that it is a very ineffectual contribution towards private hospitals. The best the Treasurer (Mr Costello) or the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) can do is find other quotes where Mr Kennett said differently.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1142">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what this clearly shows is that Mr Kennett is confused and the coalition government, Mr Howard's government, is embarrassed. They ought to be. They have offered incentives to people to take out private health insurance. These incentives total $1.7 billion over four years. What the evidence already shows is that people are continuing to leave private health insurance in the face of the promise just around the corner that will help them stay there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are people leaving private health insurance? It is very simple. Senator Brown said it: the only way you can get a bill in this country is if you have private health insurance. If you are covered when you go to hospital under Medicare, you get no extra bill or costs. The only way you get a bill is if you have private health insurance. You would think that the coalition government&mdash;which claims to be very au fait with the free market and the importance of small business and what goes on out there in the real world of economics and so on&mdash;would understand that, if you are trying to sell a product that is directly and deliberately doing counter to what it is set up for, people would not want to buy it. And people do not want to buy it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Brown said, many of us can come in here and give examples, as I have done before and I will do again. Many a time people have written to me and said, `Look, Senator, I've been paying my private health insurance premiums for 30 years. After all this time I suddenly need to use them. I have been to hospital. What do I have? I have a bill for $3,000, and I do not know how I am ever going to pay it. Senator, what can be done?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The answer is, `Well, private health insurance is no longer delivering what it was set up to do.' It was set up, way back, to protect people from high health costs, from significant health bills that would put them into financial straits. Worse still, for people who did not have health insurance, those bills were so worrying and frightening that they refused to go and see the doctor. We know that because of the millions of people who were without insurance prior to the Labor Party coming into government in 1983. With the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> introduction of Medcare, suddenly all those people who had no health insurance were free of the worry of big health costs. The only people who still have big health costs are those with private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How long is it going to be before this government recognises that this is a really daft product? Firstly, if you want to get a health bill, get private health insurance. It does not protect you; it guarantees you get a bill. Secondly, the premiums that people have to pay just continue to rise. In the face of promises that those premiums would be kept down, we have seen this government dealing with the embarrassment of&mdash;having given a promise that they would assist people with the cost of their private health insurance&mdash;seeing that promise eroded before it was even delivered, with the cost of the private health fund premiums very significantly rising in the last 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have a product that fewer people want to buy. We have a product that is terribly expensive and getting more so. We have a product that does not do what it is set up for, which is to protect people from big bills. Of course the citizens of this country are saying that that is a very silly thing them for them to be pursuing. Of course people are leaving in droves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this is doing is giving some people a worry. Now that the coalition is in office, it might find that it has to change the language and the fear and the loathing that it spread for 13 years while it was in opposition. The coalition kept frightening people about what would happen if they did not have insurance&mdash;that there would be very long waiting lists and so on. They kept avoiding the fact about waiting lists and they kept insisting on frightening people so that some people still feel it is essential to have private health insurance to avoid long waits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For very few conditions do people have to wait very long at all. The conditions for which people have to wait are the same conditions that they had to wait for during the 1980s, 1970s, 1960s and 1950s. You can go right back and see that the longer waiting lists have always been in orthopaedics; ear, nose and throat; and with eye specialists. That still 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1143"> the case. Of course, that is no reason to be complacent, but it is also a reason to assure a lot of people that their fears about the need for private health insurance are probably largely unfounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, if you were trying to assist many of those people you would actually be doing what you promised to do in the run-up to the election and maintain your funding for the public health system, because that is where so many people are turning for the elective surgical procedures that their doctors judge or diagnose that they need. Please do not misunderstand that or come back at me by saying that I really said that doctors are making people have surgery that is not necessary. I am not saying that at all. If a person's general practitioner makes a diagnosis that they need this specialist care or specialist procedures, then that is what they will seek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in elective surgery people are now turning, more and more, to the public hospital system, just in time to find a coalition government which has actually slashed grants to the states by $1.5 billion over three years. That is a cut of about $500 million to the states' health funding, about one-third of health expenditure. They have also made direct cuts to public hospitals of more than $300 million over four years and they have taken other massive amounts out of health totalling more than $3 billion over four years. This is a direct contradiction of what people were promised by the coalition in the run-up to the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only have they decided to put $1.7 billion over four years through private health insurance subsidies, but those subsidies are going to be funded by those cuts to public hospitals of $800 million over four years, cuts to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme of $500 million over four years and the abolition of the Commonwealth dental program, saving $400 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts to the public hospitals alone are equivalent to closing 1,000 beds or turning away 66,000 people who are waiting for operations. It is interesting that, at a time of bolstering private health insurance with these incentives, private health insurance and the use of private hospitals for private procedures 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have never been so large. At a time of falling private health insurance coverage, there has been increased use of private hospitals for increasing private procedures. Many of them are done in day surgery, but it is a measure of how many procedures are being done in the private sector through private hospitals. This certainly runs counter to any scaremongering that says that private hospitals were under threat by Medicare, which was one of the claims made by the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consider: there are approximately six million Australians eligible for health care concession cards. About six million Australians currently have private health insurance. This policy takes funding away from the health care concession card holders and give it to the privately insured people. This policy is going to force pensioners to wait longer for elective surgery in public hospitals, pay more for their essential medicines and pay up to $200 for dentures in order to subsidise people with private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To suggest that people who are not insured at the moment will actually be encouraged to buy private health insurance&mdash;that is, to find, for a single person, about $800 necessary to buy private health insurance so as to be eligible to get the government's $125 incentive&mdash;is really flying in the face of the evidence. This incentive may encourage people already with private insurance to stay in insurance, but it certainly is not going to encourage people who have decided not to find $800 to move into private health insurance. That is what people might have thought: at least it will stop the drain. But, indeed, the evidence is already counter to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Private health insurance figures continue to fall. The incentive that is there for people is not persuading anybody to make that decision. The evidence is counter in terms of the numbers of people in private insurance, and the premiums for private health insurance continue to rise very significantly. This incentive is really $1.7 billion straight down the plughole. It is doing nothing for private health, it is doing nothing for public health and it is doing nothing for any of those people who are so dependent on our public hospitals for all their care.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1144">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown and, I am sure, others have said&mdash;the government may not want to say it; they might choke on it&mdash;that the people of Australia really value Medicare. They really like it, to the point where those policy&hyphen;free zones opposite actually adopted the slogan, `We too like Medicare. We too will not change Medicare. We too have become believers.' Well, if you believe that, as the community is beginning to discover, you would believe anything. But not for long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You say that you support Medicare, but you are not serious. You have actually pulled billions of dollars out of the public sector, counter to what Medicare is about, and the community will not thank you for that. To take money from the public hospitals and from health care card holders and patients to put it into our private hospitals&mdash;not even into the private hospitals but into reducing private health insurance premiums&mdash;is already proving to be ineffective and is certainly not going to win you votes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect others have listed the increases in premiums. In August, the HBA in Victoria announced increases of six per cent and Australian Unity announced increases of 8.6 per cent. After these increases, as the coalition saw its incentives effectively wiped out, the Prime Minister intervened and set up an industry inquiry&mdash;a new approval process in which he took personal responsibility for future increases and requested that funds not have further increases until the inquiry reported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funds paid not the slightest attention to the Prime Minister's plaintive call. We saw Manchester Unity announce increases of 17.5 per cent shortly afterwards. HBA in Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory announced premium increases of around nine per cent in October. In November, Australia's two largest funds, Medibank Private and MBF, announced passive increases of 12.9 per cent and 15 per cent respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the funds, even in the face of the coalition government's intervention and the Prime Minister's personal intervention, continued to raise their premium prices by very significant amounts. In the face of that, they knew that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people would once again take a decision to desert private insurance. Premiums are just too much and they do not give people the security, assurance and comfort against big bills. As I said in opening my comments, the only way you get a big bill is by having private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last month's private health insurance figures showed that people continued to drop out despite the fact of the imminent incentives. Last quarter, over 150,000 people dropped out of private insurance. Now we have the AMA, or some parts of it, urging people to give up private health insurance, to set aside some money or make private arrangements so that if they do have outlays in health they can pay for it themselves. They are saying that buying private health insurance is no good judgment of how best to protect yourself against those costs. In other words, what they are saying is that premiums are far too much and that people would be much better putting those premiums aside and spending them, if they need to, on any health charges they might incur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things I wanted to ask the minister goes to the administration and the understanding of definitions. Clause 3-3 of the explanatory memorandum is headed `Income test&mdash;policies covering only one person'. Clause 3-3(2)(b) states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This subclause provides that the persons whose taxable incomes are to be taken into account when determining eligibility for the scheme in respect of a policy covering one person are:</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">if the person covered under the policy is a dependant child, the incomes of each parent who is paying premiums for the policy or arranging for a third party to pay premiums for the policy and of any partner of each such parent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would like an assurance that the words in this clause do not allow for the incomes of the partners of two separated parents with a dependant child, who are both contributing to health insurance for that child, also to be involved in the income assessment. Can I have that assurance? As it stands, the clause reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and any partner of each such parent. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1145">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I read the bill and the explanatory memorandum, I believe that two separated parents contributing to the cost of private health insurance for a child, both of whose incomes were taken into account, may under this wording find that each of their new partners may have their income taken into account for the purposes of this assessment. I would like an assurance that that is not what these words mean or at least that these words are not open to that interpretation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the administration of this whole area will be a real nightmare. People are going to have to complete a 15-page form. I wonder whether it is the same 15-page form that they had to complete in order to get Austudy, or is it a slightly different form? Can we be assured that this 15-page form will not cause the same trouble, confusion and anxiety we have seen caused in the area of Austudy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previously, you could pay your contribution for Medicare at the end of the year or out of your tax through PAYE. You were covered then, all your bills were paid and you did not have to worry when you went to hospital. Now, to even get the incentive, you have to roll up and fill out a 15-page report. This is a nightmare! It is a total policy disaster. Senator Heffernan, you can say that I am getting wound up. But I do not really have to. You have actually committed the greatest balls&hyphen;up in Medicare history since you were last in office. You had seven years in government and five different health policies under Prime Minister Fraser. You are at it again. The people of Australia are already walking and telling you that they do not like this incentive at all. The premiums are going up. Their costs and their protection are not there at all. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want firstly to thank senators who participated today in the debate on the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill and associated bills. The contributions from various senators have been considered and thoughtful, irrespective of the views they have taken and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> notwithstanding the government's opposition to a great deal of what they have said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset, let me say to Senator Neal that the government will oppose those second reading amendments put by the opposition and by the Democrats. We on this side make no bones about fostering and supporting the private health system. This is not simply because we believe the private sector offers Australians choice and flexibility in their health care but because the services, infrastructure and financing of the private sector actually complement the efforts of government through the public hospital system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it is only an indicative measurement of this contribution, I note figures released recently by the private health industry which show that private health benefits injected over $4 billion into the Australian health care system even while the number of contributors continues to decline. This clearly is a significant contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, there has been some revived debate of late about the efficacy of private health insurance in the late 1990s, including comments by leading members of the Australian Medical Association and some others. It has been suggested that fostering private health fund membership is a waste of money. The government rejects this entirely. At the end of the day, private health insurance remains the path of affordable choice for most Australians, particularly for those members of the community for whom a large medical and hospital bill is hardly something which can easily be absorbed from their savings or other assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This does not take into account the pivotal role that the private sector plays in easing the pressure on strained public hospital resources. The Department of Health and Family Services has estimated that people who dropped private health insurance between July 1993 and September 1994 actually used the capacity equivalent to two metropolitan public hospitals for one whole year; that is, for every day of one year they could fill two metropolitan hospitals. To reduce such stress and strain on the public system the government is firmly committed to its policy strategy to better spread demand across the whole hospi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1146"> tal system, public and private, and maximise the totality of the community resource rather than build otherwise unnecessary new public hospital capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now turn to the Democrat position, which was put forward by Senator Lees. We understand the point of view underlying Senator Lees's foreshadowed amendments and that they reflect Democrat policy that is well established and on the record. But, clearly, we differ with the premises that she has put forward. We look forward to seeing the Democrat amendments and considering them in the committee stage. I restate that the government believes that its proposed measures actually do what the Democrats have always stood for: actively encouraging those who can most afford to do so to make a more appropriate contribution to covering the cost of health care for themselves and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the position of the opposition, let us look at what they have had to say. We have before us now Labor's second reading amendments to the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2). These amendments encapsulate the differences between the government and the opposition, who, for all their posturing now, had 13 years presiding over the health system of this country and left it breaking at the seams.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say something about this second reading amendment and the opposition's view that the commitment to these incentives is at the expense of the public system. Firstly, I am pleased to see that the opposition will not oppose the passage of these incentives. Secondly, this at least recognises that this is a commonsense approach to a community's mandate for the greatest range of flexibility and choice when it comes to the medical and hospital system. But finally I would add: given that Labor in the last election was offering low and middle income families up to $350 towards their private health insurance costs, saying `many families who would like to take out health insurance to better manage their health care would find the premiums too high', Labor can hardly say anything else

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In their own offer to the Australian people, Labor recognised the coalition was right in identifying that what people want is choice and that what the system needs is a safety valve that relieves the pressure on public hospitals, particularly in relation to elective procedures that are at the core of waiting lists. I am sure the opposition cannot begrudge us making the assistance of the incentives available to a great many Australians, including some 80 per cent of Australian families as well as aged pensioners and fixed income retirees, who will benefit from the fact that they do not have to be an income tax payer to be eligible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition also talks of the government undermining Medicare and the public hospital system. What we are doing is in the wider national interest. I say again: the public hospital system is in disarray because of the extra demand placed on it by people leaving private health insurance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Only recently, Senator Neal, we heard Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, complain about these pressures&mdash;after having kept his mouth shut when his federal Labor colleagues were in power and when his factional ally Senator Graham Richardson sought to do something to put a floor under private health insurance membership in 1993. What did he say then?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To say that we have shifted money into the pockets of private insurers at the cost of public hospitals, of PBS outlays and the like is another furphy. The fact is the budget required decisive measures to deal with the unconstrained growth in Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits scheme outlays. We have acted to ensure that Medicare, public hospitals and the PBS remain capable of meeting the needs of the community. We have acted to ensure that they will not in a few years time fall over under their own weight of both demand and cost. These measures will not only complement Medicare but keep it strong and healthy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1147">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now turn to the Medicare levy surcharge. I actually thank the opposition for their second reading amendment for, while they put strings on the surcharge, they do not actually reject the concept, nor the need to encourage higher income earners to make a contribution to their health care through private health insurance. This will free up as many public hospital waiting list places as possible for those for whom private health care is a far less affordable proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the surcharge is an integral and essential component of the whole package which cannot be treated or, as the other side would prefer, knocked off in isolation. What we on this side cannot understand is why the Labor Party and others are so actively against this measure. We are not talking about a two-tier Medicare system. The surcharge does not undermine the universality of Medicare. All eligible people will continue to pay the basic levy. The surcharge will be asked of only those who can afford it yet still opt not to provide themselves with even the most basic private cover. As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said at the time of the last budget, `this is a surcharge that we prefer no-one has to pay'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is more, we are not stopping those affected by the surcharge from accessing Medicare or public hospitals if that is their choice. I thought that the Labor Party stood for battlers, for the people who struggle&mdash;not the truly wealthy. Their opposition to this measure shows just how much the political landscape has changed since March last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the opposition's second reading amendments which I have mentioned, the government rejects the opposition's contention that any revenue raised from the surcharge should be hypothecated to public hospitals. I remind the opposition that, when they set up the Medicare system in 1984, from day 1 all receipts from the levy were paid into consolidated revenue, not a Medicare account. The levy contribution roughly equates to about one-quarter of these outlays. Proportionally, the levy pool would be slightly augmented by the surcharge. But, at the end of the day, we will continue to honour our obligations to Medicare and to the nation. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition amendment should be seen for what it is: a base political stunt. The opposition stance on this matter is discredited by their record of 13 years in government and what they did, or did not do, for the public health system. In conclusion, today is an important day for Australian health consumers for it is a milestone on the road to greater choice, greater quality of care and greater quality of health insurance protection against illness and injury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, I want to take up one other point raised by the shadow minister for the opposition in that other place, and that was an implication that these incentives were in fact a benefit for the wealthy and that the roughly six million-odd pensioners and concessional card holders would be mutually excluded by the health fund contributors of roughly the same number. The government's reply to that is that they are not mutually exclusive groups. As we stated in our policy statement `A Healthy Future', which was based on ABS data, over one million Australians in 1992 on incomes under $20,000 to $21,000 per annum, which included some 600,000 singles, had private health insurance. This proportion probably has not changed. In fact, it is probably even greater today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the battlers, many of whom made great sacrifices to keep up their private health insurance because they are frail, ill or old. They are the ones who most deserve these incentives. Because we have ensured that people do not have to become an income tax payer to get the incentive, they will benefit. We do not intend to let them down. I hope those opposite, in considering their position on these bills, have turned their minds to these people, the people who deserted them in March last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures are not the whole answer to the health problem we face as a nation, but the government sees them as an integral part of a strategic approach to solving them. They will go a long way to creating greater stability in our health care system by halting the exodus from private health funds. Hopefully they will encourage some growth in membership of private health funds. They will also enable services to be planned and delivered

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports the amendment to the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 1996. The amendment to the principal act has two main purposes. Firstly, this bill seeks to enable the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games and the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee and licensed users to take action against all 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parties who may be involved in the supply of goods and services to which protected indicia and images have been applied by an unauthorised user.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, this bill will make it easier for the organisers of the Sydney 2000 Olympics and Paralympic Games and licensed users to take action against those persons who are engaged in ambush marketing. Ambush marketing is the unauthorised association of a business with the marketing of an event such as the Sydney Olympics. The ambush marketeer seeks to gain some benefit by suggesting an association with an event without paying for the marketing rights or the licensing fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments contained in this bill will enable games organisers and the licensed users to take action against retailers, distributors or other parties in the supply chain rather than having to pursue through the supply chain the unauthorised person who applied the indicia or images to the goods or services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, this bill will provide that action may be taken against those who aid, abet, counsel or procure breaches of the principal act. This will enable the Sydney organising committee and the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee and licensed users to take action against persons whose involvement in the contravention of the legislation is in the nature of assisting the unauthorised application of indicia and images rather than in their direct application. These measures will help ensure the preservation of the games marketing revenues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as protecting the revenue of the games against ambush marketing, they help ensure that the interests of legitimate retailers are protected from less scrupulous competition. Retailers, distributors and other parties will need to check to ensure that persons who applied the indicia or images to the goods or services are licensed. To do this, they need to check the register of licensed users located at the Sydney Olympics organising committee office in Sydney or the state offices of the Australian Industrial Property Organisation to ensure that the person is entered on the register. The Sydney organising committee proposes to provide easy access to the register 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1150"> of licensed users of the indicia and images and to provide a sophisticated identification system for genuine products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Sydney organising committee will also conduct a public awareness campaign and will be advertising in the various media. Retailers and other industry associations have agreed to cooperate with the Sydney organising committee in the dissemination of information so that the public is aware of and understands the legislation as it relates to the licensing of users of the protected indicia and images.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions contained in this bill, together with those in the principal act, will cease to operate after 31 December 2000, following the completion of the games. The Olympic Games is going to be a substantial event in Australia's history and the benefits which will flow to Australia because of it will be outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again indicate that we have absolutely no objections to the proposals contained in the amendment. I commend the government for taking the necessary action to protect those retailers and others who have paid considerable sums of money for the rights to produce material for the Olympics that contain the appropriate logos and images. They deserve the protection of this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will also be brief tonight as the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Amendment Bill 1996 is non-controversial legislation. I think all of us in this chamber agree that legitimate retailers, legitimate licensed businesses, should be protected in this way. We should be making sure that unauthorised use of logos, motives or images for gain is not allowed at whatever stage of the retailing system that illegal unauthorised use occurs. There should be the ability to prosecute; in other words, to give greater security to those people who are supporting the Olympic insignia for both the Sydney 2000 Games and also for the Paralympics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will go one step further and say: if only we could protect some of our unique national logos. Symbols of our native animals&mdash;for example, the koala&mdash;turn up on goods from 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Asia, giving the false impression that these are genuinely made in Australia. The kangaroo can be seen perhaps on Korean goods or those made in India, again giving the false impression that these goods are Australian made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the government for this move tonight. But I ask them to look again at the issue of Australian labelling so that we may protect our national symbols, our national logos, and give Australians greater confidence that when they see them they are buying Australian products.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="1150" TIME="9.37 p.m." SPEAKER="Campbell, Sen Ian" NAMEID="H15" ELECTORATE="WA" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;The Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Amendment Bill 1996 is an important part of what the Commonwealth government and the Commonwealth parliament have power to do to ensure that the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games are a success. The coalition when in opposition did take the initiative in this matter when it became clear, particularly to me as the shadow minister for sport at the time, that the previous government had not gone far enough to protect the games from ambush marketing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate, on my motion, referred this matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for investigation. That committee took evidence from the New South Wales government&mdash;the then Liberal government as it was&mdash;SOCOG, a number of private enterprise organisations associated with the Olympics, and a number of other groups. To the credit of the Senate committee, it came down with a unanimous report urging legislation to effectively give the ownership of the name, symbols, indicia and images of the Olympics to SOCOG so that, if a corporation, business entity or even a private individual were to choose to become associated with the 2000 Games, then they would need to be licensed accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other side of the coin, if someone chose to associate themselves with the games, to make profit from that association and to do so without that licence and approval of SOCOG, the games organising committee, then they would be in breach of this legisla 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1151"> tion and could be pursued under this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition as part of its election platform promised to introduce legislation to give proprietorial rights to the Sydney 2000 images and indicia when it came into government. Indeed, I remember being asked by SOCOG people at functions during the election campaign if we could write to the IOC ensuring that they were reassured that the coalition would proceed with this legislation. I am proud to say that this certainly made it into the core promise section of the coalition's election manifesto. As I recall, it was certainly one of the first five or six bills passed through this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the opposition and Democrats who have made this non-controversial. I welcome the comments of Senator Carr, who I did not know had an interest in the Sydney 2000 Games. He is clearly a man with a wide range of interests. Anyone who reads this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will see that Senator Carr has made a very constructive contribution to this very important debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to thank Senator Lees, who throughout the period of this legislation&mdash;the introduction of the principal bill and the development of this amending bill&mdash;has been supportive. It would not have been possible to legislate so effectively and so quickly without that sort of cooperation. I do thank Senator Lees and the Democrats for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown did raise some concerns he had with an aspect of this legislation, but those concerns have been put to rest. I do thank all honourable senators for their contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amending legislation, as Senator Carr has quite accurately said, gives the games organising committee a far more effective instrument for tracking down people who would seek to ambush market in relation to the Sydney 2000 Games. It ensures that the games organising committee can go to anyone in the chain of supply of a good or service related to the 2000 Games. The original principal bill made it a little bit tortuous to find the correct culprit. This gives them broad powers to be able to go to a retailer selling a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bogus Olympic t-shirt, for example, and to use the full powers of the act against that person and to then chase the culprits up the supply chain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In these matters, as was very clearly demonstrated at the Atlanta Games I am informed, you need to be able to move quickly because people who are coming in to sell hats, t-shirts and all the other paraphernalia that go with major sporting events, can often import materials, set up a stall near one of the games' venues and start flogging off the material, to use a colloquialism. You do need very quick and flexible legislation and laws to be able to catch these culprits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure all Australian citizens wish the Sydney organising committee all the very best in the coming couple of years. It is crucial that those people who put up money, particularly from the private sector, by way of sponsorship have that sponsorship protected by this sort of legislation. This amending bill will ensure that the coalition's promise to deliver this protection is honoured in full. I conclude by again thanking all honourable senators for their contribution tonight.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning in the other chamber my colleagues Michael Cobb, the member for Parkes, and Jackie Kelly, the member for Lindsay, moved and seconded a motion, under private members business, of profound significance to Australia's war history. The motion calls for a greater historical recognition of the importance of the Kokoda Track campaign in World War II, and pays tribute to and seeks recognition for the Koiari people known as the fuzzy wuzzy angels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This evening I lend my support to that motion and the endeavours embodied in it. I do so because I, along with some of my 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1152"> political colleagues, joined a group just some four weeks ago to walk that historic Kokoda Trail. Anyone who saw the very high rating television show last year in regard to the celebrities who walked the Kokoda Trail will recall that very famous scene where Angry Anderson `lost it'&mdash;where that very tough guy Angry Anderson embraced his Australian guide and was unable to go on, so difficult was the trek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that in our endeavours to walk the track it was evident very early just how tough it was going to be. As the plane hovered over the Owen Stanley Range preparing to land&mdash;looking for a gap in the clouds so that it could land&mdash;at Kokoda, I started to have great empathy with Angry Anderson because those mountains, the Owen Stanley Range, looked merciless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone in the group&mdash;and it was a group of some 23&mdash;had a different reason for taking on the trek of a lifetime&mdash;and, indeed, it was the trek of a lifetime. Some members of the group had fathers who had fought in Papua New Guinea and were making the trek in their memory. By the end of the ordeal, they said that they understood and appreciated far greater their fathers' lives and what they had had to endure in World War II.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the politicians, who usually get front row seats at Anzac Day ceremonies, this was a chance to get a better feel for the Anzac tradition by retracing the steps of our troops. From the very first day it was obvious that the land would live up to its very harsh reputation of unforgiving hills and drenching rains, and the trekker was given some idea of and insight into the conditions under which the soldiers had had to fight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But really it was Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Honner, a commanding officer at the time, who best set the scene:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Worn out by strenuous fighting and exhausting movement, and weakened by lack of food and sleep and shelter, many of them had literally come to a standstill. Practically every day torrential rains fell all through the afternoon and night, cascading into their cheerless weapon-pits and soaking the clothes they wore&mdash;the only ones they had. In these they shivered through the long chill vigil of the lonely 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nights when they were required to stand awake and alert but still and silent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The reward for the intrepid trekker, the modern day trekker, was to stop at these historic sites and be lectured on their significance&mdash;such sites as Isurava, which has been dubbed Australia's Alamo. It was here that the Australians made an epic stand against the full onslaught of the Japanese army. Although they were ungunned and outnumbered, they held up and inflicted massive casualties upon the Japanese army. It was here that Private Kingsbury was awarded Australia's first Victoria Cross to have been awarded on Australian territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australians were still in retreat when they made another stand which became known as the Brigade Hill battle where some 1,000 diggers faced a force of 6,000 Japanese. With great courage, the diggers were able to hold up the Japanese long enough to exhaust their supply lines. Eventually this tactic turned the campaign into an Australian victory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what we trekkers felt we had in common most with the World War II veterans as we retraced their steps was the bond that they personally forged with the local Papuans whom they nicknamed the fuzzy wuzzy angels because of the help they had given in a time of great need. At many of the villages where we camped, we were greeted by the original fuzzy wuzzy angels. It was a very moving experience to know that these quiet old men had at one time extended the hand of friendship and help to our embattled soldiers. The gratitude felt for the fuzzy wuzzy angels was beautifully put in a poem by Bert Beros:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Before it is too late and the last `angel' dies, we must recognise their efforts by at least striking a remembrance medal. The medal would be a great source of pride to the fuzzy wuzzy angels who are still alive&mdash;and, really, that is all they ask for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the 10&hyphen;day walk along the track we felt like giving the fuzzy wuzzies a medal because they truly deserved it for the number of times they helped us ragged and exhausted trekkers. Because of what happened on the Kokoda Track, every Australian should regard it as sacred ground. This story really does rival the legend of Gallipoli. We were then defending our own territory and, indeed, our country. We were in command, they were our tactics and we ultimately won. Against the odds, we won by nothing more than raw, awe&hyphen;inspiring courage, with the help of the fuzzy wuzzy angels. That is why it is sacred ground. That is why I support the motion moved in the House of Representatives today. It is a story waiting to become a legend for generations to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the motion moved by Michael Cobb and seconded by Jackie Kelly does have the private support of the minister, for he knows only too well what a spartan effort the Australian soldiers carried out in World War II. What is embodied in that motion, in particular, is the striking of a medal for those fuzzy wuzzy angels whom we met along the track and who are still alive today. As I said before, it was a most emotional occasion to meet these quiet men who we know at one stage had lent a hand to our soldiers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should add that Senator Jim Short's brother served on the Kokoda Track. I believe that Trish Worth's father served in Papua New Guinea and her uncle served on the track. It is surprising how many of that generation are still alive today. As I said, this legend rivals Gallipoli, and we won. It deserves to be put to the forefront of Australia's history.  </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I would like to add my condolences to the family and friends of Edna Ryan. In doing so, I also extend this to the Australian community, which has lost such a remarkable woman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect that this woman has had on my life is tangible. She was one who opened many doors. I believe her life exemplifies the very real contribution she has made to all of our lives. The death of Edna Ryan has given many Australian women reason to contemplate feminism and what it means to be an activist on behalf of women in 1997. It certainly has provided a stark and timely reminder to me that the position that women currently hold in our society has not evolved naturally but has come about because people like Edna stuck their necks out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Edna Ryan was a woman who demonstrated an enthusiasm, drive and commitment for women's rights and social justice principles that have left many of us reeling in her wake. She has been described as a visionary who remained a contemporary&mdash;a strange juxtaposition, but one that suits a woman who has inspired so many women, including me, and who has also remained one of the most informed and relevant contributors to feminism in the women's movement in Australian history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Her commitment was born of life experience. It was not acquired through extensive formal qualifications but it was academia and influential Australians who turned to Edna for inspiration and advice. Recognition of this contribution came in the form of an honorary doctorate from Sydney University in 1983. Edna Ryan had a knack for being able to anticipate where the barriers to women's equality were going to emerge. This foresight enabled her to get in early to inspire others into supporting her campaigns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Australian women and men collect on 8 March 1997 to celebrate International Women's Day, we should do so remembering that it was a 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Edna Ryan who first joined the International Women's Day demonstration in Sydney's Domain in 1928. This rally was for equal pay, and it fuelled the fire 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1154"> in the belly of a woman who continued to demonstrate on behalf of all Australian women for almost all of her full and extraordinary 92 years. She was a feminist when feminism was not a mainstream movement. In 1997 she was a feminist when it is still not considered a part of mainstream Australian society. Or is it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The relevance of feminism today is an issue explored by many recently. So, without being too philosophical or complicated, in Edna's memory, I would like to make a small contribution to the commentary on the issue. For me, when I was growing up I did not know that there was any difference between genders. As far as I was concerned, there were no barriers. That was how my parents raised me. I was employed in a non-traditional area for women at a comparatively young age and was paid equal pay and was expected to do equal work. No problem! I coped with varying degrees of success, like everybody else, and I did not see much in the gender equity thing at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Imagine then the dawning realisation that I did not really get this job because of me but because there happened to be a union campaign to encourage more women into the building industry. Imagine the dawning realisation that I did not get paid the same because I did the same work but because so few women had ever worked in the industry that there had never been the need to insert a clause to differentiate rates of pay or, perhaps more poignantly, never the opportunity for inequitable wage parity to evolve. Imagine the dawning realisation that I was not valued as greatly as my male colleagues when I was made redundant before them, even though I had heaps more experience. Imagine finally realising, after all that happened, that there was substance in gender equity and that genuine equality for women, despite being a reality in my mind and the minds of many in my generation, was still something to be sought&mdash;and, in the current political environment, something to be defended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I often wonder if the experience I have described is specific to my generation, which can be loosely described as our having distant echoing memories of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I am woman </EMPHASIS>being 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> played by our parents, or if this is how it happens regardless of your life span or your experiences. Here's looking towards the day when dawning realisations are nothing but conspiracy theories. I do wish it were so. Edna Ryan knew it was not so. Many other Australian women and men know it is not so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Edna Ryan, during periods of her life, could not vote, was not paid half of what her male counterparts were paid, was on a pittance as a single mother raising children, had limited educational opportunities and fought her way into local politics in the trade union movement, despite public perceptions of these professions being dominated purely by men.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many years on, there is still gender inequity in Australian society and women of all ages are experiencing these dawning realisations, whether or not they think of themselves as feminists. In paying tribute to Edna Ryan, I want to say that, despite whatever label is attributed to any type of political activity designed to progress the status of women to a genuinely equitable position in our society, we need to recognise this contribution for what it has achieved and what it can achieve in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I choose to call myself a feminist because this embraces the thoughts and feelings that I have. I hope to continue to convey these sentiments as they evolve because I know that the quest for equality is a dynamic pursuit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud to say that in this country we have had the privilege of knowing, despite her modesty, a woman that can only inspire people&mdash;in particular, young women&mdash;to become more politically aware and, hopefully, politically active. I feel proud that many women can use the channels of change that Edna helped dig and constantly clear throughout her life, including those involving the formal parliamentary process. The women's movement, led and encouraged by Edna, has demonstrated the impact that the movement can have on spreading these messages and building even more channels of change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My feminism is as I interpret it. I have no illusions as to the massive challenges that existed when Edna Ryan sussed  out her lot in life, as I have no illusion now as to the lot in life in which we find ourselves under this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1155"> conservative government. I will continue to draw from the strength provided by women like Edna and hope that I am also inspired by the sight of the light at the end of the tunnel that inspired Edna to fight for equality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to close by reading the last words of Edna Ryan, which profoundly say so much about her. They were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to thank all the men and women, people in all walks of life who gave me help and information.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite an honour to follow Senator Lundy's speech. It was great and I would like to think that many more people in this place would be willing to stand up and assert themselves as feminists in this chamber, especially on the conservative side of politics. Hear us roar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also quite interesting to listen to Senator McGauran's speech but, unlike Senator McGauran, I will not be quoting poetry. What I do rise to speak about tonight is a book that I had the honour to launch two weeks ago with a colleague from the House of Representatives, Rod Sawford, the member for Port Adelaide. It is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Seen and Heard</EMPHASIS> and nicknamed `A foolproof guide to the youth vote'. Undoubtedly, this has been targeted at politicians, both state and federal. It is a project undertaken by young Australians aged 15 to 26. It took over six months to compile a list of their responses to issues affecting them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This book is a wonderful counter to some of the negative stereotypes we have recently seen perpetuated in the media, and in this place, of young Australians. It certainly is a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> book that celebrates the wit, diversity, humour, and talent and skills of young people, specifically in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These young people were asked to pretend they were ministers and say what they would do if they were a minister, be it the minister for the environment, the minister for love or the minister for economics. They were also asked what they thought of politicians. Some of their responses as to how young people see politicians are worth noting. The words they used were: `get rich,' `mud slinging,' `have long holidays,' beef themselves up,' `mostly male,' `tell lies,' `make promises,' `get to the top and then get toppled,'`stress out,' `are boring,' `act like kids' and `their travel allowances are too high'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think no&hyphen;one in this chamber would deny the fact that young Australians, and perhaps Australians generally, view politicians with a degree of scepticism and perhaps disillusionment. That is something, of course, we all should be working to counter, along with families, teachers and parents. On that note, I do express my concern that civics education funding has been frozen under this government, albeit, I acknowledge, with a promise that a new program will start. Certainly, we will not start to redress the lack of electoral awareness in our community, and especially among young Australians, if we do not have such programs operating in schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Seen and Heard</EMPHASIS> project mostly used the visual medium of cartoons and some drawings. These were displayed in the Port Adelaide Community Youth Centre. They were over six feet high, beautifully and wonderfully coloured. I would like to think that perhaps that exhibition could be a travelling one and we could see it here in Parliament House at some stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I seek to leave to table this booklet because I think it says much more than I could about it. Of course, that is the idea of it. I imagine all politicians in this place will be receiving a copy from the Youth Affairs Council of South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do ask politicians in both houses to acknowledge some of the comments that these young people have made in relation to participation. Some of the comments include: 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1156"> `young people are not acknowledged on a political level;' `many of us feel that we do not know enough about our choices when it comes to voting;' `a lot of us just tick any old box.' I appeal to many colleagues to read the document. I end my contribution this evening with a quote from a voice bubble in one of the cartoons in the book. Someone says:</PARA>
