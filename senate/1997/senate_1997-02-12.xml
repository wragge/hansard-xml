<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="504"> costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable `active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="7L6">Senator Hogg</NAME><FROM>(from six citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER>and <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator Tierney</NAME><FROM>(from five citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 fulfils the Government's election promise to introduce a Charter of Budget Honesty and emphasises the Government's commitment to improving fiscal performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for improved fiscal outcomes in Australia is clearly demonstrated by the persistence of Commonwealth deficits over the past 25 years, the ratcheting up of Commonwealth general government net debt and falling levels of national saving.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth general government net debt has increased from around 2.5 per cent of GDP in June 1972 to around 19.2 per cent of GDP currently. Over the past 5 years there has been a greater than five fold increase in Commonwealth general government net debt which now stands at $93 billion. By this measure alone there is clearly a need for governments to improve fiscal outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will rectify this situation by implementing institutional arrangements to improve the formulation and reporting of fiscal policy. The need for such arrangements has already been supported by independent bodies such as the National Commission of Audit and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the framework contained in this bill incorporates many of their recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The improvement of the fiscal position will only be achieved through greater discipline, transparency and accountability in government fiscal policy. The Charter of Budget Honesty will achieve all these outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fiscal discipline will be enhanced by requiring government fiscal policy to be formulated according to principles of sound fiscal management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transparency and the accountability of government will be substantially increased through improved disclosure of fiscal policy intentions and the regular reporting of information on fiscal developments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, the Charter will prevent future governments going to an election on the basis of outdated and misleading information on the fiscal and economic outlook. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="512">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, this bill will ensure that at all times this government, and all future governments, can be held to account for their fiscal and economic policies, providing a sounder basis for improved economic performance and sustainable job opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, I will now describe the main features of the fiscal framework that will be established by the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Fiscal Policy Formulation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will reform fiscal policy formulation through introducing principles for the sound management of fiscal policy against which governments must develop their fiscal strategy.These principles will focus attention on a range of issues that must be addressed if fiscal policy is to be sustainable over time. In doing so they will establish an appropriate environment for setting and assessing fiscal policy, without restraining government or Parliament in their pursuit of other, non&hyphen;fiscal, objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principles take account of the need to address short term issues, such as cyclical economic downturns, while recognising the importance of medium-term issues such as the sustainability of government debt and national saving.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The presentation of a government's fiscal strategy, as required by the bill, will also increase public awareness of a government's objectives and establish a benchmark for evaluating fiscal performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Fiscal Reporting</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Charter of Budget Honesty will also ensure that up to date information is available so that a government's performance can be assessed against its fiscal objectives. To achieve this the bill establishes a formal reporting structure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With each year's budget a report will be released setting out economic and fiscal projections for the budget year and three forward years. These projections will illustrate the consequences of the adopted fiscal strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further report released mid&hyphen;way through the financial year will update the fiscal and economic projections contained in the budget report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The details of fiscal outcomes for the just completed financial year will be presented in a report to be released within 3 months of the end of that financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, an intergenerational report will be produced every 5 years to report on the long-term sustainability of current fiscal policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These reports will provide fundamental information that will allow government performance to be assessed against the objectives set out in the fiscal strategy statement. However, the bill also gives 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particular attention to ensuring that important fiscal information is available during the election period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill requires the Secretaries to the Treasury and the Department of Finance to prepare a pre-election report providing an updated assessment of the fiscal and economic outlook. Never again will a government go to an election without the public being aware of the current economic and fiscal situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the bill provides for more equal access to Treasury and Finance costings of election commitments by the Government and the Opposition during the caretaker period. This will allow the electorate to be better informed of the financial implications of election commitments.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion Madam President, the Government believes that that the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 represents a landmark development in the conduct of fiscal policy and reporting of fiscal outcomes. The bill will provide a strong impetus towards achieving better fiscal outcomes by providing greater discipline in policy formulation, regular statements of fiscal objectives and increased accountability for fiscal performance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, Senator Harradine is wrong. The government does believe that more than minimum family payment is essentially a welfare benefit. It is not a universal payment based on the needs of children, as you would find with other payments. Essentially, minimum family payment and the family tax initiative are similar, in that they are near to universal payments. Neither the family tax initiative nor the minimum family payment will be affected by the waiting period, so all migrants will have both those from the time they arrive in the country. But, essentially, the more than minimum family payment is in the nature of a welfare benefit&mdash;which is, of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> course, what we said at the election that we would cause to have a waiting period apply to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history is that family allowance was introduced by a coalition government in 1976. It comprised partly child endowment and partly tax rebates for children. In our election commitment we talked about maintaining access to family allowance. By maintaining access to minimum family payment&mdash;which is what that family allowance has become&mdash;we are keeping that commitment. However, in addition to family allowance, there was a family allowance supplement which is now known as more than minimum rate of family payment. It is this separate payment on which the government now seeks to apply a two&hyphen;year waiting period, Senator Harradine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you bear in mind that the minimum family payment is essentially the old basic family allowance and the family tax initiative has come in to join it&mdash;in both cases they are available to all, regardless of whether or not people are in the work force&mdash;I believe that families are provided for under the government's plan. The more than minimum family payment is appropriately designated a welfare benefit and, therefore, comes under the ambit of the general thrust of the legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is quite serious about supporting this motion not to insist, as distinct from the previous one. I will be opposing this motion. One of the reasons for that is that you mentioned in your speech previously, and repeated it today, that the government went to the election on a particular platform. Might I remind you that in respect of this particular matter&mdash;I seriously make this point through you, Mr Chairman, to the minister&mdash;before the election in your press release you said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Access to welfare benefits for migrants other than refugee and humanitarian migrants will be available after two years under a Coalition Government. This extension will have little direct impact on those migrants, particularly those in the Preferential Family Reunion category who are accepted for entry into Australia on the basis of formal assurances of support.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="515">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full access to Family Allowance and Medicare will be maintained for all migrants immediately upon arrival.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In your statement explaining the history of the measures, including the additional family payment, you obviously acknowledge that people were aware of what this was&mdash;that is, at one stage it was called a family allowance supplement. Then it was added to. When the rank and file voters in this country hear you say, `Full access to family allowance and Medicare will be maintained for all migrants immediately upon arrival', there is only one thing they would think about&mdash;that is, the family payments, including the additional family payments. That is what people refer to colloquially as family allowances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can quote all the technical stuff you like, but I am talking about what the voter thought. The voter clearly would get the wrong impression. You do not say that family allowance and Medicare will be maintained for all migrants immediately upon arrival. There is no such thing as a family allowance now. You say that full access to family allowance will be maintained for all migrants immediately upon arrival. That certainly would convey to voters that you meant what you said&mdash;in other words, full access to family payments, including additional family payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with the approach that I have taken on this matter, I will be voting against the motion. At least so far as I am concerned, with respect to the other members of the committee, I think the committee should insist upon that amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nobody has lied in this matter at all, Mr Chairman. It is a question of a payment having changed its name&mdash;two payments evolving in the social security system. The minimum family payment and the family income supplement, or family allowance supplement, were essentially two separate items. The family allowance at the time the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments </EMPHASIS> document was prepared was understood to be the basic family allowance. You got a top up on that if you had income support needs. It was a welfare measure. That is why there has been a misunderstanding about terminology, but the direction and the purpose of the government were consistent. So I utterly reject the interjection from the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a question of the name change of the payments having, I think, confused the issue in the minds of some people. There was always a basic payment for families, with a top up for welfare measures. That has caused the problem here. We are saying that the basic payment for family, as we said in our election document and as I reiterated in my press release of 23 May, will still be available to all those families. But the additional top up we are proposing should be included in the category of welfare benefit that we described in our election manifesto.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So what we get again is the government's insistence that welfare benefits be cut to people who are in need because they happen to have newly arrived in Australia. That is why the chamber should be standing firm and rejecting the government's bid to have this two&hyphen;tier system and to make these new citizens second&hyphen;class citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The change, by the way, between Mr Costello's statement in February last year which Senator Harradine read out indicating that the full allowance would be available and Minister Newman's qualified statement of May is pivotal on the fact that in March last year there was an election. So the indication to the electorate before the election, that this benefit would be kept, changed after the election to an indication that it was going to be scrapped. It was a change of heart simply because the government was in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again it is important for this chamber to stand by the amendment made before Christmas defending the right of newly arrived Australians to access these benefits. The minister says that it is a welfare measure. That implies just what it is: it is for people who are in real need in this country. We should ensure that those people newly arrived in the country who find themselves struggling&mdash;very often due to the change of circumstances that follows their arrival here; circumstances that can be unforeseen&mdash;ought to be able to have the same access to these benefits as every other Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I pointed out last night, a very small amount of money is involved here. It shrinks into insignificance almost when compared to the handout to major corporations through tax breaks and so on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Similarly, the Australian Democrats have not changed their position on this matter. The original amendment that I moved back in, I think, November&mdash;Democrat amendment No. 19&mdash;dealt with the issue of the family payments. We sought to omit that particularly mean&hyphen;spirited and regressive measure in the government bill. We do believe that these measures should be insisted upon. I reiterate that we think they are penny&hyphen;pinching, mean&hyphen;spirited measures. They are targeted at the most vulnerable in our community. Once again we only have to look at the family payment, who that will target again&mdash;migrant women applying for multiple birth allowances, rent assistance, guardian allowance. So, once again, the Australian Democrats believe this should be insisted upon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found extraordinary the minister's comments regarding the Treasurer's election documents as opposed to her own press release. I think Senator Faulkner's comments yesterday were right; I bet they do regret calling it <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS>, given that this is a government that has, I think, broken about $12 billion worth of election promises so far. So this is not an issue of mandate. As I said yesterday, it is not a case of `my mandate is bigger than yours'. These are bad measures. For that reason, the Australian Democrats continue to oppose the two&hyphen;year waiting period applying to social security benefits, but specifically in this case to the family payment.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He sits there as arbiter of who will be cut out of welfare payments and who will not and then says, `The Senate did it.' It is Senator Harradine who is cutting thousands of newly arrived Australians out of their right to access welfare payments. Let me quote what he had to say in November last year when this measure was first before this place. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have seen no reason whatever to change my mind and I think it would be unstatesmanlike for the government to go to the people on this measure and whip up an immigration debate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>  of 30 November. One has to ask: why the change of mind now? That question still hangs in the air. Nothing else has changed. There is no increased climate or change of climate to justify the fact that we are seeing in this chamber a single change of vote from Senator Harradine which is cutting out thousands of newly arrived Australians from their access to welfare if they are down on their luck. And this is the country of a fair go!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine uses the words `charitable' and `compassionate' very often. He used them last night in this debate. Where is the compassion in having used his single vote to cut out to thousands of Australians newly arrived in this country who find themselves in hard circumstances these benefits which we have judged, through years of development of our social security system, Australians ought to be given access to. Well, he says, `Not these Australians.' That is his decision. That is his vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine thought it was good enough for them to have access to the benefits last November but for reasons which escape us, which have not been put before the chamber, he now says, `I am going with the government's harsh budget cut&mdash;the "let the poor and needy be cast out" philosophy&mdash;and I am going to determine, by crossing the floor in the opposite direction to the one I took last November, that they can be left out in the cold.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think we should end the proceedings without noting that Senator Harradine has totally failed to justify his change of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="520"> heart&mdash;his new heartlessness in this matter. What we are about here is cutting out these people for a small monetary benefit to the government. Senator Newman says it is $107 million all&hyphen;up per year, but that is in the same year that $800 million will be handed on a platter to a handful of big mining corporations as a rebate for the diesel fuel levy. So it is a twisted antisocial logic that the government is employing and, I submit, now it is the same twisted antisocial logic that Senator Harradine is backing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take some umbrage at this statement that the chamber has just saved the additional family payment. It took Senator Harradine to come across on this side of the committee to save that payment. It would have been just as easy for him to cross to this side of the committee last night to save the other payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a really sad moment for this chamber that it is seen to be losing to the government in the House of Representatives on these amendments which the government sent back up here because Senator Harradine has changed his mind. He has failed to get up and justify that change of mind as against his strong stand from last November, when he saw no reason whatever to change his mind on protecting these newly arrived Australians from having their rights taken away to have access to social welfare.</PARA></SPEECH>

I find it ironic especially when the coalition, in opposition, were the first to jump up and down about retrospective measures and how we should never change the goal posts on people while they were in a particular position so I find this a rather duplicitous position in that respect. But I take on board Senator Faulkner's comments too about the fact that these people have been on, and have obtained, benefits quite legally. It is not only inappropriate for them to be paying them back but also for them to feel that they have somehow obtained these benefits in a way that was wrong, illegal or inappropriate. I cannot imagine&mdash;although I am quite happy to seek clarification on this&mdash;that it would be that big a deal for the department perhaps administratively as well as politically.

If it were determined before royal assent, if they were deemed eligible, they would get it. If it came after the date of royal assent, they would not.

The special benefit of which you have spoken is only applicable as a discretionary thing by the secretary.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="528"> (11.21 a.m.)&mdash;Mr Chairman, we are really talking here about people who are either business migrants who are deemed to be able to support themselves or people who are being sponsored into the country and whose sponsors therefore have a commitment which we would expect them to honour. Regardless of whether their country will allow them to bring in money or not, that is something they know ahead of time before they venture here. That is not a new circumstance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There could be new circumstances that occur, for instance, where somebody has brought or been able to bring money to this country and, for some reason that is beyond their control, that money is no longer available to them in this country. It could be, for instance, that they invested it in a company that immediately went bankrupt. If there were to be anything like some of the spectacular failures we have had in the 1980s in Australia and somebody had thought they would come to this country as a business migrant and put their savings in there, before long they would be without any funds at all. That would be a circumstance that had altered beyond their control since coming to the country, and they would then be eligible. But a circumstance they knew about beforehand of their being able to bring only a certain amount of money would not be a circumstance that had changed since their migration.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996&hyphen;97 Budget Measures) Bill proposes a number of changes to veterans and war widows' entitlements&mdash;some of which are unambiguously good, some of which are fair and some of which in our view are decidedly unfair. The financial impact of this bill may be minor when viewed in the context of the budget as a whole, but the effect on a number of our veterans will be great. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Scott), in his second reading speech, says, `The veterans' affairs 1996 budget package honours key pre-election promises to the veteran community.' When the minister says `key promises' what he actually means is that the government has honoured some of its promises but not all of them. The coalition promised before the election that they would `maintain all existing veterans entitlements'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They did, Senator Woodley; they are the words of the government before the election campaign. So whilst veteran specific entitlements have been largely untouched, it is in the area of mainstream aged care services where the veteran community in Australia has come in for a real hammering. The government's structural reform of aged care will net savings in the vicinity of half a billion dollars. A further $88 million will be saved through the additional user charges for home and community care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="532">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Veterans make up around one&hyphen;quarter of the male population aged over 65, and veterans and war widows together make up around 15 per cent of the total population aged over 65. So, quite clearly, the veterans community will substantially contribute to the cost cutting measures of this government through a reduction in their entitlements. We say that, without qualification, that is a broken promise. I think it is worth touching briefly on a few of the measures in this bill because this is the first opportunity we have had to debate them and one of the first opportunities this year to bring the government to account over its broken promises to the veterans community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the infamous nursing home entry contribution, the government's decision to align the nursing home system with the hostel system will result in many veterans and war widows having to pay an entry contribution to gain admittance to a nursing home. There is no limit on what nursing homes might charge, but hostel entry fees might be indicative. The average is around $26,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government said that their decision to impose an entry fee on new nursing home residents was simply a matter of aligning the two systems of nursing home care and hostel care. That is just not a defensible position. The two types of care are radically different. Hostel care can in many cases be seen as a lifestyle choice, and that level of care is also available in the home through community aged care packages. Nursing home care, on the other hand, represents a far more serious decision on the part of the resident. It is a hospital level of care reserved for those who are frail, often extremely frail, or suffering from dementia. If a potential resident is deemed by an aged care assessment team to require a place in a nursing home, it is considered the appropriate care mechanism available to that person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to income testing recurrent subsidies, many veterans and war widows residing in hostels and nursing homes will be subject to an additional charge of 25c in the dollar above the pension free area. For a single veteran, any money earned over $98 a fortnight will be reduced by a quarter, up to a maximum of $238 a week. Current residents 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> did not plan for this when they entered residential care, and their financial plans in many cases will be ruined. It is an inequitable measure that targets frail aged veterans and war widows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the increase in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme concessional patient contribution, although a 50c increase in the patient contribution to the pharmaceutical costs may not at first blush seem very large, it is affecting a group of people on relatively small fixed incomes. Again, they were not warned of this added impost, and many will find it difficult to adjust to the new expense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is really difficult to know how the increase in user charges on home and community care is likely to fall as it will depend on the states and the providers. I think veterans are already significantly disadvantaged when it comes to HACC services. The states have admitted that many providers discriminate against veterans because they assume that their care is the sole responsibility of the states. This measure will have a compounding effect on veterans' ability to access HACC services. So the Senate can see that veterans and war widows have not escaped lightly from the government's budget cuts. For the government to suggest that they have honoured their commitment to the veteran community is hyperbole in the extreme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the specific measures in this bill&mdash;firstly, amendments relating to allocated pensions. This measure amends the service pension asset test treatment of allocated pensions. The current asset value of allocated pension investments will be taken into account for the purposes of the assets test regardless of the person's age, effectively closing a loophole and I think aligning the Department of Veterans' Affairs with the Department of Social Security, which instituted a similar measure in July 1992. We agree with the government that it is unfair that some people could gain increased income support and be entering into particular investment arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to amendments relating to earnings credits, the earnings credit scheme allows pensioners and allowees to take up temporary or casual work without affecting 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="533"> the level of their payment. Pensioners can accrue an earnings credit of up to, I think, $1,050, or $2,100 for couples combined, to offset earnings from employment before their payments are affected. This bill seeks to abolish that arrangement. The earnings credit scheme gave pensioners and allowees an incentive to take any casual or temporary work that became available without this income immediately or necessarily reducing their level of payment. We think this amendment is a regressive step, particularly when the government is purporting to encourage people back into employment and towards increased financial independence. People will now be deterred from taking up this kind of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition remains opposed to this reduction in veterans' entitlements as it represents yet another clear broken promise on the part of the government. To be fair I must say that we have had this debate at some significant length during consideration of the social security budget measures package at the end of last year. I also hope that minor party and independent senators in the chamber give serious consideration to the importance of the earnings credit scheme for veterans when we deal with this issue in the committee stage of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the amendment relating to funeral benefit, this measure provides for the payment of a funeral benefit for the transport of the body of a veteran who dies away from home in indigene circumstances. This is very much in keeping with the appropriately respectful and supportive treatment that veterans deserve through our repatriation system and it is a measure that has the support of the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the amendment concerning the Victoria Cross allowance, this will increase the value of the Victoria Cross allowance paid to Australian recipients to $2,700 and brings it into line with the same allowance that is in fact paid to British recipients. It follows the former government's granting of a special gold travel card to Australia's surviving VC recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to amendments concerning lump sum compensation payments, it is always a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> complex issue of course, but the device used to calculate preclusion periods is to be changed from the all persons average weekly earnings to the amount above which no pension is payable to a single person under the income test, which is currently $400.50 per week. Pensioners and allowees affected by this measure will be subject to longer periods without payments forcing them to use up their compensation at a lower rate before they are eligible for financial or continued assistance. The opposition, as it has indicated, opposes this measure. The preclusion period will be applied to compensation recipients only and not to their partner. That is for lump sums that are received after 20 March 1997 recovery of past payments to partners will not be made, nor will partners be precluded from receiving any future entitlement they may have received during their partner's preclusion period. The opposition does agree with that change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the amendments to extended deeming, this measure would apply a deeming rate of 4 per cent on all bank deposits held by pensioners and the unemployed. The first $2,000 for singles and $4,000 for couples is to be exempt as the below threshold rate and the actual interest earned, rather than the deeming rate of interest being taken into account under the income test. What we say is that this measure relies on pensioners and allowees being able to access accounts which in fact pay interest at the deemed rate. We have seen over the past few months Australia's financial institutions are reconsidering their interest rates on deeming accounts and, with the recent drops in official interest rates, pensioners and veterans are finding it increasingly difficult to get returns to match the deeming rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again it would be fair to say that this issue was one which was canvassed at quite significant length during debate on the social security package last year, but in this debate&mdash;consistent with the position that the opposition took at that time&mdash;we will be urging the Senate to protect veterans' incomes and support the opposition against the schedule of this bill. I think something like 121,000 DVA 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="534"> allowees in fact will be affected by this particular broken promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the amendments relating to service pension or income support supplement, this establishes a minimum variation regime for service pension and income support supplement. It prevents the Repatriation Commission from increasing or decreasing a pension unless the variation is at least $1 per fortnight, currently rounded to 10c. Whilst only a minor matter, it will minimise an unnecessary intrusion into pensioners' lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter I should touch on is those amendments relating to advance payments of service pension or income support supplement which extends full lump sum advance of $500 to war widows who are recipients of the income support supplement and removes the requirement to declare the intended use of the advance payment. We acknowledge that this measure will benefit some war widows and will reduce an administrative burden to recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 2 of the bill deals with a number of minor extensions of eligibility for benefits under the defence service homes scheme. It extends eligibility for assistance to persons who served in Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia and Somalia; it extends eligibility for assistance to certain widowers of World War II ex&hyphen;servicewomen; and it reduces the interest rate on new additional advances from 10 per cent to 6.85 per cent. Again, these extensions of benefits are comparatively minor. Nevertheless, I think they are ones that deserve the strong support of the opposition and the Senate, and they will certainly receive that level of endorsement from the Labor opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, this is in many respects a very disappointing piece of legislation to come before the Senate. It does represent the codification of a number of broken promises on the part of the government. Those are broken promises that I think since the time of the budget the opposition has been able to expose. On the other hand, there are some very good measures in this bill and the opposition, as is its practice, has no problem in standing up and saying that they are unambiguously 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> good. They are worthwhile initiatives and they will receive our strong support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are considering today the Veteran's Affairs Amendment (1996-97 Budget Measures) Bill 1996. This bill does contain a number of very worthwhile measures which, of course, the Australian Democrats will support and a couple of measures which we are not at all happy with. Most of the measures were announced in last year's budget and a number directly mirror changes which we have already considered as part of the social security bill which came before the Senate towards the end of last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the measures, as I said, contained in this bill will have a positive effect on veterans and their families. For example, the Democrats are more than happy to support the introduction of the payment of a funeral benefit for the transportation of the body of a person who dies away from home in indigent circumstances. We will support increasing the value of the Victoria Cross to bring it in line with that paid to British recipients and we will also support extending the eligibility for assistance under the Defence Services Homes Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there are two aspects of this bill that the Democrats cannot support: the amendments to the earnings credit and the amendments relating to lump sum compensation. Just in terms of compensation, I might add that this is a reversal not only of promises made but also of the position taken by the government when they were in opposition. I remember that debate very clearly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that the government will not be at all  surprised to hear that we are opposing these aspects of the bill because this is exactly what we did when we dealt with these matters in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996. Just in case anyone has forgotten, let me remind the Senate of exactly why the Democrats will not support these two changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The earnings credit scheme allows pensioners and unemployed people to earn a small amount of income without it affecting their income support payment. This scheme has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="535"> been a very valuable one to pensioners and the unemployed. In recognition of that, the coalition's social security policy document specifically stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Earnings Credit Scheme will be retained by the Coalition Government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government has changed its tune completely and now argues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Due to its conceptual and procedural complexity, the earnings credit scheme is difficult to administer and is also difficult for social security recipients to understand.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I must say that I am disappointed to see that the government is abolishing this scheme and trying to do so on the grounds that the scheme is too complicated. There is an obvious solution to complication; it is not to abolish the scheme but to abolish the complication. Somehow or other that seems to escape the government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. When the scheme was first introduced the Democrats pleaded with the then Labor government and the Liberal&hyphen;National opposition to support some amendments we were putting up to simplify the scheme. We always felt that this was a marvellous scheme and was going to be hamstrung by its complexity, and here we are just a couple of years later trying to abolish the scheme because of that complexity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People may very well not understand the mechanics of the scheme but they certainly do realise that it allows them to earn some additional income without affecting their income support payments. The success of the scheme is evidenced by the level of savings 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the government hopes to achieve through the scheme's abolition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add that the government would do well to look again at this, because in the whole proposal for work for the dole there is in fact a very easy way of accomplishing the objective in terms of voluntary work, that is, simply by fixing up the penalties which apply to voluntary work. I am sure that if the government did that they would actually find many, many more people volunteering to do work while they are on unemployment benefit. I am going to propose that kind of amendment at a later time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot support what the government is doing here because of the negative impact it will have on Australia's veterans. I really have to say `shame' to the government on this one. Their arguments are weak and, in fact, contradictory. What is worse, the effect on veterans is one that I really cannot contemplate or agree with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In like manner, the government's amendments to lump sum compensation will also have a negative impact on veterans, because it will increase the period of time injured people will be precluded from receiving a pension. I have to say to you that it is a pretty sneaky proposal which we have in front of us, and it is complex. Because of its complexity and because of the sneaky way that the formula is being changed, people will not really know what has hit them until, in fact, they have been hit. Let me explain what I mean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently the department assumes that 50 per cent of any lump sum compensation payment which contains an economic loss component&mdash;no matter how small that component is&mdash;is for loss of income. The department then divides this 50 per cent figure by the all persons average weekly earnings figure of around $560 to obtain the number of weeks a person will be precluded from receiving a pension or benefit. As of March next year, rather than using the all persons average weekly earnings, the department will divide the 50 per cent figure by the single pension cut-out figure. If that is not sneaky, I do not know what is.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="536">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of this will be significantly longer preclusion periods for people who have received compensation payments. It is a bit like that measure where the Treasurer half proposed it and then ran for cover when he got all the flak. Do you remember when he had a proposal to change the pension from average weekly male earnings to average weekly earnings? That was another sneaky move. This one is of a similar complexion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 50 per cent rule already disadvantages many people by forcing them to live off moneys awarded to cover, for example, past and future medical expenses or pain and suffering. This proposal will greatly exacerbate that. This is why the Democrats will be opposing it&mdash;just as we did in the social security bill last year. However, as we also did in the social security bill last year, the Democrats will be supporting the government's proposed changes to extended deeming. I would like to explain the effect of this change, as many people seem to be confused about the way this measure will affect them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This part of the bill will apply the lower deeming rate of four per cent to the first $2,000 to $4,000 of savings held in bank deposits by singles and couples. I want to put clearly on the record that these amendments will not affect those people who have only small balances in the bank. They will not affect those people due to the operation of the income free areas on pensions. The people who will be affected will be allowees with over $30,000 in financial assets, single pensioners with more than $52,000 in financial assets and pensioner couples with more than $90,000 in financial assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a good deal of confusion over the impact of this measure, so I say again that it will not affect those allowees or pensioners who have only low or even modest amounts of financial assets. For those people who are affected by this change, the average pension loss is estimated to be around 50c a fortnight, with a maximum loss of $2 a fortnight. Importantly, however, that loss can, for many of those affected, be recouped by adjusting their investments and consolidating their accounts into deeming accounts currently available from the various banks. I did hear 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what the opposition was saying but I believe at this stage, because of the numerous debates we have had on this issue, that the government is doing the right thing at this point, and I do not agree with the Labor Party's reasoning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I think this particular measure that we are looking at is very important for the positive measures that it introduces. It is important that we never forget that the expense of war does not cease with the end of hostilities. Even after peace is restored, the cost of war is still high in the lives of Australia's veterans and their families. For this reason, the Democrats will not support any policy which fails to acknowledge a special obligation to veterans or which does not recognise their special needs, but we will support those measures which benefit our veterans who certainly need our support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996&hyphen;97 Budget Measures) Bill 1996, I think I should declare my interest. This does not affect me financially, but both my parents are Department of Veterans' Affairs recipients. My father is on a TPI and a service pension and my mother, in her own right, is on a part disability pension. So I do have a personal interest in this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a child of veterans' affairs recipients, I know that they are experiencing difficulties as they get older. I know the problems that these changes have caused my parents, particularly my father. As has been said earlier, there are some parts of this legislation which are good and there are some parts which are not. It is a bit like the curate's egg&mdash;good in parts and bad in others. I have to say to the department and the government that the good parts&mdash;the parts we are going to be supporting&mdash;are great, wonderful. But I think the other parts are extremely cruel and very confusing and complicated to the veterans communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I actually deal specifically with some of those, I would like to remind people that the veterans will also be affected by other budgetary measures that were announced. They will be affected by the nursing home entry contribution; they will be affected by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="537"> the income testing of recurrent subsidies; they will be affected by the increase in the pharmaceutical scheme concessional patient contribution. And they will not, as on previous occasions, be having their pensions indexed to accommodate any rises in that concessional contribution. They will also be affected by the increased charges on home and community care schemes. Those are starting to have a major impact, particularly in some states where the states have also had their budgets cut and are having to apply user&hyphen;pays charges. That is a very cruel thing to be doing, not just to our veterans community but to our whole aged community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first area I want to concentrate on is the earning credits. This I think is a false economy. No matter whether a person is on an age pension, unemployment benefit or any other benefit, including the Department of Veterans' Affairs benefits, this earnings credit was an excellent way to allow people to be able to participate in the workplace to a minor or major degree, depending on what their needs, desires and abilities were. These credits actually smoothed out some of the lumps and bumps that occur when people go on and off benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know from talking to horticulturists and other people in the agricultural industry that in a lot of areas these growers are dependent upon those people on pensions&mdash;the younger pension recipients&mdash;to come each year and help them harvest their crops or help with other work around those properties. These people were able, using the earnings credits, to balance the income they received and to smooth out the lumps and bumps. If they had sources of income outside of their benefits&mdash;so that they might keep having to go off benefits, come on, go off, come on, go off&mdash;they were not having to wait the waiting periods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This removal of the earnings credits, whilst it might not be going to affect a huge number, Minister, certainly was an incentive for people. It allowed them to go and earn $1,000 a year or less without affecting their pension. It allowed them that little bit of pin money. If you have ever had any dealings with people who are elderly, you will know as well as I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> do that they like that pin money. It enables them to assist their grandchildren, to treat their grandchildren, and also enables them to save for their funerals. One of the key things that most elderly people worry about is whether they have enough money to get themselves buried. They want the dignity of being able to know that when they die they will be able to afford their funerals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With all the broken promises I mentioned earlier and the increases of costs to pensioners, age pensioners and Department of Veterans' Affairs recipients, we now have an erosion of the earnings credits. It is all just death by a thousand cuts. It is a general attack upon the ability of these people to remain self&hyphen;sufficient, to be able to balance their budgets, to be able to budget ahead and to not receive some nasty little stings in the tail when suddenly they have to go and say, `I have received this amount of income. I have to go off benefits and then I have to wait to go back on.' All that involves messing around, and the earning credits enabled that smoothing of that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that has caused a great deal of confusion and concern has been the extended deeming. For those who are fit and young and able to cope with changes, understand changes and understand why it is imperative that people should be maximising the amount of money they can earn in interest off their accounts, I put it to you that there are people who may have Alzheimer's or pre&hyphen;Alzheimer's, or people who are just uncertain about what to do, who do not want to have to move accounts. Some of these people may have been banking with the same bank or institution for 70 or 80 years, and suddenly, because not all the banks or institutions are particularly happy about this and they are not offering rates that are as good as others, people are being forced to change their banking institutions. This is a cause of a great deal of worry and concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned earlier my parents. My father is 80, 81 this year. He was a prisoner of war for four years in Germany. His carotid arteries are partially occluded, which is causing him to have some memory problems and to have some thinking and thought problems. This 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="538"> gentleman used to delight immensely in being able to work out which bank was giving him the best interest rates for the small amount of money he had invested. It was a joy and a delight and something he felt was a good pastime. But time has progressed and he is now not able to think it through as clearly as possible, and he is getting  very confused and getting very worried. Telstra must be really pleased with the number of phone calls that have had to be made to me and my brother by my mother and by him, because he has got confused as to what the requirements are and how precisely it is going to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to the department and the minister that a lot of veterans are in the same position. It is simply that age is catching up with them. They do not have the faculties that you and I have to be able to understand this, and this is more change. It is exacerbated by the fact that some of the institutions are not playing ball, as we would say, and are not offering as good results as some of the others, so it is imperative for some of these elderly people to shop around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to you that you are expecting 70&hyphen;, 80&hyphen; and 90&hyphen;year&hyphen;old people to have to become financial whiz&hyphen;kids who are adept, competent and capable of moving money around&mdash;not large amounts of money&mdash;to maximise their returns so that they can get the full pension. I know I am going to be told that there are all sorts of cut&hyphen;in and cut&hyphen;out points. But this is the whole thing, Minister: these cut&hyphen;in points and these ceilings are just the sorts of things that confuse the aged and the elderly. They confuse people who are not aged and elderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It behoves the government to look very carefully at what you are doing to these people who put their lives on the line for this country, particularly during World War II. Parts of this country were designated as active service areas. We saw people in these areas defending and putting their lives on the line and, in some cases, losing their lives. What do you think are the ages of the widows of those people who lost their lives between 1939 and 1945 and have never remarried? They are not young; they are very elderly women. There are also elderly men, whose wives served in the Second World War. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Nursing personnel and others were killed as well, but not many.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to you that you need to think about some of these things. It is over 50 years since the war ended. A person who was married at the age of 20 and whose spouse was killed in 1945 after having been married for one or two years, would be well into her 70s. Some of them are a lot older. I buried an aunt last week who was 81. She was the widow of someone killed in Singapore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should think about the pressures that are being placed on people of this age. We should think about the people in our families, whom we know and love dearly, who are having a struggle with this. I know the of pressure that this extended deeming change has placed upon my parents. My father is no longer in a position to be able to walk the streets to check every bank every day to see what interest rates are being offered. It is probably what he did do; but he enjoyed it and it kept him amused. My mother is more interested in having her finances in one place. She does not want to have to go chasing. She wants ease of management. Fortunately, when this was first announced, their bank was one of those that put out a product that met this need. But what if they had been banking or saving with one of the institutions that did not do this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Caring for people is difficult enough without these sorts of things. I have no problems with the motives behind extending the deeming, but you have to think about how it applies and you have to remember the ages of the people we are talking about. These people are not young. World War II has been finished for 52 years. Even the Vietnam conflict finished 25 years ago. Think about the ages of the people we are talking about. They are people who may have difficulties, who do have difficulties, because they are ageing. I think it behoves the government to work through this, to take a socially responsible attitude to their actions, to stop being economic rationalists of the nth degree, to stop being hard line about what they are going to do, because obviously that does not work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has said that it has to do a lot of these things because of our `black 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="539"> hole'. We were in government for 13 years to get that black hole. You have been in government for 9 months, Minister, and you have already got a $3 billion one. You are doing better than we did in that respect!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Please do not peer at me like that again! These two amendments go to the issue of the abolition of the earnings credit scheme for Veterans' Affairs pensioners. This is something that I indicated in my speech on the second reading. It is a matter that has previously taken a great deal of the Senate's time, as we dealt with the social security package last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 2 of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996&hyphen;97 Budget Measures) Bill will abolish the earnings credit scheme. Part 3 makes consequential amendments to the Social Security Act. As I have made clear, we opposed the abolition of this scheme for social security recipients. I regret to say that we were not successful on that occasion. This scheme provided an incentive for people to take up casual or part-time work opportunities, because income from that employment did not affect their payments immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already, I might say, the opposition has become aware of people choosing not to take up those sorts of opportunities because of the abolition of the scheme. I think the arguments that I noted at some length late last year have, in some cases, proven to be most prescient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say clearly again that this is an important measure. I urge senators to reconsider their vote on whether this particular scheme should be abolished. For those reasons, and the

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to indicate that the Australian Democrats will be voting with the opposition on this issue and opposing the government's proposal. I again make an appeal to the minister. If your argument is that the scheme is too complex, then obviously what you must do is simplify it. But if what you are really doing is looking for spare change to perhaps fill up that Costello black hole, then you ought to be up&hyphen;front about that and say that the real reason you are abolishing the earnings credit scheme is that you actually want to get rid of some expenditure and improve the revenue side of the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is the reason, it would be better that you said that. The reason you are giving for abolishing the earnings credit scheme just does not make sense. I might add that it really does fly in the face of the debate we are now involved in&mdash;a debate about working for the dole. This is a disincentive to that very proposal. It is an issue that you are going to have to revisit if you do bring in some scheme whereby you work for the dole. You are going to actually have to look at the earnings credit scheme, look at the amount of time that volunteers are allowed to work before they are penalised; all of those issues will actually need to be brought into that kind of proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am saying to the government is that you should really revisit this one. Perhaps it is a bit difficult for you to do it now, but I am saying to you that it is something you will have to revisit if you are going to proceed down the road of any work for the dole scheme. We will be opposing this and voting with the opposition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All senators who take part in this debate will well remember the arguments that were raised on the issue of the earnings credit scheme in the social security legislation before Christmas. Complexity is a very serious problem in this area. There was a very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> low take-up. As I recall, it was three per cent of people who were eligible to take advantage of the scheme in the Social Security portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is actually a different situation here, Senator Woodley, because we are largely talking about older people. I am advised by the Department of Veterans' Affairs that there has been a negligible take&hyphen;up of this measure because of the age of the people getting the entitlements under this department. Most people are retired and are no longer seeking work. An additional incentive for pensioners to take up work is no longer considered necessary. Of course, probably more important than anything is that when you look at the amount of the income free area which the current income test provides&mdash;and that is, after all, what the Labor government changed in 1995&mdash;the income test arrangements were so changed to make it worth while for anybody who wanted to go and earn some extra dollars to just do it, because they still kept a substantial proportion of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A single pensioner can retain $98 a fortnight of earnings under the current income test arrangements. A pensioner who is one of a couple can retain $172 per fortnight. In those sorts of circumstances it seems to me that the earnings credit scheme is not needed by Veterans' Affairs pensioners. As I say, it has had a negligible take&hyphen;up rate to the extent that the explanatory memorandum says that there is no financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that it is really very important that, where we can, we have both the social security and the veterans' affairs systems consistent. Also, I have been advised that there has been no real concern expressed by veterans or ex-service organisations.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="542"> Minister of Papua New Guinea; the Premier of Bougainville; the governments of Cambodia, Vanuatu, Nauru and Tonga; Jose Ramos Horta, Nobel Prize winner from East Timor; the head of the Kanak Development Agency, Gerard Sinato; and representatives of the United Nations&mdash;in expressing support for the sterling effort provided over the last 57 years by Radio Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More than 80 nations operate foreign radio services, and several nations have more than one. In a very competitive market, Radio Australia broadcasts for over 45 hours per day in nine languages: English, Indonesian, Mandarin, Cantonese, Papua New Guinea Pidgin, Vietnamese, Khmer, Thai and French. By way of contrast, the Voice of America broadcasts for 138 hours per day in 46 languages, and the BBC broadcasts for 125 hours a day in 38 languages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite its small size, Radio Australia has earned an enviable reputation for the remarkable standard of its news and cultural programs. The number of listeners is perhaps harder to determine. Figures have been used to show a decline in the number of listeners, but this may only illustrate that recent figures of between five million and 20 million are based on more accurate methods of estimating audiences. However, it does not show conclusively that people are switching off. Recent statistics for most of China, Burma and India were not available to be researched. The statistics also exclude listeners in America and Europe. It is therefore difficult to get a true picture of the size of its audience. Yet even the estimated figures represent a greater audience than any station in Australia; 100,000 listeners from 150 countries send in letters each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Radio Australia has been regarded as our best ambassador. Australian interests in Asia are given an enormous boost because of the image of Australia as a clean, green, friendly country being promoted by the service. Most of the senior officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade recognise the value of the service in projecting into Asia and the Pacific the image of a liberal democratic power, a non-threatening nation with respect for the truth and a genuine concern for human 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rights. Radio Australia enhances Australia's diplomatic standing in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has also become the vehicle for opening up trading opportunities in the Pacific and South-East Asia. Through Radio Australia, a positive image of Australia can be portrayed which is essential for those making decisions on doing business with or in Australia, those contemplating Australia as a tourist destination, those considering supporting Australian enterprises and recommendations on the world scene and those looking for better educational opportunities for their children. Many business events covered on Radio Australia are not reported in any other form of the media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the capitals of the Pacific island nations, public broadcasters are in the habit of running direct broadcasts of Radio Australia news and current affairs. There is no cheap and easy substitute for the goodwill and respect that this generates. Programs which bring locals up to date with sport, entertainment and ideas promote a sense that Australia does care about, and actually engage in, the region. With the end of the Cold War, we have seen the withdrawal of both Soviet Union and US interest in the region. Japan and China give a certain amount of aid to the region for domestic and trade purposes. The French territories still receive assistance from their motherland. But Australia is the one country which provides an independent, objective and reliable service which helps them to gain a more accurate and balanced world view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The penetration of radio still far outweighs other media in the region, including our closest neighbour, Papua New Guinea. China has outlawed private satellite dishes, and listeners have reported that they cannot access the Internet. A radio service is still therefore of vital significance to those in many of the rural and outback areas of Asia and the Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Its news programs, in Asia in particular, attract an educated and influential audience seeking a more regional focus than that offered by the BBC and without the North American bias of Voice of America. Many generations of Asians have learnt English through Radio Australia and at present its language programs in China are extremely 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="543"> popular. In doing so, they have also learnt about Australia's culture. Now we have a steady increase in the number of students from Asia and the Pacific attracted to education in Australia as well as a fledgling industry of Australian education in Asian countries. For many in Asia and the Pacific, Radio Australia has been their first contact with Australian culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through the open learning program broadcast in Khmer, Cambodians can track the evolution of the Australian political system since the Second World War, including the formation of political parties, governments and parliamentary debates. But for Radio Australia our style of government which has made us only one of eight democracies to last through the 20th century would be unfamiliar to many. For a country just giving birth to democracy, an understanding of Australian government is vital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Pacific region, it is very often the only source of news. It was through Radio Australia that the people of Bougainville first learnt of the assassination of Theodore Miriung, the former Premier of Bougainville, last October. In Indonesia the English teaching service is used extensively and many Indonesians have started buying Australian foodstuffs because Radio Australia keeps talking about our clean and green image. It is highly regarded by a generally well-educated audience in Indonesia, and conveys the messages that Australia is the most interested and most expert in Indonesian affairs of any Western country. Transmitting programs overseas which will enable Australians living abroad or travelling outside Australia to `obtain information about Australian affairs and Australian attitudes on world affairs' is an obligation of the ABC, as stated in its charter, and is very important for Australian expatriates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A well&hyphen;informed Australian expatriate community in Asia and the Pacific which is able to present a contemporary view of Australia is one of the best ways of influencing perceptions of Australia overseas. This audience is at the cutting edge of presenting views on Australia to friends and business associates, and their importance to Australia's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> trade and diplomatic objectives should not be underestimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent years, the Radio Australia Internet presence has generated considerable activity to listeners worldwide. Thirty thousand letters were received on the Internet from listeners in response to a Radio Australia questionnaire in September 1995. The web site receives 150,000 visits a month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that, for the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year, just $13&half; million and $7 million in transmission costs have been appropriated to run this service. This should be noted in the light of the $490 million spent on the diplomatic activities of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I believe the value of the services that it provides is well worth the sort of money we spent on it. I trust that there will be further careful and detailed discussion before any decision is made regarding its future. I thank the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="543"><TITLE>Trade Outcomes and Objectives Statement</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The trade outcomes and objectives statement released last week by the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) provided the government with an opportunity to deal with strategic structural issues facing Australia now and into the future. It was also a chance to repair many of the mistakes made by the government in industry and trade policy since coming to power last year. Instead of doing this, however, the government provided a largely administrative document falling short of the government involvement required to improve our status on the world stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This document is a hope document. It relies on other nations to set the pace and conditions of our own growth and sets many of its premises on the presumption of overall growth in the world and our region which they hope will trickle down to Australia. Australia needs a more strategic and integrated trade policy in order to meet the expectations of our firms and to achieve an improvement in net export contribution to national growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issues and challenges Australia needs to be facing are those that have shown themselves in world trends for the last century and, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="544"> in particular, since the Second World War. These issues are: a decline in the real value of commodities and rural exports; an increase in real value in elaborately manufactured and value added products; Australia's decreasing share of the world trading market over the past 50 years; and  Australia's inability to fundamentally reshape our strategic position to improve our access rights to world markets and consequently improve our national living standards through real economic growth rather than short&hyphen;term borrowing. Australia's position in the trading world is disastrously low and has historically been so. Results of this kind illustrate an inability to compete with the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has long depended on our natural resources. Commodity exports had for many years been a sole source of international income. In the fifties and sixties this provided Australia with a rosy future. However, the world market has changed but Australia has not changed with it. Agriculture and mining, traditionally Australia's domain, have decreased in the relative return they provide to Australia. High export return now stems from manufacturing and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the period 1980 to 1995, there was a significant change in Australia's trading priorities. High return areas of manufacturing and services have seen an increase in the total aggregate of net exports rise to approximately 40 per cent. In comparison, South&hyphen;East Asian nations far exceed this. Australia's challenge is to further improve on this 40 per cent. South&hyphen;East Asian nations have turned natural resource disadvantages into advantages by creating value added industries and structuring their economies towards saving and investment rather than borrowing. The result has been a greater ability for research and development and a larger pool of financial resources for government to assist industry and business to compete in the world marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This increasing reliance by Australia on agriculture and mining has produced a decline in Australia's export share of the world market from 1.3 per cent in 1989 to 1.1 per cent in 1995. These results are embarrassing for Australia. In global terms, we can hardly justify our place at the negotiating table. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Highly respected journalist Greg Sherridan argues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">. . . Australia is a nation of declining relevance in global trade.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">We are falling further and further behind.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">While these are accurate reflections of the current state of affairs, they are not the real bite from Mr Sherridan. This comes in the following analysis. Mr Sherridan argues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In Opposition, Fischer and the Coalition claimed that the only way to evaluate national export success in Asia was by measuring market share . . . </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">But having made that the very centrepiece of their approach in Opposition, they have not bothered to include market share figures for key Asian markets in this trade statement.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Fischer proudly boasts that Australia's rural exports were increased by 15 per cent. The National Party relies on this figure to provide support for their argument within the government that a commodities rural sector is and should continue to be the government's priority in trading terms. The point he is missing is that this is an increase in a declining market with a declining dollar value to Australia's exporting performance and position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fairness, the point about declining value for the agricultural and mining sector is not just lost on Mr Fischer. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) has also joined the chorus. In a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> edition in January, John Anderson stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia should focus more on improving its exports of raw materials rather than developing processing industries.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">It is likely that improving the quality of our raw materials will become much more important than value adding.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These comments go against world trends for the last 50 years. There is no better example of the problems facing Australian industry and trade policy than the comments and myths which are given voice by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and clearly abide within the government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="545">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trend figures for the period 1980 to 1995 clearly show that for Australia there has been a reduced level of international trade in agriculture and a significantly increased level for manufactures. What this means is that we as a nation are getting less for more. We may be acquiring more and more of the market, but it is a shrinking market with lesser returns. For Mr Anderson's constituency, this means less return for capital investment and a decline in living standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister for primary industries does his constituency no favours by delaying the inevitable. By not accepting this fact now, his natural constituency will suffer severe reductions in return and living standards when the world forces Australia to accept the reality of declining return for commodities. This means that the benefits of trade liberalisation are to be experienced in the value added sectors, particularly elaborately transformed manufactures and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even within the primary sector there is a shift away from the rural sector to the mining sector. By 2001-02, mining will account for 50 to 65 per cent of our export trade in the primary sector. The trade statement was an opportunity for the government to dispel these myths and set a strategic path designed to increase our share of the export growth areas such as value adding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my home state of Western Australia, there has been some attempt to improve on the value added side of mineral exports. In Western Australia it is reported that there is a boom in the industrial minerals industry. Mr Anderson would probably point to this as vindication of his comments. He should, however, read the report carefully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review by the Western Australian resources department reports that the value of industrial minerals to the production of minerals in Western Australia is nearly 12 per cent. This is an increase from 7&half; per cent in 1985. The crucial point here is the usage of industrial minerals. Their use is in ceramics, plastic, refractories, glass, paint, chemical industries and paper, among many others. All are value adding industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, while this value adding has seen a five per cent increase in industrial minerals to total 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mineral production, the real proof of the benefit of value adding is in the dollar term increases. In 1985, 1.72 million tonnes of products were produced. They were priced at $87 per tonne with a total value of $149 million. In 1995 there had been an increase in production of only 19 per cent. However, through the success of value adding, the price increased to $420 per tonne from $87 per tonne to a total value of $860 million. Thus, in mineral production in Western Australia, value adding is providing a higher return for investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, while the industry is doing its part to move towards high growth export orientated goods, the government's lack of strategic policy is hindering the process from booming even further. Essential to the industrial minerals sector is energy policy. The real issue here is the quality of gas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state government has rigidity requirements which allow about only 20 per cent of the state's gas reserves to pass through the pipeline from Dampier to Bunbury. What is required is a pipeline for industrial quality gas. This gas, if provided through a pipeline other than the state owned one from Dampier to Bunbury, will be accessible at prices lower than gas from the trunk line. The result will be a cost advantage to the Australian industrial minerals sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of this case is that government policy must be strategic, forward looking and integrated. Energy policy is extremely important to the Western Australian minerals sector. If these policies are integrated with industry and trade policy, comparative advantages with the rest of the world will appear. It is these comparative advantages which result in efficiencies and a greater capacity to compete in our access markets and create new ones. Integrated policies help take the step from natural resources to value adding and export growth. A reliance on commodities alone is useless. So too are policies dealing only with parts of an overall industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the figures I have mentioned about Australia's trading position are not enough to alarm senators, then I further point to the mid&hyphen;year economic and fiscal outlook 1996-97 brought down by the Treasurer, Mr 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="546"> Costello. The government has forecast that the net export contribution to national economic growth is a negative quarter per cent. By comparison, in the period 1995-96 the figure was a positive one per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note what this increasing share of a declining market will mean for Australia over the next decade. Exports equal growth and growth equals jobs. The Australian population is not large enough to consume Australian manufacturing. Our products must be sold overseas. This is where growth will occur and so will jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With a negative contribution to economic growth from exports, the job prospects look bleak. The problems facing Australian trade require an aggressive approach designed to assist Australian industries and, in particular, firms internationalise themselves. The policies required must be pro&hyphen;active and designed to create and improve comparative advantages for our firms. We must do more than just assist firms to respond to world markets and trends. The government has too heavy a reliance on world growth and trends. It should be creating policies that will provide advantages for firms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In chapter four of the trade statement, the government  argues that world growth trends bode well for Australia and will create an increase in net exports to national growth. Successful trade policies require more than just a preparedness to respond to world trends and events. Aggressive policies which give comparative advantages will assist with high net export growth exceeding the world average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, if these comparative advantages continue, this type of growth should be sustainable in times of a world slowdown. Reliance on world trends, as chapter 4 of the document advocates, will only result in figures corresponding with world trends. The problem with Australian trade policy is that we allow the world to dictate the environment in which we work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems that arise with a reliance on world trends to steer export growth rather than policies to set our own direction lie in the admission in chapter 4 of the document that: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's total market share has fallen because the composition of world imports has shifted into areas where Australia has a lower total market share.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Australian policy makers should have seen this coming through the study of world trends. Appropriately, government should design and direct policy to ensure that we are not a victim of world trends but a beneficiary. Support for research and development and new industry initiatives will result in new innovations and new markets. By government encouragement through financial assistance and appropriate policy for these pursuits, we provide ourselves with the best opportunity to set our goals and not be the victim of outdated policies destroyed because of world trends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those areas where there is government assistance, they are largely the continuation of the former government's policies. For example, after much pressure from the ALP, the government decided to retain the ships bounty introduced by the former Labor government. The ships bounty was a program which contributed towards a high growth export orientated industry. The program contributed to a growth rate of 200 per cent, exports by 150 per cent and employment levels by 50 per cent since its inception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government was prepared to slash this program, which would result in the loss of jobs and export dollars, for a saving of a lousy $3 million. The fact that the government was going to cut the bounty is indicative of their policy position: let the market work it out. The fact that they rescinded the decision after pressure from the ALP and the community is indicative of their political position: keep quiet and do not move until we are caught.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does not appear to fully understand the relationship that has occurred in South&hyphen;East Asian nations between government support for industry and firm success. Maximising Australia's trading position means doing what this report fails to mention. We must implement policies which encourage innovation, which support industry and provide comparative advantages with world trading partners, and which ensure trade and industry policy is strategic and integrated to

Of that tiny area, about 55,000 hectares have already been clear&hyphen;felled and only 53,000 hectares, or 29 per cent, are protected in secure conservation reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The old&hyphen;growth karri forest is being rapidly wiped out. Under existing plans, only a minute vestige of the original glory of that karri forest will remain. This is the planned fate of what is a world famous karri forest, a forest that people already do and increasingly will travel from all around the globe to experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to preface my comments by noting that soon after becoming the federal Minister for the Environment, our Senate colleague Senator Hill was treated by local people to an excursion through the forest that is subject to this talk. I understand that there is a sense of deep grievance and disappointment in the minister's apparent casual disregard for their concerns since.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1982, the West Australian Environment Protection Authority asked Professor Peter Attiwell to write a report on karri forest conservation in WA. In his report, Professor 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Attiwell identified the importance of Giblett block and adjacent old&hyphen;growth karri forests and stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Such an area of extensive and concentrated karri forest should be of high priority for conservation.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In 1992, a further assessment was conducted, this time by the Australian Heritage Commission. As a result of this study, Giblett was found to be worthy of National Estate listing and is currently interim listed on the Register of the National Estate. The 1992 AHC report on the values of the Giblett forest clearly shows that, by any measure, this is a most important area of forest. In 1995, the Giblett forest block was included in the areas of forest placed under moratorium by the state and Commonwealth governments as part of the deferred forest agreement process. That moratorium recognised the importance of this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the national forest policy statement and the deferred forest agreement, which this government claims to be complying with in carrying out the regional forest agreement process, high conservation value forests like Giblett are supposed to remain under a moratorium pending the completion of full regional assessments and the implementation of the promised `comprehensive, adequate and representative' forest conservation reserve system. Instead, in a cynical move last year the Howard and Court coalition governments did a deal whereby Giblett forest and other high conservation value National Estate listed forests will be sacrificed&mdash;I use that emotive term deliberately&mdash;to clear&hyphen;felling and woodchipping in 1997. This abhorrent deal clearly breaches the national forest policy and clearly pre-empts and undermines the regional forest agreement process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year, the proposal for the creation of the Greater Beedelup National Park was written and launched by Pemberton community representatives and endorsed by many local tourism industry operators. I stress that that has been launched locally. The proposed park would increase the size of the existing Beedelup National Park from a meagre 1,500 hectares&mdash;I remind you that this parliament sits on about 50 hectares, so it is only 300 times the size of this&mdash;to 19,000 hectares, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="548"> which would be a much more manageable park and would thus provide a viable and sustainable resource base for the rapidly growing eco&hyphen;tourism industry and nature based tourism industry in the Pemberton district. That tourism industry already has something like 70,000 visitors a year to that park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to allow the destruction of Giblett forest block and adjacent National Estate forests means that the enormous potential value of the national park is being ignored and the needs of the tourism industry will again be overlooked in favour of the insatiable greed, as it seems to me to be, of the woodchip industry. Let me be a little bit sharp, because I say that WA woodchip companies make huge donations to the coalition parties and the tourism operators do not. I would hope that is not what is weighing on the minds of the people who make these decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such outcomes make a complete mockery of the regional forest agreement process. Fortunately, it is not too late for the Commonwealth government to correct a serious breach of trust by accessing funds set aside in the forest industry structural adjustment package, which I understand runs to over $100 million. The Commonwealth can assist the WA government and the native forest logging industry to defer any logging within the proposed national park pending a full and open assessment of this national park proposal. The funds in this package are in part specifically designated for this type of use. There is no reason why they cannot be used now to compensate the timber industry and to allow breathing space so that studies can be conducted into the proposal for the creation of a world-class Greater Beedelup National Park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Upon signing the disastrous regional forest agreement with the Victorian government this week&mdash;there are many of us who think it was not good enough&mdash;the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made much of the supposed benefits of the agreement for rural and regional communities. Turning it around, if the Prime Minister and the Minister for Environment have any regard for the well&hyphen;being of the rural 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and regional communities of south-west Western Australia who support this forest park, they must act now to ensure that the planned destruction of Giblett block is deferred and that the Greater Beedelup National Park proposal is given full and open consideration. I seek leave to table the proposal of the Pemberton community for the creation of the Greater Beedelup National Park.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1917, one of the most memorable feats of Australian courage took place in the Battle of Beersheba, where Australian troops secured key positions facilitating the capture of Gaza. The performance of the Australian Light Horse is synonymous with valour and audacity and has been immortalised by our storytellers and filmmakers and is writ large in the hearts of all Australians today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As one of the first tests of a newly federated nation, the Great War saw the hearts of all Australian men beat as one for the first time in defence of their country. Thousands willingly made the greatest sacrifice for their country and, when the conflict was over, those that survived lent their valour and audacity to their home ground, stimulating the development of a free and prosperous Australia. In war and in peace those soldiers were heroes and we honour their legend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to trace today the family of one of those Australians who took part in the Battle of Beersheba. In 1921, the returned soldier purchased a property near Blackall. Through drought, flood, fire, war and depression, his family has continued to live and work the property for four generations. The old man who fought for the freedom of his country and his descendants is buried there on the property. There have been other burials, and there have been weddings and the christening of new life as the seasons have come and gone. There have been 76 years of human drama and 76 years of the battles and the less frequent triumphs of family farming.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="549">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the country known to host Banjo Paterson. This is the country haunted by Henry Lawson. This country resonates with the shearers' strikes and the formation of the Australian Labor Party. This is the outback. Other countries also have their beaches, their mountain ranges, their tall buildings and their theme parks. But only Australia has the unique cultural and economic heritage afforded by the families who have lived and continue to live west of the Divide; families whose strong personal attachments to the land have been forged in isolation from the big cities their toil has done so much to support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to make the point about that economic heritage. When the patriarch of this family bought out at Blackall, it was part of a progression. His father and brothers had started in the Darling Downs and then moved further and further out in the natural evolution of nation building that has led us to where we are today. It is for these families that I speak today&mdash;not for the large corporations, the multinationals, who will always have powerful voices to put their case and negotiate self&hyphen;serving outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to paint in words a still life of what these families are experiencing as a result of the Wik decision on native title. It may be that their fears and concerns can be allayed, but no-one is yet in a situation to give them any certainty and so their fears cannot but continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several members and senators have received a letter from Mrs Lindsay MacDonald, who is in a family partnership in a grazing homestead perpetual lease near Blackall. This family are the descendants of the Light Horseman who fought at the Battle of Beersheba. They are typical of many families and their reactions to native title typify the reaction of thousands of farming families west of the Divide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mrs MacDonald wrote that their family's Charleville property, purchased for drought management purposes, was the subject of a native title claim and that they were participating in a mediation process. Their lease was one of 3,000 affected by the claim. Since that letter, she was informed via a radio broadcast that a second claim had been filed by another 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Aboriginal group. Neither of the two claims were made by local Aborigines. The second claim covers 11 Queensland shires and claims the flora and fauna and the artesian and sub&hyphen;artesian waters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Blackall property also is under claim, despite the fact that when it was purchased in 1921 there were no Aboriginal people in the area with any connection to this lease&mdash;for some time previously and none since.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ATSIC regional councillors from Rockhampton have been telling local Aborigines that they are now co&hyphen;owners of pastoral leases. The concerns of families like the MacDonalds are many. Firstly, they believed the leaders of the day, who told them that pastoral leases would extinguish native title. Mrs MacDonald writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">We have been alarmed by the backing away from this solidly given commitment by the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Aboriginal leadership of the time, and feel we have been betrayed.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They cannot understand how Aborigines who have no physical contact with the claimed land can make a claim which engages the leaseholder in the process of native title before the rightness of the claim itself is assessed. They are perplexed by the overlapping of the claims, how to deal with each, and the extensive time and cost involved, whether the claim is established or not. They are bewildered by a system which advocates mediation when it is only at the court stage that the claimants are required to provide proof of connection to the claimed lease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the mediation process, lessees are encouraged to concede perceived rights to claimants before there is even proof as to the legitimacy of the claim. This feels like extortion to them. They are confused by the new language of economic empowerment through native title. They thought it was just about traditional activities such as hunting and ceremonies. Unlike the few who have long&hyphen;established protocols for a form of access, most farming families have no history of coexistence with Aboriginal people on their lease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The massive claims under discussion mean also that leaseholders have no prior knowledge of or even acquaintance with the people making the claim. They are not locals or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="550"> known to anyone in the district. It should be realised by the leafy suburb intellectuals in this country that the prospect of sitting around a table with someone you have never heard of, who claims to co&hyphen;own what you always had been led to believe was yours, is an understandably frightening prospect. We cannot leave them on their own. As Lindsay MacDonald put it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">We feel we are in an insane situation, and cannot believe our country has put us in this position.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Imagine hearing on the media that a group of people has lodged a claim using the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">. . . to be entitled as against the whole world to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the claimed land.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Imagine then ringing the Native Title Tribunal and being told not to worry about the words used because it is just legalese. The tribunal is doing just that&mdash;advising farmers not to take notice of legalese.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where do you go? There is a multitude of legal opinions floating around&mdash;which one is accurate? And as far as not taking notice of the legalese goes, any lessee would do that at their own peril, for the tortuous path of legalese is what got us there in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are also most anxious about the possibility of their rights and leases being restricted to pastoral activities. For several years now, with the drought, terms of trade and high interest rates, it has been common practice for farming families to require supplementary income to ensure their survival. They do all manner of innovative things to keep food on the table. They are concerned about what coexistence would mean to these activities which would go to the viability of their overall enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their concerns do not float around in the lofty world of ideas but address specific problems. Already, the Queensland land department has stopped accepting the full payment to freehold farms and has refused to grant permits to Crown land use because of the Wik ruling. This has the effect of putting contracts and jobs at risk, putting question marks on valuations and postponing development processes. These are the sorts of ques 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tions which need answers and deserve answers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the coalface of life in the bush, farmers and graziers want to know these things: does coexistence mean shared local government rates and shared cost of property roads?  What about legal liability for injuries and insurance? How are native title holders to be identified? What notification of entry would be required? What rights exist if agreements are breached? How will property management and development be affected? What will happen to equity and interest rates and how will this upset viability? Should lessees be compensated? How will it work if claimants negotiate with mining companies but lessees cannot?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These questions are the nitty&hyphen;gritty of the Wik legacy. They may even sound a bit sordid to the shining&hyphen;eyed idealist who would give everything away so long as it was not in his backyard. However, it is important for this parliament to hear the anguish, the confusion, the wariness and the disbelief of families west of the Divide. Decisions cannot be made without cognisance of their concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is irresponsible to say, as ATSIC commissioner Geoff Clark said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> on Wednesday, 29 January, that `Aboriginal groups are now partners in any economic, or any development, in Australia because of the recognition of our property rights and common law rights'. It has reached a stage in the west where the descendants of the heroes&mdash;the holders of unique Australian lore and culture&mdash;fear that their contribution is to be submerged, belittled and even obliterated to pay a debt not of their own making. No doubt this sounds extreme to many, but I am a faithful messenger. This is a crisis for leaseholders&mdash;beyond drought, beyond banks and beyond commodity prices.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="550"><TITLE>Condolences: Mr Brett Seaman</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Brett was a tireless campaigner during elections, working hard to achieve what he strongly believed in&mdash;social justice and equity in Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Brett Seaman commenced work as an industrial officer and organiser with the ACT branch of the Community and Public Sector Union in 1992. He again was a dedicated organiser who consistently chalked up results for the members.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, Brett returned to the union movement as an industrial officer with the Australian Nursing Federation. He was respected by nurses in both the public and private sectors, and did the bulk of the work in negotiating the current ACT government nurses' enterprise agreement, which has substantially improved relations between the government and nurses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Brett recruited and converted many members to the union movement and the ALP. He stood fearlessly by what he believed in and never shied away from an argument or dispute when his beliefs were questioned.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Austudy means test was changed essentially to stop the asset rich, cash poor and high income earners from abusing the system by artificially manipulating their financial situation in order to become eligible for Austudy. That is quite an honourable position to try and achieve. The intention was that the alteration would ensure Austudy was available for those who genuinely qualified for it and for the financially disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened, though, is that the government has made it so complicated that, in so far as the assessment process appears to work, it is now excluding people who were eligible last year and whose circumstances have not changed. It is creating all sorts of difficulties for students, either due to the period of time for enrolment and the time schedules they need to meet or in the filling out of the forms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer to one of the many students who have contacted my office. I will read a letter from the father of this student, Kim Allen. It is the letter he sent to the

During 1997 a trust company was formed to hold any patents which might eventuate from the research, because I could not pay for them myself.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are two fairly simple questions which the Austudy hotline office has been unable to answer. I suppose the question for the govern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="553"> ment really is this: given that you continue to claim that you champion the cause of small business, surely you ought to be able to come out with an answer as a government, and the minister, Senator Vanstone, ought to be able to explain how we can solve these problems, because they clearly are problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as though the government does not know. As I understand it, there have been some 60,000 phone calls to the Austudy hotline. The government clearly knows about it. You have only to look at what is written in the newspapers to really come to grips with this issue. The application goes in and gets refused. The student does not have the money either to continue or to begin their university education. They are told they need a review, and the review process can take up to six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sort of a situation is that for them? Most are already having to enrol for the dole. I suppose there might be a position where some of them end up on the dole. Then, all of a sudden, while they are trying to sort out this mess with regards to their review, and whether they are finally going to start, or continue, their university education, they get involved in the compulsory work for the dole scheme. In that sort of a situation, they could not begin to look at even part&hyphen;time education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the minister and the government have a very big and urgent responsibility to provide answers to these people, and not only in terms of the hotline. My colleagues and I are getting a number of complaints, and I know that the letter really just mirrors one of the many phone calls that we have received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may well be that the change had an honourable objective and, of course, we would and did support the change in so far as it applied to people trying to rort the system, if that were the case. But clearly, there is a problem in terms of income assessment, whereby people, even if they have borrowed money, have it counted as income. And, of course, we have somehow got this national averaging in terms of certain aspects of what will be assessed. In Mr Allen's case, it related to transport costs and that, apparently, came from the ABS. But what was it assessed on? Clearly, there will be differences around this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> country with regard to cost of living and, clearly, in terms of transport, in Tasmania the costs will be less than they will be in some other states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a ridiculous situation. We have seen no action from the government and no explanation from the minister. The minister and the government and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) say that they are the champions of small business and that they do not want to see young people on the dole. They say that they want them to make a responsible contribution. And yet they have put a means test in place that is clearly disadvantaging young people that want to go to university and cannot because of this whole process of a bungled means test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Yet there is no government action. I think that the government ought, forthwith, to address this question urgently, and I hope that the minister will take on board the concerns of the many tens of thousands of students and their parents. And, particularly because they are in the area of small business, this government ought to give it a paramount position in terms of taking some action to resolve the problems. If they do not, many of these kids will not get to go to university, or will not be able to continue their studies. I hope that the government senators here who seem very interested in this matter will take it on board and pursue their minister to do something about it.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="553"><TITLE>Ministerial Response</TITLE>

Is it also a fact that the government has refused to supplement the $33,000 that it will cost to upgrade Senator Colston's staff position? Has the Department of Finance offered to extend the Senate department's capacity to borrow from next year's budget to fund the $171,000 shortfall that this has created? Fourthly, given that the Senate has to forgo $171,000 from next year's budget, what cuts to senators' services are likely to result from this shortfall?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

In relation to the first one, there was a refusal, but it was contained in a letter from the Minister for Finance, not the Department of Finance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> release of the latest CPI figures in the midyear review show that Australia has decisively entered a low inflation era. How does low inflation contribute to a low interest rate, high investment environment and create the jobs needed to tackle the unacceptably high unemployment rates left by the Labor government after 13 years? Is there any further good news to report on recent developments in home mortgage rates?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="554" SPEAKER="Kemp, Sen Rod" NAMEID="WW4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Assistant Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator is quite right when she says that the latest CPI figures show that Australia has decisively entered a low inflation environment. Australia now enjoys one of the lowest inflation environments in the world. Our inflation rate is well below the OECD average. The so-called all groups CPI rose by 0.2 per cent in the December quarter of last year. It is the lowest quarterly rise since the December quarter of 1993. The three&hyphen;year growth was 1.5 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last time Australia experienced inflation rates this low was in the early 1990s when the economy was in recession. The maintenance of low inflation over this cycle suggests that Australia has returned to an inflation performance not seen since the 1960s. The December quarter CPI is consistent with the midyear review that headline inflation will be just one per cent in 1996-97 and underlying inflation in the order of two per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Low inflation is good for jobs. I would have thought that the Labor Party would have welcomed these low inflation figures. The tragedy for the opposition is that they hate good news. This is a singular group of Australians who seem to hate good news on the economic front. Low inflation is good news. It is good news for jobs, it promotes sound and balanced investment decisions, it provides certainty for business in making decisions on wages and prices and it particularly helps older households by protecting the real value of savings. Of course, low inflation is a prerequisite for low interest rates. Low interest rates are simply not sustainable unless inflation is low. Low inflation and a responsible fiscal strategy have sliced 1.5 per cent off official interest rates since the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, you asked me whether there is any good news on the mortgage home interest rate

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes; perhaps we might get more enlightenment if I proceed, Madam President. The fact is that I think Senator Schacht is accurately quoting our policy contained in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better communications</EMPHASIS>  document released at the last election. Beyond that point, there is no proposal currently before the government. Until we see such a proposal, of course it is entirely premature to be ruling out or giving directions or any such thing. If a proposal comes forward in due course and it clearly contradicts our election proposals, it will not go ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just in case Senator Schacht thinks that there is a formal proposal there, let us look at what he said in his press release. He managed to extend himself to about 15 lines yesterday 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="556"> in the press release he put out, and it starts off by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor opposition believes that Telstra is about to introduce . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is not a very sound policy basis for the government to make decisions on, I wouldn't have thought. Most people have not got a clue what Labor believes these days&mdash;whether you are still chasing the chardonnay or cappuccino vote, which basically props you up these days, having given the battlers away. Why should we treat your beliefs on these issues as any sort of policy basis?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the draft press release I have seen from Telstra says that it is only an informal proposal at this stage and Telstra is keen to discuss all aspects of the proposal with consumer groups before presenting a formal proposal to the government. Quite clearly there could be a lot of water to go under the bridge before we get anywhere near a formal commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is of course that Senator Schacht was actually given information about these proposals yesterday and had all the time in the world to absorb the detail of it. But what do we get? Not a mention of the fact that this service is growing by 20 to 25 per cent a year&mdash;more than 400 million calls out there.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did I say we did not make the promise? All of those problems were just skated over by poor, old Senator Schacht, who of course was the one who told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  on 29 June last year that he delights in opposition because there is no more paperwork involved. He said, `Some of us were never overly sucked in by the cabinet process,' and I think I reminded him at the time that he was not actually in cabinet; but he obviously empathised with his colleagues who were actually doing the hard work. Nonetheless, he felt `there was too much time 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> spent debating the minutiae', as he called it, `of administration and not enough pure politics'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is certainly pretty evident from the interview you managed to give to Liz Jackson today. You went on 2CN.

Liz Jackson asked you, `Isn't it a fact that many of the people who use this service use it at work?' Of course, this was essentially a policy proposition; so the best Senator Schacht could do was to say, `And a lot of people use it at home, too.' In other words, he refused to address the issues. It is no wonder that people in the industry are talking about you as a low impact facility. It is a very serious situation.

What action will you now take to ensure the protection of this environmentally significant area?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should remind Senator Margetts that the AHC, the Australian Heritage Commission, is an independent statutory authority. I am not sure whether she is inviting me to take an action of political intervention in this matter, but I will set that aside for the moment. I thought I said on the last occasion that the basis of the action was that there had been some procedural deficiencies in the listing process by the AHC. In other words, as I understood it, it was very much a case being made on a technical point. I think I probably said on the last occasion that I was somewhat unimpressed with two statutory authorities spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money in fighting each other over a technicality. Certainly I was so unimpressed that I had asked my then parliamentary secretary, Senator Campbell, to see whether he could use his good offices to bring 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="563"> about a sensible resolution without seeking to interfere in the statutory role of either authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was hinted at by the senator, what has happened is that in December the two parties applied to, and obtained from, the Federal Court an order to the effect that the AHC's decision of 12 February to enter parts of Perth airport on the Register of the National Estate had ceased to be effective. The order of 23 December 1996 means that the areas of Perth airport are not included from that date in the Register of the National Estate on the register's interim list. I understand the AHC decided to take this step to bring to a conclusion lengthy litigation which was leading nowhere and costing an enormous amount of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that the AHC settled the proceedings on the basis that it did not in any way concede that the commission's decision involved any error in law.

How will the Australian people be expected to differentiate between the Prime Minister's promises and those made in his name by the apparatchiks at Robert Menzies House?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GX5">Senator TROETH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Minister, the Howard government's work for the dole initiative has been well received by the Australian public. They believe young Australians should be given the opportunity to make a contribution in return for their dole payments. The extent to which Labor is out of touch with mainstream Australia has been shown in its opposition to this proposal. The media has reported in recent days that the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has published a report rejecting the concept of work for the dole. Are these reports true? If not, can the minister correct the record?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="564" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Troeth, through you Madam President, for that question. There was a report referred to on the ABC. That report was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Volunteering in Australia</EMPHASIS> . It was actually undertaken and published by ACOSS. The purpose of the report was to investigate that use of voluntary&mdash;that is unpaid&mdash;work as a pathway to some type of paid employment. The report was not about work for the dole. Work for the dole is about being paid award rates for hourly work done up to the value of your dole payment. The report in question makes no recommendations at all on the subject of work for the dole. None at all. The report does state that some organisations would not want to provide or be capable of providing an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="565"> appropriate pathway from unemployment to voluntary work to paid unemployment. However, that is completely irrelevant to the government's work for the dole scheme and the reason for that is that the government will be inviting proposals from interested organisations, not those which are not interested, not those which do not want to be involved and not those which are not capable of providing what is required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work for the dole we believe will contribute towards breaking the cycle of despondency and despair experienced primarily by young unemployed Australians. We believe that it will give them some work experience and let them make a contribution back to the community. The proposal has the overwhelming support of the community: 95 per cent of those responding to a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> phone poll on this issue were in favour of the scheme. You can attribute a significant degree of error to a phone poll&mdash;I understand that&mdash;but it does not matter where you go from 95 per cent; you are going to end up with a very significant majority in favour of the work for the dole proposal to trial about 30 pilots around Australia. As Senator Troeth rightly says, Labor's kneejerk reaction against this proposal and its refusal to see if this might make a difference and a contribution is just another example of their having created a mess and having no policies and no ideas about how to fix that mess. Their opposition to this shows just how out of touch with the community they really are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, it is no surprise to me that Senator Faulkner is now on his feet and turning his back to me, because I suspect that he knows what I am about to say. I believe that Senator Faulkner recently raised this report in the chamber. If he was referring to another one, I would be very happy for him to tell me about it. In his usual smug way, he wanted to infer, through a question, that my department had published such a report, when we had not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can only assume that Senator Faulkner heard this on ABC radio and, having no ideas on policies and no ideas on questions, thought he would give it a run. I remind him that there are a lot of parents of Australian sailors 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who once thought their kids were in trouble in the Gulf War because the ABC ran a report that one of our destroyers had some collision. It turned out that the ABC had heard that from a Sydney cabbie. I do not know whether Senator Faulkner has a better source for his questions. Perhaps he has got this report but inquiries by my department have not been able to find it. What he did was come in here and pretend that there was a report opposed to work for the dole, when he should have known that that was not the case.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Newman&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(a) Rather than referring all Defence activity proposals to the department responsible for the environment for decision regarding potential significance, the then Environment Minister and the then Minister for Defence agreed to a Memorandum of Understanding which was signed on 28 August 1991 which states that the decision as to whether a Defence proposal or activity is likely to affect the environment to a significant extent, may be taken by the Minister for Defence or his/her Ministry. This administrative procedure is consistent with the requirements of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposal) Act 1974 which charges the action Minister to determine if a proposal should be referred to the Environment Minister. To assist Defence in assessing the significance of the affect of a Defence proposal on the environment, the Ministers agreed on broad guidelines. On the basis of these guidelines, it was agreed that if, `after full and proper consideration, taking into account all relevant environmental implications', Defence considered the environment would not be affected to a significant extent, the provisions of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 would be satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The Department of Defence, in agreement with the Environment Minister in 1980, introduced the Environmental Certificate of Compliance as a means of ensuring that the Department meets, and discharges its responsibilities, for environmental assessment under the provisions of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. The Environmental Certificate of Compliance is signed by the Department of Defence delegate when satisfied that all environmental aspects of a proposal have been adequately investigated, and that the action is not an environmentally significant action. The Environmental Certificate of Compliance conforms to Defence's requirements under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 and therefore does not require referral to the Minister responsible for the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, this Certificate allows for conditions to be placed on the proposal that must be strictly adhered to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) The Assistant Secretary Resources and Project Management is the Departmental delegate responsible for approving and ensuring Exercise Tandem Thrust 97 is conducted in compliance with the conditions set in the Environmental Certificate of Compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a) and (b) A mixture of Australian Navy, Army and Air Force, and US Army, Navy, Marine and Air Force personnel will be based in Townsville (1,824), Rockhampton (1,280), Gladstone (937) and Amberley/Brisbane (1,134) during the exercise. These numbers are for the peak period 10-22 March 1997. Numbers will begin to build from mid February, with all personnel departing by the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="569"> end of March 1997. Up to two thirds of these personnel may be granted leave outside of normal working hours. A maximum of 8,609 personnel from all services will be located in the Shoalwater Bay Training Area (SWBTA) in the peak period 10-22 March 1997. It is unlikely any of these personnel will be granted leave during this period. 13,126 Australian and US Navy personnel will be at sea during the exercise (all figures quoted in this paragraph are expected estimates, but are subject to change prior to and during the exercise). The personnel on ships at sea will conduct goodwill visits to Australian ports before and/or after the exercise. The ship visit program is still being developed and therefore, arrival and departure dates have yet to be resolved. However, ships will be dispersed amongst ports to reduce the impact of the visits and spread the economic benefits to a number of communities. It is anticipated US Navy ships will visit Cairns, Brisbane, Sydney, Townsville, Hobart and Fremantle. The largest port visit is likely to be conducted by five US Navy ships to Sydney, a city well used to, and capable of, hosting this number of ships. Four Australian Navy ships will be conducting post exercise visits to Gladstone, Cairns and Brisbane. Up to two thirds of a ship's company may be granted leave at any one time during these visits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) With one exception, all activities associated with Exercise Tandem Thrust have been conducted in the SWBTA in the past. The new activity is to exercise the US Maritime Pre-Positioning Force (MPF). This will involve the off load of MPF equipment and supplies at Freshwater Beach in the SWBTA, including the pumping of freshwater from a ship at anchor to the beach. This activity has not been conducted before in the SWBTA as the Australian Defence Force (ADF) does not possess this capability. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Queensland Department of the Environment conducted a feasibility study and comprehensive survey to determine the viability and preferred location for the conduct of the activity. It has also been briefed to the SWBTA Environmental Management Advisory Committee and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. All bodies involved and consulted have agreed to the conduct of this activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)(a) Exercise Tandem Thrust 97 is indeed a significant exercise, however, it is not the largest exercise to have been conducted in the SWBTA. Numerous Brigade and higher level exercises, and joint/combined exercises, have been conducted at SWBTA since June 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The Kangaroo Exercises were referred to the EPA under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. On the basis of information provided to the EPA by the Department of Defence, and in accordance with paragraph 3.1.1(a) of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Administrative Procedures, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories determined that neither a Public Environment Report nor an Environmental Impact Statement was necessary. The information provided to the EPA was prepared in consultation with the Australian Nature Conservation Agency, the Australian Heritage Commission, the Queensland Department of Environment (previously Environment and Heritage), the Western Australian Department of Environmental Protection, and the Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory. The provisions of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 were satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)(a) and (b) The Exercise Plan and the subsequent Annex T (Environmental Annex) are United States documents, ie issued by the United States Exercise Executive (Commander Seventh Fleet) to Exercise participants, and includes some reference to operations. These documents are not normally released, however, I am happy to provide the Senate with the Executive Summary to the Environmental Assessment which includes the safeguarding measures in respect to the Exercise (this document is attached at Annex A).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Exercise Tandem Thrust is a free play operational and tactical level exercise, where freedom of manoeuvre is essential for units to gain full value from the activity. The movement of the US submarine has not been pre-scripted and a definitive answer to this question cannot be given. It is, however, the nature of nuclear-powered submarine operations to avoid shallow or navigationally constricted waters. Additionally, the Australian Government has imposed restrictions on the use of most anti-submarine sensors within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Exercise planners have consequentially designed the majority of the submarine activities to be well clear of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) Every port in Australia has a general plan which would apply in the unlikely event of an accident involving any conventional and nuclear powered foreign warship. The risk, however, of a major collision involving a foreign warship in an Australian port is considered to be very remote because of navigation practices and port restrictions on shipping movements. So remote are the risks, the Department of Defence assesses the chances of a contained accident occurring at less than 1 in 10,000 years, and the chances of an accident involving the release of radioactive material to be far more remote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) Yes (the map is attached at Annex B).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) The Australian Government does not have definitive information on this aspect of nuclear-powered submarine operations. In any event, it is not anticipated that the US nuclear-powered submarine will be operating in less than 50 fathoms 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="570"> of water during the exercise. Both Australia and the US have stringent safety procedures to minimise any risk for the environment and for its personnel. US nuclear-powered ships and submarines have visited over 150 ports in over 50 countries around the world without experiencing a reactor accident of any sort that resulted in the release of radioactive material. Both the US and Australian Governments have complete confidence in these units and in the personnel who operate them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10)(a) and (b) The Environmental Monitoring Group (EMG) will assist in achieving the successful conduct of Exercise Tandem Thrust 97, by providing specialist and expert local environmental advice in support of Exercise Commanders and participating Units. The EMG will have both US and Australian components. The Head of the EMG will be the Director of Environment and Heritage from the Department of Defence, who will be the liaison point between the US and Australian components and the Combined Exercise Control Group. The EMG will be responsible for providing expert environmental advice, conducting environmental inspections before, during and after Exercise Tandem Thrust 97, responding to reported environmental incidents, and to be the key liaison point between the Exercise Commanders and the external stake holders. The EMG will be staffed by six US representatives and four Australian representatives. The US contingent will consist of environmental management specialists, with expertise in facilities engineering, hazardous waste management, hazardous materials management, land and sea oil spill management, and ground water and soil investigation. The Australian contingent will include the Director of Environment and Heritage from the Department of Defence, the SWBTA Environmental Management Officer, a South Queensland Logistics Group Engineer, and an expert on SWBTA from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. In addition, there will be constant liaison as required with representatives from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Queensland Department of the Environment, and a local civil engineering firm, prior to, during and after Exercise Tandem Thrust 97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11)(a) Australia and the US are expected to have an estimated 5,500 personnel and 20,500 respectively that will participate in the exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) No countries other than Australia and the US will be participating in this exercise (this includes observers).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(12) There is no intention for the US to preposition equipment in Australia as a result of Exercise Tandem Thrust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(13)(a) One Los Angeles Class nuclear-powered submarine will participate in the exercise. It is US policy to neither confirm, nor deny, the carriage of nuclear weapons on US naval ships. The Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Government accepts this policy and does not require the US to disclose whether nuclear weapons are on board their visiting warships. The Government is satisfied that the standards required by NATO countries, with respect to nuclear weapons safety, and with the safety precautions taken on board visiting warships, effectively preclude the possibility of an accidental nuclear detonation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) On 8 July 1996 the International Court of Justice handed down an advisory opinion as to whether the threat or use of nuclear weapons is, in any circumstances, permitted under international law. The Court reached the conclusion that the use of nuclear weapons, in all but the most extreme circumstances, would be illegal. The Court was, however, unable to find any evidence suggesting that the possession of nuclear weapons is illegal under international law. The Court was not called upon to consider the legality of nuclear powered ships. Exercise Tandem Thrust does not include scenarios anticipating the use of nuclear weapons. The Australian Government does not consider that the presence of nuclear powered warships in Exercise Tandem Thrust is in breach of international law.</PARA>

Mr Smith wrote in the November edition of National Healthcare that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The entry contribution to be paid is subject to the resident being left with 2.5 times the annual pension ($22,000) in assets after having paid the entry contribution.

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Neal&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the concerns expressed by the Acting Privacy Commissioner that private health funds are obtaining access to patients' health records in order to verify claims without their permission? Is the Minister aware that Medibank Private enjoys this contractual right to access medical records and that it does not require the patient's consent? Shouldn't privately insured patients enjoy the same privacy protection as those in the public sector&mdash;that is that the personal consent of the patient or a court order is required prior to access to medical records being provided?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Acting Privacy Commissioner has recently raised concerns over the issue of informed consent by fund members prior to a health fund accessing clinical medical records in the course of audits or contractual disputes with hospitals and health care professionals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this context, the legislation governing the relationship between hospitals and health funds which enter into contracts provides some guidance to the current legal position. The National Health Act 1953 was amended in 1995 to allow health funds to enter into hospital purchaser-provider agreements. Section 73BD of the Act sets out the provisions which must be included in any such agreement. Paragraph 73BD(2)(c) requires hospitals which enter into such agreements to provide to health funds the information specified in the Hospital Casemix Protocol, as prescribed by regulation. This includes information on the patient's condition and treatment, length of stay in hospital and other factors which determine the cost to the fund. Accordingly, the Labor Party's 1995 legislation allows that such information be provided 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to funds so that they can assess whether the account rendered by the hospital is accurate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would be concerned if this provision was being interpreted as allowing open-ended access, by Medibank Private or any other health fund, to complete medical records without the knowledge or authority of patients. The Government will be reviewing the need for legislative amendment to address this issue. In the meantime, the Department of Health and Family Services is discussing the issue with the Acting Privacy Commissioner with a view to ensuring that access to medical records for benefit purposes is exercise sensitively and appropriately.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole question of the Prime Minister's credibility was raised because articles appearing in his name are no longer election promises. This is not a core promise, this is not a non-core promise; this is a view put by the apparatchiks at Robert Menzies House in his name that he will no longer stand by. The doubt it raises in our mind is how many other promises were made in the election campaign which he will not stand by and for which he will shift the blame up the road to Robert Menzies House.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All those statements before the election campaign simply said it wasn't our policy at the time of the election campaign.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of promises, let me remind the Senate of what the Prime Minister said on the Ray Martin program. He is not going too well on that program. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think credibility is very important and I want to make it very clear, Ray, that I'm not going to promise anything in the lead-up to the next election campaign that I know in my heart I can't deliver. I would rather promise half of what the people want me to promise and deliver a lot when I am Prime Minister than promise everything they ask for and find I've got to take half of it back after I get there.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We know he has taken it back. There is a whole string of broken election promises. One thing you should never renege on is the `I shan't'. Saying `I will' at least gives you a chance over time to get the timing right. Because you can say, `We have promised to do that, but we cannot because of budgetary and other reasons.' When you give a categorical `we shall not', you should not break it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was said time and time again by the employment minister that they would not bring in a particular program. It was said time and time again by him that they did not favour that scheme. In nine or 10 months they get into political trouble and one of their parliamentary secretaries implodes. So what is the distracter? Ring up the Laurie Oakes program and say, `I will let you cross&hyphen;examine me on that but I've got a big story for you.' There has been no consultation in the Public Service about this.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The important thing that seems to be missed time and again here is that the Australian public elected us to do a job. What they expected was that we would make some hard decisions. Those who voted for you last time around&mdash;albeit record lows&mdash;also expected you to address your mind to the issues. If you have an argument, they expect you to debate it. They do not expect you to snipe on the sidelines about who signed a document or whether someone said `will' instead of `will not'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They want to know where you stand on proposals like work for the dole and, if you are opposed to them, why you are opposed to them. Why do you not like the idea of people being expected to do something in return for taxpayers' funds being  made available to them, within the safety net arrangements, on the basis that it can provide them with on&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training? We do not hear a word about any of that. All we get is carping minutiae, which it seems is a favourite term of Senator Schacht.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the public is very disappointed to find that a Labor opposition, after almost 12 months, has not got around to thinking about the important policy issues. Times do change. Things move on. There are new issues that arise every day. If you are simply going to lock yourself into the past and pore over documents to find commas out of place, you will find that you will simply get another resounding thrashing at the next election. What you ought to do is take the issue seriously and decide whether or not you are prepared to show leadership. That is why Mr Howard has been performing so well in the minds of the Australian electorate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister is on the right track because he can read the mood of the people and he understands that they want decisions made and these issues addressed. That is what you ought to face up to&mdash;not simply trying to find procedural deficiencies in documents, but giving us the merits of the argument, an action which would be totally foreign to Senator Schacht. I have offered him help on these things, but you can only go so far. If he wants more information or material, I am happy to provide it. But let us have a sensible policy discussion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know you enjoy politics. You can do that all around the traps. But you should not do it to the exclusion of policy formulation. You have to come up with a document in due course. The sooner you start, the better. I can tell you that it is a lot easier if you get the mind working, test a few propositions, go out around the traps and ask them what they think. They will be quite impressed. You might be off to a slow start, but they will say, `Well, at least the bloke's trying. We know that he has a long way to go, but at least he's prepared to explore.' But if they just see this bloke getting to his feet every second day in parliament, giving people another serve and not addressing the issues, they will say, `Why should we ever give them another chance?'</PARA>

Twice today Senator Alston&mdash;who in his remarks abuses us for lack of policy content&mdash;refused to rule out the imposition of a 50c directory assistance fee. He obfuscated, he made all sorts of excuses, but he would not rule it out. At the same time this is being said by him in this chamber, in the other chamber, without equivocation, Mr Howard is saying, `I rule that out; there will be no directory assistance charge. This was our promise to the people at the last election; we will not introduce it'&mdash;bang, crash, wallop.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. 4. It is not three strikes and you are out; it is now four strikes and you are dead&mdash;you are dead meat chucked overboard. There have been few other occasions in politics where we have seen a Prime Minister dump more dead weight overboard than the Prime Minster has dumped today. He has dumped Senator Herron overboard. He has dumped the Minister for Communications and the Arts overboard. I find it extraordinary that the Prime Minister never chose during this morning's preparation for question time to tell Alston, the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, the senior minister who ranks No. 4 in the Liberal Party hierarchy, `This is what I am going to say in the House of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="575"> Representatives today, if I am asked.' Instead, he let Senator Alston come in here and humiliate himself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Towards the end of question time Senator Alston, after having refused to rule out a directory assistance charge, abused Senator Ellison and me for our temerity at even raising the issue. We then saw him receive the phone call. The white phone came up to the ear and then he was given the message, `The Prime Minister has just dumped you overboard.' Next we saw the minister's cheeky face dissolve to a whiter shade of pale. You should have seen the look on his face. He suddenly realised that this Prime Minister had done him over. As I say, this is the fourth time he has become the doormat of the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder what power of policy this minister has? He has none, yet he gets up there and abuses us for having a lack of policy content. On every major issue in the last 11 months since Senator Alston became a minister, the Prime Minister has dumped on him. I find it again extraordinary that today, for four hours before question time, nobody had the wit in the office of the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, to ring the Prime Minister and check, `What is your view, Prime Minister?' It is even more extraordinary for the Prime Minister not to have asked his staff to go and tell Senator Alston's staff, `If I'm asked, I'm ruling out a directory assistance fee, which is absolutely in line with our policy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extraordinary bumbling of this government, the lack of communication between a Prime Minister and the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, the No. 4 minister in his own cabinet, is just extraordinary. It really shows why this government administratively keeps going from one disaster to the next. And we had other examples of this being exposed during question time today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Alston ought to be demanding of the Prime Minister, `What is going on?' Clearly, he should say to the Prime Minister, `Prime Minister, don't you have any confidence in my ability? Why do you keep dumping on me? Why do you keep pulling 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the rug out from under me and contradicting the answer I was giving in the Senate today?' It is an extraordinary thing. It would have taken one phone call to get the one answer from both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard was quite happy&mdash;in the terms of Richard Nixon&mdash;to let this minister `hang and twist in the wind'. This minister is dead meat.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="576"> Finance, your now leader, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), promised the Australian people that the budget was in surplus. We now know that that was untruthful to the tune of $10 billion. Senator Cook, Senator Collins, Senator Schacht&mdash;all those who have contributed to this debate&mdash;and even Senator Robert Ray, sat round the cabinet table. One has to ask the question: did they accept the Treasury briefings? Did they know what was happening in the country that they were required to govern? Did you know what the Treasury advice was when you went around this country day after day, hour after hour saying that the new government, no matter which it was, would be given a budget surplus? That was wrong to the tune of $10 billion, and you have the audacity to come in here and try to snap at our heels about the work for the dole scheme. I ask you!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the important issue that this country is facing? Is it really the work for the dole scheme or is it the $10 billion legacy that you left us? The Australian people know. I cannot understand how you can have remained so detached from your fellow Australians for such a long time. I would have thought that 2 March 1996 would have taught you a salutary lesson about being detached from the Australian people, but you are persisting with your detachment. Quite frankly, we on this side are delighted, because the longer you remain detached, the longer you will leave us in government unopposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia are giving the work for the dole system overwhelming support. I am sure if senators opposite were to be honest they would acknowledge the overwhelming number of phone calls coming into their electorate offices&mdash;as they are coming into mine&mdash;supporting this proposal. The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) indicated the overwhelming result in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald Sun</EMPHASIS>&mdash;95 per cent support. You can snap at our heels and say, `Look, the wording wasn't quite correct,' or say that something was not quite correct.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to see that Senator Abetz is now beating a retreat from this chamber. He tried to trawl over everything except the issue under discussion and why the opposition rose to protest the answer by the Minister for the Environment and Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill was answering on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). He was not in here as just any passing backbench senator; he is the Leader of the Government in the Senate and represents the Prime Minister. Speaking on behalf of the Howard coalition government and the Prime Minister, he put forward a very feeble&mdash;in fact, ineffectual&mdash;defence for what is causing a great amount of anguish and pain for the Labor opposition. The point that we want to raise is that Mr Howard is not holding to his promise to raise the standard and maintain integrity, honesty and honour in government. He has broken his word at every opportunity. Mr Howard said he would lift the bar and raise the standard of integrity in parliament.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="577">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You only have to go through the litany to see what Mr Howard has done since he became Prime Minister and why we are prepared to take note of his answer today. It is just another example of Mr Howard ducking and twisting away from the label `Honest John'. Mr Howard is no longer worthy of that title. He has lowered the standards of integrity in this place. He has done so in particular by saying that the government would have a work for the dole program in the face of categorically denying that he would do that in the lead&hyphen;up to the election. The question is: why did Mr Howard say, `We will not do that,' in the lead&hyphen;up to the election? He is prepared to do it now because he thinks it is popular, but he thought it might have been a bit unpopular in the lead&hyphen;up to the election. He has changed his face and his mind about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that Senator Abetz argues that, because a large number of people rang or wrote to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald Sun </EMPHASIS>or rang a television station, it constitutes the mind of the people, the majority, and that is all. But, even if it were a majority, Mr Howard is not prepared to support the majority will of the people on the question of euthanasia, for example. The majority of people in this country say that they are perfectly happy to allow euthanasia under certain circumstances, and yet a majority in the House of Representatives, on conscience, have voted against that. Let us not use that feeble argument, Senator Abetz. It is pathetic, and you know it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are complaining about is the shifting ground of policy of this government. That is why it is entirely appropriate for Senator Schacht to raise the other shift that we saw right before our eyes during Senate question time. Senator Alston was saying one thing about policy and his leader in the other place was pulling the rug from under his feet and changing that policy on the run, to the acute embarrassment of his minister in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course we all raise those points because they all go to the integrity of the Prime Minister&mdash;a Prime Minister who can so conveniently forget a briefing from his Attorney-General about the Australian Federal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Police investigating a senator, a Prime Minister who can so conveniently forget what policies he put his name to in the last election and a Prime Minister who can suddenly change the rules of the game when it comes to his ministers owning shares and being in a state of conflict of interest. He just changes the rules on the run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the point at issue for this opposition&mdash;the integrity of the Prime Minister. It is an integrity that is crumbling in front of the eyes of the  Australian people. What sense do you make of a Prime Minister who says on Ray Martin's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair </EMPHASIS>in 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think credibility is very important and I want to make it very clear, Ray, that I'm not going to promise anything in the lead-up to the next election campaign that I know in my heart I can't deliver, and I would rather promise half of what people want me to promise and deliver the lot when I'm Prime Minister than promise everything they ask for, and find I've got to take half of it back after I get there.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what he said in 1995 and that is exactly contrary to what he has been doing since he became Prime Minister. That is the point at issue for this opposition. It is not any particular example, although each one of them would do. This Prime Minister's integrity is in tatters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what this opposition is for. We are asking for integrity in parliament. We are asking for Prime Minister Howard to stand up and actually do what he said he would do. We are pointing out at every opportunity that he is not. He is forgetting meetings, his memory is very questionable and his integrity and his requirement for ministers changes from minute to minute depending on what those ministers are up to. Policy that does affect every person in this country is changed just like that when it suits the Prime Minister and he forgets what his ministers say.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="578"> incentive for people to find employment and assist young people to find jobs. The work for the dole scheme does just that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my state the response has been overwhelmingly in favour of this proposal. The Prime Minister is doing what the people want him to do. The Prime Minister is governing the country as he was elected to do. He is doing no more and no less. What more could you ask of a Prime Minister than that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today the opposition was like a ship at sea with its questions. In fact, I would not be surprised to see in the employment column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times </EMPHASIS>tomorrow the advertisement, `Wanted: new questions committee. Apply to the Senate ALP opposition.' None was more desperate than the question to Senator Herron. What an absolutely bobby&hyphen;dazzler that was! The question to Senator Herron was about inducing someone to stand down from a board. The allegation was that there was some inducement, some interference, with a Commonwealth officer in the performance of her duty. That was just outrageous. Senator Herron had approached Gabi Hollows because of her experience with Aboriginal people, particularly in the health sphere, to look at making a contribution to his portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This opposition talks about policy but it does not talk about its policy because it does not have one. Senator Herron was demonstrating that this government wants to increase female representation on Commonwealth boards and bodies, and is doing so. In fact, it has increased under this government. What they will not talk about is how we have increased female representation on our side of politics and they have not. We did not need a quota to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Herron was doing the unforgivable in trying to put more women on to bodies or bringing them in to assist in his portfolios and employing someone who had experience in the sphere of Aboriginal affairs, particularly in relation to Aboriginal health. That is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> precisely what the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) said in the other place. He said that in the course of his discussions with Gabi Hollows it became apparent that she did not have any aviation expertise but she did have a distinct interest and expertise in the area of Aboriginal health. He contacted the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and told him that he had someone who could help in his portfolio. What is wrong with that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the people listening to this broadcast that it would be negligent of a government minister, if they came across someone who was not suited to the portfolio they were in, not to say, `Look, this person can help in another portfolio' and that would be in Aboriginal health, where Gabi Hollows had such expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition used the word `inducement'. They said, `Did you induce?' That always has nefarious connotations. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Macquarie Dictionary</EMPHASIS> says that `induce' means `to lead or move by persuasion or influence, as to some action, state of mind, etc'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Herron did was make an offer. He was doing something which was entirely appropriate. He was making an offer to someone with expertise who would help in his portfolio. There was no inducement. There was no motive to interfere with the exercise of an officer in the employ of the Commonwealth. There was nothing of the sort. Yet that was the implication that the opposition would like to bring. When you look at that, I can quite understand how you could well be advertising for a new questions committee tomorrow.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance before the Senate this afternoon is the midyear economic and fiscal outlook of 1996-97 released just over two weeks ago by the very arrogant Treasurer, Mr Costello. I intend to highlight a number of major contradictions in the position of Mr Costello and the Liberal government that are illustrated by his release of this document and some comments he made in reference to it as well as some content in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first comment I want to make is in respect of the nature of this document. Mr Costello was not quite in the swaggering form that he normally is, but I will get to the reason why a little later. He released this document to the public boasting that it was some 100 pages long and that this, by the very length of the document, represented in part at least some massive new contribution to economic and fiscal debate in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But of course what we should remember is that the document, in terms of the content relating to the economic and fiscal statistics that are laid out, is approximately 36 pages long. The majority of the document in fact is an outline of some government promises that have been implemented. If the length of the document is to carry any weight at all, then I think we should remember that particular point. Labor introduced midyear economic statements and if we were to have hyped up the media and the public by highlighting the length of the document then we could have added 100 or 200 pages highlighting various election promises&mdash;or the breaking of election promises, in this government's case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did refer to the arrogant Treasurer's swagger. It was slightly less than normal because if we look at page 1 of the document 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="580"> we see that he had to confess to a deterioration of some $2.9 billion on budget estimates&mdash;a deterioration of almost $3 billion in six months. We certainly hope that this level of deterioration does not continue over this government's term in office, otherwise $3 billion every six months is going to make our alleged black hole look like a small ditch in comparison.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FERGUSON" NAMEID="EP5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EP5">Senator Ferguson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You've admitted it.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No; I said, `alleged black hole.' What is important in highlighting the deterioration in terms of this $3 billion is the great difficulty that you have in accurately making forecasts and estimates. It is important to highlight to the Senate that in fact the majority of the alleged back hole that was left by the Labor government in fact was due to a change in economic outcomes and forecasts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer is always arrogantly asserting that we left a $9 billion or $10 billion black hole and he refuses to concede that, in significant part at least, that alleged black hole was due to a deterioration in our forward budget estimates. And he is confronted by the same problem&mdash;$3 billion&mdash;primarily because of a shortfall in company tax receipts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was no fabrication; but what is Treasurer Costello's response to this $3 billion deterioration in company tax collections? His response is, `You blame everyone, but don't blame me.' That is the standard approach of this government and the standard approach of this Treasurer. He blamed Treasury; he blamed Finance; he blames the Senate; he blames the previous government&mdash;`Blame anyone but the Treasurer: me, the arrogant Mr Costello.' This has become the typical approach of this government. When there is any good economic news, the Treasurer says, `Ah ha! I take the credit. The Liberal government takes the credit.' When there is any bad economic news, he blames anyone else&mdash;usually the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Inflation and interest rates also highlight this. The Treasurer continues to highlight the very low inflation rate we currently enjoy. No economic spokesman in this country whom I have heard comment about the low inflation rate we now enjoy has not acknowledged the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fact that inflation was crushed under a Labor government, but we never hear anything of this from Treasurer Costello or indeed from Senator Kemp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Returning to company tax collections: this midyear economic review, as I said earlier, highlights the difficulty of relying on future estimates and projections. But the other aspect of this midyear economic and fiscal outlook is that it does highlight the failure of the general economic approach of the government. Their general approach, slash and burn, has slowly strangled the economy. We heard Senator Kemp boast today about low interest rates. It is good that interest rates are coming down as a result of low inflation, as a result of the contribution the Labor government made to strangling inflation in this economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kemp, who must have been so ambitious in his climb to becoming Assistant Treasurer, cannot be listening to small business. Certainly small business in my state and around Australia are complaining about the lack of demand in the economy, the lack of confidence in the economy, which is having a very serious effect on consumption, on consumer expenditure. Again, we have seen recent figures on that.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="COOK" NAMEID="RF4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Retail figures were down.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We only have to look at the retail figures, as Senator Cook mentions. Retail actually fell in the three months up to Christmas. I certainly cannot remember a year when retail figures fell in the three months before Christmas. I think it is probably 13 or 14 years since that has happened. It is certainly the biggest three&hyphen;monthly fall in the last 13 years. We could quite easily see nil economic growth&mdash;my colleague Senator Cook will spend more time on this matter than I will&mdash;in the next quarter because the government has slowed the economy quite deliberately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect of this slash and burn approach of the government and the problem they now have involving the additional $3 billion&mdash;the Costello chasm, as it is being dubbed by the media&mdash;is that the government will have to be even tougher in a range of expenditure areas in the lead-up to the next budget. Apparently the Prime Minister (Mr 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="581"> Howard) has ruled out cutting the diesel fuel rebate. He and the Treasurer have ruled out cuts to education and health, despite their continuing assertions that they will not engage in pre-budget speculation. At least the National Party managed to get a commitment from them with respect to the diesel fuel rebate. It is about the only thing the National Party can win these days, I might add.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will be the government's approach in the lead-up to the next budget? It looks as though the states are in for a hammering yet again. We can all recall the last meeting with the states at the Premiers Conference. For over a week the arrogant Treasurer, Mr Costello, got lambasted by his own political colleagues for the very extensive cutbacks to the states. Cutbacks usually mean two things: cuts in services and increases in taxes. This government promised not to introduce new taxes or increase existing taxes but it cut revenue to the states and forced them to put up taxes, which is exactly what has happened in almost every state in Australia, or it redefined what a tax is and called it a surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have the infamous superannuation surcharge, as the government continues to insist it be called. No&hyphen;one else in this country&mdash;no economist, no superannuation writer&mdash;refers to it as a surcharge. They refer to it as a tax. In fact, it is the largest revenue raiser in this budget&mdash;a half a billion dollars.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not have much competition, Senator Campbell, but it is still a breach of your election commitment not to introduce new taxes and not to increase existing taxes. I want to briefly draw to the Senate's attention a problem with the revenue estimate for this superannuation so&hyphen;called surcharge&mdash;half a billion dollars over the next three years. One of the issues was highlighted today in question time by my colleague Senator Conroy: the government is expecting to collect this money from state superannuation funds, yet last week the Treasurer&mdash;his press release was the subject of heated debate in the government caucus room yesterday&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You do not have a caucus, but you certainly had a heated debate about this new 15 per cent tax on superannuation. But the problem the government faces is that, constitutionally, it cannot collect the money from state superannuation funds. Why is the government, six months after it has announced this new tax, finally turning its attention to this problem? Why has the government taken six months to discover that, constitutionally, the states can quite readily refuse to pay the tax? That will lead to a problem in the estimated revenue of half a billion dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another problem with this new tax is that 40 per cent of the people who will supposedly pay the tax can elect to contribute money to superannuation. It is not compulsory. I know from the extensive industry contacts that I have&mdash;not one of these industry contacts, by the way, supports the collection mechanism of this surcharge&mdash;that extensive switching is already taking place.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You would know this, Senator, because you were one of the ones raising a fracas about this issue in the Liberal Party meeting yesterday. Significant switching is taking effect. I say now to the Senate: you will not collect your half a billion dollars in the superannuation tax each year over the next three years because of the switching and the other sorts of problems that have arisen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have one final point. Table 18 shows the hypocrisy of the arrogant Treasurer, Mr Costello, to blame the Senate. Table 19 outlines the impact on revenue&mdash;$376 million&mdash;which he says the Senate causes. But, right beside it on table 18, there is $358 million in new expenditure&mdash;new announcements&mdash;by this government since the budget. The Treasurer has the hypocrisy to abuse the Senate and accuse us of obstructionism and fiddling with budget outcomes when, on the very next page&mdash;page 30&mdash;he admits that, since the budget, they have engaged in $358 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="582"> million over four years of additional expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This further highlights the hypocrisy and the excuse making of this government and this Treasurer. This is a Treasurer who takes the attitude, `Blame anyone but me. I'll take the credit, but blame the states, blame the Labor Party, blame the Senate. I will take the credit all the time.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Sherry) because today he has put his name and his moniker on an important document in Australian political history. Indeed in the political debates of 1996 much time was spent on discussing the Beazley black hole or the Beazley bankcard and the Labor legacy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course Labor always denied that there was this legacy, that there was this black hole or that there was the Beazley bankcard that had been burnt out. That applied to some of the Australian Democrats too. For example, Senator Murray, although he will admit that there is a black hole and that we do have a deficit problem, disputes the size of that black hole. He prefers to think that it was only $6 billion. We claim that it was more like $11 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Sherry has done here today has been to sign on&mdash;to create documentary proof over his signature&mdash;that indeed there is a multibillion dollar black hole. But what he has neatly done&mdash;and I think he has made a fool of himself in so doing&mdash;has been to say, `Okay, there really is a black hole. But what we'll do is slice off just under a third of it and we'll call it the Costello portion of the black hole.' No-one who follows anything to do with economics in Australia and who has read the midyear economic review would doubt that the cause of the shortfall is indeed failed Labor policy. Senator Sherry has really said, `We admit there's a $3 billion black hole. We won't talk about the other $9 billion. We won't talk about the fiscal task&mdash;the Labor legacy&mdash;that was left for this government to sort out, but we'll say that you've had the honesty to produce this midyear economic review.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the first time in Australian history that a government has actually produced a substantial document which goes into some significant detail about the state of the economy and the state of the nation's finances and makes predictions for many years hence. Not only do those opposite criticise us for being honest. Senator Sherry was prepared to talk about hypocrisy. I congratulate Senator Sherry for being able to&mdash;it will be interesting to see if Senator Cook can pull off the same achievement&mdash;actually stand up here and talk for just over 10 minutes about hypocrisy! They come into this place and criticise this government for introducing a charter of budget honesty&mdash;we look forward to seeing how Senator Cook and Senator Sherry vote on that bill&mdash;and for coming clean in relation to the nation's finances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We produced a 98&hyphen;page document&mdash;if you want to do a comparison of how many pages that document is&mdash;released only very recently by the Treasurer. It gave updated forward estimates for both the budget and general government sectors. It updated the economic forecasts for 1996&hyphen;97, major economic parameters for the three years beyond the budget year in terms of growth of gross domestic product, employment growth, wages and prices, the projections of aggregate tax expenditures for the three years beyond the budget year and a detailed statement of risks which may affect any aspect of those fiscal outlooks. So it is a significant forecast document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask all senators&mdash;indeed any person who cares to take an interest in the economy of Australia&mdash;to compare that with Labor's record when it came to telling the Australian people what was happening to their government and to taxpayers' money when the Labor Party last had the opportunity to do so. The last midyear economic review that was issued by an Australian government was an 11&hyphen;sentence report contained within a press release of no more than three pages. It is interesting to know what it did not contain. It did not contain any economic or fiscal projections. It did not report on the underlying deficit. It did not include loan repayments. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="583"> Indeed, the document claimed that the budget was still in surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course we found out four months later that the budget was not in surplus. The three&hyphen;page press release issued by the previous Australian Labor Party government covered up the fact that there was a deficit in excess of $10 billion in that fiscal year. It did not contain any information on tax expenditures and not a skerrick of information about any potential risks to the fiscal outlook.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think anyone who is listening to this debate, Labor Party senators opposite and anyone concerned with honesty, integrity and reporting fairly to the Australian people&mdash;and indeed to the parliament&mdash;about the nation's finances, would be fascinated to know on what day that document was released. It was released on 21 December, which was the Thursday before a Monday Christmas Day. The Labor Party was so concerned to ensure that this document&mdash;if you could call a three&hyphen;page press release with exactly 11 sentences devoted to fiscal outlook a document&mdash;was released that they released it on the Thursday night, which was virtually Christmas Eve. Tremendous!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This document did cover up the fact that there was a $10 billion deficit. Mr Beazley, the now Leader of the Opposition, whose name will be attached to the $10 billion black hole or the $10 billion burnt out bankcard, was indeed the chief person in the lead&hyphen;up to the last election who was given the job of going onto the radio waves and onto the television sets of Australia to inform people that the budget was balanced, that there were no problems and that everything was going along swimmingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, he could almost have stolen Senator Cook's words in the Senate on 16 March, when he was talking about one of the fiscal parameters, the current account figures that had been released on that day, and, I think it would be fair to say, referring generally to the economy:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I would do so by saying that the wind is in our sails, we are on a calm sea, we are on a broad reach, we are reaching well and we are on course.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Cook was reassuring the Australian people what a rosy situation, what a rosy 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> scenario, the then government had created for the economy. He made me feel a bit sad that I was sitting in the Senate that day and not actually out there on a boat sailing on a broad reach. He was very poetic but he was inaccurate&mdash;just as inaccurate as Mr Beazley was in the lead up to the election about the state of Australia's economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has this government done in relation to the economy in the relatively short time we have been in power, not yet one year? We have attacked the underlying deficit problem. We have achieved something like $7.2 billion off the 1997&hyphen;98 deficit projections. We have a lot further to go but the problem of deficit reduction has well and truly been broken and that is not an easy problem to have to battle. Trying to reduce that sort of deficit, that sort of black hole, is hard work and it means sacrifices in many parts of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said that we have got further achievements to make. We do still remain committed to our policy objective of balancing the budget over this term of the parliament but we want to do more. We want to ensure that people get the benefits of that fiscal restraint. We want to ensure interest rate reductions because the reductions in the deficit of the government do lower interest rate pressures. We have seen significant reductions in interest rates. Mortgage rates have fallen something like 2&frac14; per cent in the term of this government&mdash;a significant advantage for Australian families&mdash;and, of course, business rates are also beginning to fall. The government has made it quite clear that we would like to see those rates fall faster so small businesses can expand and offer more opportunities for young Australians to get jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have done all this with a low inflation economy. Senator Sherry quite misleadingly said that if you slash and burn the economy what do you expect? You expect low inflation. But the difference between this government and the previous government is that they were able to achieve the miracle of having high inflation and low growth and basically not achieve any employment gains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have been able to achieve in a short time is a very significant and steady 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="584"> growth of 3.5 per cent&mdash;and that is the prediction for the next couple of fiscal years. Sure, retail spending is down. We are not pleased with those results. But on the other side of the coin, investment spending and predictions for investment spending are bubbling along at 17 per cent. I am sure Senator Cook would welcome that side of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that under Labor, particularly in that last year or so&mdash;Senator Cook, we have had arguments about this before; you used to proclaim from the rafters that Australia had a low inflation economy&mdash;even if you look back to, say, June 1995 in the last year of their term, Australia was still going along with inflation rates of four&hyphen;ish per cent. That was much higher than our OECD partners that were averaging between 1.9 and 2.1 per cent&mdash;and I refer to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> of 24 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were beaten in the inflation stakes only by Italy and Spain. All the other OECD nations had lower inflation rates than Australia did. It was possible for a government that wanted to deceive people to say that we were a low inflation economy because under Labor you had been used to inflation rates of up to 10 per cent or more. So four per cent seems small but the reality is that we were comparatively still a high inflation economy under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other deception was that as interest rates came down  or at least nominal interest rates came down you were able to say, `We have interest rates down.' But the fact was that real interest rates in Australia were still amongst the highest in the world. In fact, I think only Italy beat us month in and month out for real interest rate figures. During the term of the Keating government, Australia topped the table for real interest rates in virtually every year. Under the previous Liberal administrations, in terms of real interest rates we were ranked in the middle of the OECD. You guys had the incredible achievement of having some of the highest real interest rates in the world for all of that term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, and in conclusion to allow time for other senators to make contributions, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this government has been committed to delivering reforms to make the labour market more efficient. The workplace relations act is in place. It is already making achievements and will assist small business, particularly in relation to the unfair dismissals changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have had three interest rate cuts under this government. You have had reductions in capital gains tax, roll&hyphen;over provisions for small businesses, significant reductions&mdash;a commitment from Mr Moore&mdash;in the paper burden on small businesses, and a whole range of measures which will assist small businesses to get back on their feet and, of course, to encourage more people into small business. I repeat: it is the height of hypocrisy for a Labor Party to come in here and move this sort of motion, complaining about the mid&hyphen;year review, when they had none and their record as economic managers was abysmal.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I rise to speak to this matter of public importance, it seems as though the Australian Democrats are not going to take part in this debate. I can only wonder why. It would appear as though perhaps the words that have been used by Senator Sherry in bringing forward this matter of public importance certainly are not agreed to by the Democrats and, as a result of that, they do not wish to take part in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that does not diminish my willingness to take part in this debate because I could not help but notice when Senator Sherry was speaking earlier that he very often used the words our `arrogant Treasurer'. I think Senator Sherry has a nerve to start talking about an arrogant Treasurer when not so very long ago we had a Labor government Treasurer who stated publicly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have Treasury in my pocket, the Reserve Bank in my pocket, wages policy in my pocket, the financial community both here and overseas in my pocket.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So if you want to talk about arrogance you only have to look at the performance of the Labor government and the speech that was made by the former Prime Minister and former Treasurer, Paul Keating, in an address to the Canberra press gallery.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="585">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In saying that, the Labor Party of today, the opposition of today, is trying desperately to shake off that sort of arrogance and approach to fiscal matters that was taken by the former Prime Minister, a former Treasurer. They are continually trying desperately to escape from their record of those years, which is well known to all of us and all of the Australian voting public who so comprehensively rejected them at the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should also remember that the former Prime Minister in one of his more candid moments said, `Labor is the architect of where Australia is today.' I could not agree with him more. Labor is the architect of where Australia is today. If you ask the people of Australia what they remember most, they remember the difficulties that the previous Labor government has left them with. The government is desperately trying to find solutions for them in order to make their lives better and make the conditions in which they have to run their businesses far better than they have been for the past 13 years, because Australia today is not where it ought to be. If it had not been for the legacy that was left after those previous 13 years, I can tell you that the Australian business community, particularly the Australian small business community, would not be in the situation that they are in today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As if you need reminding, let me tell you that at the conclusion of 13 years of Labor government, in 1994-95&mdash;which was the last full year of the Labor government&mdash;they had a deficit equal to six per cent of the GDP, which was the worst in the OECD. They had record deficits in that last year of government. They had high interest rates. At that stage, they had the second highest bank prime rate amongst developed nations. Unemployment stood at over 730,000 Australians, with a very high youth unemployment component. At that stage we had a $181 billion foreign debt&mdash;an 800 per cent increase during the term of their 13 years of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry has a hide to come in here and talk about what this government has done in producing a mid-year review. It is a comprehensive mid-year review of some 100 pages which, as my colleague Senator Camp 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bell said, compares most favourably with the last Labor mid-year review, which contained three pages, a couple of tables and just 11 sentences dedicated to the fiscal outlook.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had all this at a time prior to an impending election where the Labor Party continued to tell us that the budget was in surplus. That was their mid-year outlook. We have presented this mid-year review telling the Australian population the truth about exactly what is happening. It is a situation that was forecast by Treasury which has proven to be wrong, and it has left us with a deficit that is much larger than was anticipated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the 13 years of Labor government&mdash;which most people do not need reminding finished only some 10 months ago&mdash;the world per capita income ranking had fallen from 10th to 22nd in the 10 years to 1993, with poverty and income inequality worsening. Throughout all of that time&mdash;when they were supposedly looking after those people whom they say they represented&mdash;the inequality was worsening. National savings were lower than they were at the depths of the 1982-83 recession and, at the time they lost government, household savings were at historical low levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were at the situation where there had been six consecutive underlying budget deficits, and there had been massive asset sales to fund current expenditure. So there were underlying budget deficits, yet there were still massive asset sales to try to fund the current expenditure. The Commonwealth debt itself was up some 300 per cent in the four years to reach nearly $100 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Added to that, we had an increasingly complex tax system, which was adding a burden to Australian taxpayers and, even more importantly, was adding a burden to Australian small businesses. They were finding it complicated to find the time necessary to complete the paperwork, particularly in very small businesses. It was most onerous and made life much more difficult than it needed to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have the situation where we have a criticism from this government about the publication of a Liberal government mid-year 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="586"> economic review and the revelations of that review when, in fact, for the first time this government has been prepared to tell the Australian voters exactly as it is. They have not been afraid to tell the Australian voters exactly what the economic situation is and what the future holds. Compare that with the last review, which did not contain any economic or fiscal projections and which insisted that the budget was in surplus when, in fact, all the time they knew that it was in deficit. They did not report the underlying deficit and included loan repayments as outlays offsets to claim that the budget was still in surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that there is no deceit in this mid-year review. It is telling everybody exactly as it stands, which is something that the Labor Party never managed to do in their 13 years in government. So Senator Sherry should not try to tell us on some moral high ground that what we are doing is not quite right and that we should not be saying the sorts of things or printing the sorts of things that are in this review, because it is something that you never did. Our Treasurer (Mr Costello) has gone out of his way to make sure that the Australian people know exactly what the situation is.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in this debate and support the remarks of my colleague Senator Sherry. I do so by opening and making an observation directly about the Australian economy and the state it is in now. The economy is very flat. The growth levels of the economy are very low. What we are looking at is a loss of consumer confidence, because the retail trading figures for the year are at a record low. What we are looking at as well is a high level of bankruptcies. The bankruptcies for the last quarter to the end of December were at a record high. What we are looking at as well is a revision downwards by all the forecasters on what the profit level for private corporations in this country will be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not an edifying scene. This government was elected on the basis of pushing the interests of small business. The best small business policy is a growth economy. Last year this government chose to bring in a contractionary budget for the domestic Aus 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tralian economy and to pin their hopes on growth for the Australian economy on international growth; that is, economies outside of Australia are growing faster and pulling us up because we are a trading nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a budget that had no expansion for the domestic economy at all. It contracted the domestic economy, and it did so by slashing and burning a lot of government outlays. The effect of that is now being felt. The economy is flat, employment prospects are worse than they were before, when the budget was brought down, and many private sector economists believe that the figures published in the mid&hyphen;term review by the government overstate the case, are rubbery and are not reliable. In fact, the consensus of private sector economists is that the government figures are too high, that growth will be down but unemployment will be up, and that private consumption will be down, meaning that at the end of the day, when this budget finally tallies its figures and is reported to the parliament, there will be a bigger hole in it than there is currently forecast. It is a deliberate policy of the government, it should be remembered, to do those things, because they chose the settings that have now brought about that outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are essentially four points that I would like to make in this debate when talking about this mid&hyphen;term review. The first point is that the mid&hyphen;term review, which is being bruited by the government as being some spectacular example of their being open with the community, is not new. It happens every year. It happened every year we were in government, and every year we were in government we reported on the state of the economy and the state of the budget at the mid&hyphen;term. So nothing new is happening here.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly the government brought out a thicker book than we did, and it did so because it had a huge set of appendices and tables attached to it. Well, bully for you. But let there not be any pretension here that what is being done is some startlingly new policy in open government. The mid&hyphen;term review is a standard mechanism for economic reporting in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="587">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that what the review did show is that the government has blown a $3 billion black hole, or a Costello chasm, in its own forward estimates. It did so by underestimating the amount of taxation it would recover from the business sector, and it got its figures wrong. It is now collecting some $3 billion less than it anticipated and the budget deficit is therefore much greater. The problem that all the slashing and burning was supposed to have resolved last year is intractable and unresolved by this. The government is therefore looking at a budget for the 1997&hyphen;98 year, to be brought down on 13 May, that will have to go into further cuts, and further cuts obviously will take in health, welfare, education, defence and all the services that are the big spending departments of this government and areas that people in Australia rely on for some assistance and support. Those areas are all, of course, under the knife. My colleague Senator Sherry spoke in some detail on the new $3 billion hole and I will leave it there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point I would make about what the mid&hyphen;term review reveals is that it reveals a callous government, because this government has no strategic economic policy to deal with the most intractable economic issue in Australia today, and that is the problem of unemployment. Unemployment is the No. 1 economic issue for this nation. This review of the budget's performance reveals that the government has no policy to deal with it, because what this review shows is that unemployment will rise in the budgetary period and growth will rise, in the government's own estimates, from 3.25 per cent&mdash;from 3.5 per cent to 3.75 per cent. I will get the figures right.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FERGUSON" NAMEID="EP5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EP5">Senator Ferguson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You never used to get them right.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We did, absolutely. That figure is well below what the private sector economists believe is the growth rate needed to get unemployment down. The Liberal Party's seemingly house&hyphen;trained economists that advised them on the Fightback policy estimate in their most recently published estimates that unemployment will hit nine per 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cent by about the middle of the year, and that forecast is not an isolated forecast.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have no strategy to deal with unemployment, no sign of a strategy to deal with unemployment. Work for the dole is just putting people who are unemployed in and out of jobs; it is not a strategy to deal with them in the long term. This need not have been the case, because the slashing and burning we have seen in the economy need not have occurred. I repeat that&mdash;they need not have occurred. The Howard government ran a confidence trick on the Australian public to try to sensitise them to the need for massive budget cuts. They need not have occurred, because the deficit in the Australian budget, by world comparisons of developed economies, was low and was repairing itself, and the way to repair it faster would have been to opt for growth in the economy, not to opt, as they did on this occasion, to contract the economy. Of course, those cuts destroyed industry policy, and industry policy supports the ability of industry to grow. Because those cuts have affected industry policy adversely, industries are not growing as rapidly, and that is not surprising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, on the unemployment elements of this budget, I quote the Prime Minister himself. In a 1995 headland speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the government was then the Labor government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">economic projections for the next four years were downgraded below four per cent. This is an admission by the Government that it cannot sustain growth in the range necessary to further substantially reduce unemployment rates . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, what Mr Howard is saying is that you need a growth rate in the economy of four per cent so that when all the school leavers come on the market they get jobs and you eat into the number of people who are still unemployed. What is the forecast for this budget? The forecast is 3.5 per cent growth. So he is half a per cent below the growth level you need to deal with unemployment. That is not a strategy for dealing with the No. 1 most important question in the Australian economy. That is a strategy for ignoring it or for putting it on the backburner and saying 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="588"> that sometime in the distant future it may take care of itself. I must say that when you survey private sector economists, again none of them believe it is likely to be about 3.5 per cent. The majority believe on average that it is going to be around 3.1 per cent&mdash;much reduced below what the budget forecasts are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leads me to the fourth point that I need to make in this debate, and that is that, while we have a mid&hyphen;term review, the mid&hyphen;term review is remarkable in that, if you compare it with what is being said elsewhere by economists whose job it is to forecast changes in the economy, the mid&hyphen;term figures are rubbery. They are rubbery and, I would have to say, unreliable. Let us go to a couple of examples of that. In the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> in January of this year they conducted a survey of 28 economists: 10 bank economists, eight business, academic and policy group economists; and 10 economists who work for stockbrokers or other forecasters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did they estimate? These are people who have the same estimate tools in front of them as does the Treasury. They had a scattering of estimates, but their average is 3.1 per cent economic growth for the budgetary year, whereas the budget forecast is 3.5 per cent. This was the estimate of 28 economists from the leading banks, academia, brokers and other forecasters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In December, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> conducted a similar survey under the heading `Rare accord on next year's growth'. It conducted a survey of 12 economists, some of whom were the same as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>'s economists. What did they concur on average was the growth for the economy? They said 3.1 per cent. The ANZ bank conducted a survey of 20 leading market economists. Again, some of them are the same. What did they say that the GDP growth for the year would be? They said 3.1 per cent. They said that unemployment would be 8.7 per cent&mdash;above the level forecast by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 3 February, the National Australia Bank published their most recent forecast on the economy. What did they forecast for the growth rate in the economy? The forecast of Alan Oster of the National Australia Bank was 2&frac34;per cent. We have here a substantial 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> variation between what the private sector and the professional experts believe is the likely performance of the economy and what Treasury say it is. They are sufficient to raise a substantial doubt about how reliable these figures are and whether they are being put to provide a mere cosmetic argument for the government that growth will be higher than what it will be. So that is where we go as far as growth is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know, in terms of unemployment, that at least one of the major forecasters is forecasting 9 per cent. In summary, those private sector economists say about 8.8 per cent&mdash;again, substantially higher than the government's even now upwardly revised rate of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Private consumption is an important indicator. Private consumption takes up about 60 per cent of GDP in the economy. Private consumption is down. We know that the trading cycle over Christmas was a shocker and we see in the mid&hyphen;term review that private consumption is revised downwards again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The summary of that position is simple. If the government's optimistic figures are realised, the economy will grow at about 3.5 per cent. No&hyphen;one much believes that. They think it is more likely to be a lower growth of about 3 per cent, meaning fewer job opportunities, more unemployment, with the unemployment figure higher, private consumption down and private consumption expected to reel down a couple more steps. This means that, by the end of this budgetary period, the forecast will be totally out of whack, and the budgetary deficit will be a great deal bigger than the forecast now. It will be bigger because people are not in work paying taxes, because we are having to pay unemployment benefits and because people are frightened of the future, and they are not consuming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not the environment for small business and that is not the environment for the economy. It is the environment that this government has foisted on Australians. Australians do not want that environment, and I am sure will reject it. It is a mark of the failure of this government to actually manage the economy as they promised. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

We have had an economics lecture from Senator Cook. These people forget who caused these problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This time last year, Australia was suffering a very public malaise. In fact, the patient was very sick. The symptoms were obvious. Let's have a look at them. There was 11&half; per cent unemployment, the highest since the Depression&mdash;in fact, an average rate of unemployment over 13 years of 8.7 per cent. It was higher than 10 per cent for nearly three years of the previous government. And for 32 consecutive months under Labor, unemployment was its highest since World War II.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How many new full&hyphen;time jobs did this government create&mdash;not people down rabbit burrows on training programs that led them nowhere but kept them off the statistics, those terrible statistics, but real jobs? Was this patient sick! Yet, Senator Schacht in this place on 29 August 1995 proudly said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the support this government has given through Working Nation to tackle long&hyphen;term unemployment, including youth unemployment, is an example that we can all be proud of.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Not me, Senator Schacht and certainly not thousands of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor failed a generation of people and, in particular, a generation of young people, and yet the malaise continued. Ten months ago Australians got the chance to change the doctor and to change the treatment. Thousands of them voted for new specialists to review the problem and to try to speed up the recovery process. So what's happened since then to get Australians working again, and to repair and restore this nation? The coalition has created four times as many full&hyphen;time jobs as Labor in its last five years. There have been three interest rate cuts, the lowest since BW&mdash;before Whitlam; we all remember that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has established a small business task force to look at ways to help remove red tape and compliance costs and the response to that report is due very soon. We 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have reviewed the unfair dismissal laws. We have reformed the IR policies and, very importantly, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has created a cabinet subcommittee to look at unemployment. He has given it his highest priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a new apprenticeship and training scheme to help young people and business and the green corp initiative, a $41 million program, offers great opportunities for young people in our environment. Interestingly enough, within 10 days of advertising vacancies and expressions of interest in this program, there have been 1,100 responses for the 230 initial places to be made available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our latest policy of work for the unemployment benefit has been widely welcomed not only by young people but by their parents, who are very anxious that their children get some work experience to improve their morale and their sense of wellbeing and at the same time, very importantly, to help the community. Still Labor refuse to lend their support to these initiatives. They rather remind me of a group of hypochondriacs, wringing their hands and enjoying the experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In office, Labor tried to disguise just how ill this patient really was. We found the $8 billion black hole that we heard so much about this afternoon only after we came to government. Now, in office, Labor still refuse to lend support for our fresh, new and popular approach.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I am happy to have moved amendment 3 standing in my name, but obviously I am not happy then to prolong the debate for amendments 4 and 5. These amendments effectively prevent the introduction of a revised divisor for calculating the lump sum compensation preclusion period. This, as honourable senators would recall, was something that was again debated at some length during debate on budget measures relating to social security. We opposed this for social security recipients. Our proposals at that time were not successful and we were defeated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I would say that the revised divisor will mean that the lump sum preclusion period will be longer. It will mean that people will be precluded from payment for longer and, of course, will be forced to use up their compensation payment at a lower rate so as to have income for that period. I think the arguments that were advanced on behalf of the opposition when the Senate canvassed these issues at length before still stand. I certainly stand by them, and I urge the majority of senators who did not support the opposition on that occasion to reconsider their votes on this matter. I commend opposition amendment 3 to the Senate and indicate that, after it is dealt with, I will just deal in a pro&hyphen;forma way with opposition amendments 4 and 5 cognately.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I think we now have a clearer picture of what the banks will do in relation to this. In fact, I was very interested to read this comment from an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian </EMPHASIS> of 1&hyphen;2 February:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">It went on to say in the same article that that split rate approach is also being adopted by the ANZ. I just make the point to the committee that this is hardly, to use the minister's words, paying the deeming rate down to the last dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the committee that I know it has been canvassed at great length when we debated the social security package, but I really believe this is why this concession is so important. I ask senators around the chamber again to reconsider the position they took

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicated in my speech in the second reading debate that we would support the government on this. Perhaps it might be useful to get a couple of comments from the minister that would help us. We have chased this one around the mulberry bush for months, as has everyone. My understanding is that a single person with under $2,000 in an account would not have to pay, because of the way the pension is arranged. That amount is under $4,000 for a couple. I would be happy if the minister could confirm that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have to say&mdash;even the minister would agree&mdash;that the point at which I am nervous is the point at which we trust the banks to do the right thing. I am guilty of bashing the banks at times. On this occasion I expect that the minister will be able to exert sufficient pressure on the banks that they will continue to do the right thing. Senator Faulkner has raised a real issue for us&mdash;that is, can we trust the banks in terms of that deeming rate on their deeming accounts? If you could address those couple of issues, Minister, that would help, but at this stage we will be supporting the government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME><STATE> (Tasmania&mdash;</STATE><ROLE>Minister for Social Security and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP>(5.06 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Woodley for his contribution. He is right in his assumption about people who have under $2,000 in their accounts. I also say that I would have concerns too about what the banks' intentions are towards pensioners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the previous government, when deeming was introduced first, pensioners were getting a very raw deal from the banks, in my view. Therefore, as an opposition we supported the introduction of deeming so that pensioners would get a better go and be able to maximise their income. It had the possibility of having some benefits to revenue but, more importantly, it gave them a fair return on their income. Banks were, in fact, borrowing very low from their pensioners and letting their money out very high, and I do not think any 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="594"> of us think that is a great way to treat the elderly in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I said in the debate last year still stands, but I would like to add a few other points. Most deeming accounts offer no interest currently on the first $2,000. But the past experience of the introduction of deeming in the first place is that financial institutions set the rate of interest paid to the deemed rates for deeming accounts in order to remain competitive. This is one of the things that these financial institutions have to take into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These pensioners have an enormous amount of clout. If they are well informed and determined to get a fair go for themselves, they are not silly old men and women, they will move their money where they will get a fair go&mdash;and of course they should, and the government endorses that. We believe these amendments, like the original introduction of deeming, will enable pensioners to increase their overall income. But there has been a dramatic improvement over the last few years in the way the banks have treated pensioners. We believe these amendments will continue that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought you might like some information about the current state of play, Senator Woodley. The total number of institutions currently offering deeming accounts are 121. Of those, 37 currently offer the deeming rate on account balances under $2,000; but none of the major banks offer these accounts as yet. The more sizeable financial institutions that do are Bankwest, Challenge Bank, Town and Country, IOOF and Suncorp Building Society. There are another 19 institutions from the 121 offering deeming accounts that also pay four per cent on account balances below $2,000. However, these 19 do not offer accounts that mirror the deeming rates on larger balances as the 37 indicated above do. However, where people have only small balances to invest, there are a total of 56 accounts available to them currently paying four per cent on balances below $2,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My intention is to make sure, to the best of my ability, as the minister responsible for social security, that all elderly people in our society have access to the most up-to-date information on these financial institutions and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what they are offering. If you like, I think it is an area where we could do a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Choice</EMPHASIS> exercise on the financial institutions, because it is unrealistic to expect elderly people, as Senator West said earlier, to go from bank to bank trying to find out that information. Some elderly people are physically incapacitated and would find doing that difficult and perhaps a little confusing. Nevertheless, I see it as a responsibility that I am happy to shoulder to make sure they have up-to-date information. Perhaps that will also help to make the financial institutions realise that we mean business about giving pensioners a fair go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that as Minister for Social Security, I acknowledge that we are on a veterans bill; but I know that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Scott) has a similar concern to make sure that information goes to pensioners, and he will be doing what he can in that area as well. Of course, you should not forget that we have FIS officers in the Department of Social Security. Elderly people can go and talk to them about their financial position and get advice about maximising their income. We have also set up half a dozen retirement services centres around Australia where there are representatives of Veterans' Affairs, Social Security and Taxation, and older people are finding it very valuable to be able to go and get the advice they need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I think the combination of advice, availability of information and, if you like, the record of financial institutions when deeming was first introduced means that veterans and other pensioners will be much better off as a result of extending the deeming in the way we are doing. Of course, from an administrative point of view it makes it simpler, too, and less confusing for people as to where the deeming cuts in as it does now at $2,000 and $4,000.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill 1996 has two principal purposes. The first is to facilitate cooperation between Australia and other nations to pursue the proceeds of criminal activity. It does so by allowing Australia to pay out the proceeds of crime to foreign nations which have assisted us in the seizure of those proceeds. Further, the bill also allows Australia to receive the proceeds of crime paid to this country by the nations which Australian authorities have assisted to seize proceeds offshore. This aim of the bill of course is entirely laudatory and, on behalf of the opposition, we express our unequivocal support for these measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increasingly, organised crime&mdash;desperate as it is to evade scrutiny&mdash;moves the proceeds of its activities through the world's international monetary system. Money laundering, for instance, particularly if money is obtained through the drug trade, can be done around the world at the blink of an eye, through any one of a number of tax havens, sham transactions or the use of common technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pursuing these assets, of course, can take considerable time and resources. But, at the end of the day, criminals want to enjoy the spoils of their wrongdoings and, sooner or later, their ill-gotten gains wind up in countries where they can be seized&mdash;and seized of course they must be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as the means of the international criminal have become more complex, so too have the investigative techniques and resources available to law enforcement agencies. Just as it is imperative for international law enforcement agencies to cooperate to arrest the criminals themselves, so too is it imperative that the proceeds of their crimes be seized. Any assistance that the Australian government can provide to not only our own but also overseas authorities to seize assets laundered through the international monetary 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="596"> system will clearly help in the greater struggle against these malefactors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his historic speech to the joint sitting of the House of Representatives and the Senate late last year, President Clinton identified the fight against international drug trafficking and against international organised crime as part of the next great challenge facing all nations. President Clinton said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we deal with these challenges to our security, we must recognise the new ones which are emerging and the new approaches they require. Terrorism, international crime and drug trafficking are forces of destruction that have no tolerance for national borders. Together we must show zero tolerance for them . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It means, in short, pursuing a concerted strategy&mdash;intelligence and police co-operation worldwide, co-ordinated action in every country to stop money laundering, shutting down grey markets for guns and false documents, and increasing extraditions. It means security co-ordination . . . and giving, in each of our nations, our law enforcement officials the tools they need to co-operate and succeed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Such cooperation is essential. I do recognise and thank the government for introducing this aspect of the bill before us. It provides a material way through which all parties in this parliament can reaffirm their commitment to this most important struggle. The commitment to war against drugs and organised crime must be more than just words. As the President said, we must give all `our law enforcement officials the tools they need'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with great disappointment that I turn to the second aspect of this bill. Item 6 of schedule 1 of the bill repeals section 34D of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 and it inserts a new provision. The purpose of this amendment to the act is to allow the government to transfer funds distributable from the confiscated assets trust fund to consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, funds seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act are paid into the trust fund until such time as any legal proceedings in relation to those funds are determined. When the Commonwealth is successful in proving that those funds or assets are the proceeds of crime, those funds are distributable for the purposes of the act.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the establishment of this trust fund, some $29.8 million has been paid in, $26.4 million of which has been as a result of funds seized pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. A further $3.3 million has been paid in pursuant to the Customs Act 1901 and $22,000 pursuant to section 9 of the Crimes Act 1914. As at 31 July this year, the trust fund had a total of $7.25 million credited to it, of which $5.9 million was available for distribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the present legislation as it now operates, available funds are distributed once per year by the Attorney-General for two purposes. Half the funds are available for the funding of special law enforcement projects. In 1995, funding of about $5.4 million was paid out of the trust fund to some 10 law enforcement projects. These projects, quite meritorious, included, for instance, $450,000 to enhance the Insurance and Superannuation Commission's fraud detection system; $290,000 to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs' movement alert system, a system which has been recently upgraded and which was designed to detect and monitor the attempted movement of undesirables to Australia; and some $1.8 million to the NCA, the National Crime Authority, to assist with its telecommunications intercept capabilities&mdash;another important project. Other recipients included the AFP, the Australian Securities Commission and the Australian Institute of Criminology. In the 1994 funding round, a further $5.2 million was distributed to some 20 law enforcement projects in sums ranging from $54,500 to $675,000. Recipients included the Australian Customs Service and the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It cannot be denied that, collectively, all those measures have provided an invaluable boost to Australia's law enforcement capabilities. That can be said collectively and individually. These measures have also been quite critical to the agencies that have been able to benefit from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other 50 per cent of funds are available for drug education and rehabilitation projects. Since 1992-93, the Department of Health and Family Services has received a net total of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="597"> $7.638 million from the trust fund, $11.68 million gross. These moneys have also been used for quite valuable projects. They have been used to support, for instance, additional projects under the national drug strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth remembering what sorts of projects we are talking about here, and remembering that, in the future, funding will not be available for these sorts of projects. Activities funded during the period I mentioned include: the second phase of the `Speed catches up with you' public education awareness campaign, a critical campaign which was designed to promote awareness about the effect of amphetamines; an international conference held in Sydney in June 1994 on the principles of developing and implementing a balanced national drug strategy to address the problems of drug abuse; a program which involved the production of a general resource document on the health effects of cannabis and a time series analysis of the patterns and use of and community attitudes towards that drug; a technical study of the toxic effects of MDMA, otherwise known as Ecstasy; and the national initiatives in drug education, NIDE, program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This NIDE program consisted of two phases: the ongoing comprehensive training of teachers to develop both skills and knowledge in relation to drug education and, subsequently, the extension of this education to parents, industry and community groups. As I say, these are quite invaluable programs in terms of raising awareness in our community about some particular drugs and generally about drugs and other substance abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trust fund has also been used in the past to supplement the budget of the national drug strategy when funds were otherwise unavailable. In two years the base funding of the strategy was supplemented by $2 million advances against future allocations from the trust fund. The use of these advances explains the $4 million differential between net and gross figures I mentioned earlier for allocations from the trust fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, these programs have all been valuable. They have increased awareness of the impact of drugs in our community. They 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have provided us with the resources that we need to tackle difficult and complex problems. So what now is the problem? What is wrong with these funds being transferred to consolidated revenue rather than directly to these projects? There is of course a fundamental problem with that. At a time when government is cutting back on funding, particularly in the Attorney-General's Department, there will not be funding around for programs like this in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has tried to defend the decision to transfer these funds to consolidated revenue on two bases, firstly, by arguing that the hypothecation of these funds for law enforcement purposes may divert law enforcement agencies from their primary goal of law enforcement. The Attorney-General stated in the House of Representatives on 9 December 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Distortion of the operations of law enforcement agencies will result if the focus is too much on the recovery of funds rather than on the prevention of crime and the apprehension of criminals.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I find this particular approach insulting to the commitment demonstrated daily by our law enforcement officials. It is insulting to suggest that they would be more interested in increasing the budgets of their respective organisations than pursuing criminals. I hope the Attorney-General did not mean that, but the interpretation of his words, I think, is quite clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But such remarks also ignore the operation of the trust fund as it now stands. No law enforcement agency would reasonably be tempted in this way because any funds paid out from the trust fund are paid out, firstly, at the discretion of the Attorney and not necessarily to the agency that collects the funds and, secondly, a considerable time after the funds were placed in the trust fund in the first place. Both of these factors mean that no agency would seriously rely upon funds placed in the trust fund as a source of future funding. The Attorney's suggestions in this regard shows, I think, his complete failure to understand how the trust fund currently operates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also tries to defend this proposal by saying that the mere transfer of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="598"> the funds available under the trust fund to consolidated revenue will not stop funds being available for these purposes. I am sure that is what the minister, when she comes into this chamber, will say in her defence. In debate in the House of Representatives, Mr Williams stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is not to say that there will not be funding directed to law enforcement projects and to drug rehabilitation and education programs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But the budget makes a lie of that assertion. Across the board it cannot be disputed that this government has cut appropriations to our law enforcement agencies. The Australian Federal Police will have its budget cut by some $26.5 million over the next two years. The Australian Customs Service will be cut by $73 million over four years. Cuts already announced to the Customs Service have resulted in a loss of adequate border protection in many major regional centres and the virtual conversion of the Australian Customs Service to a 9 to 5 operation. If only criminals worked office hours!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Crime Authority, Australia's premier law enforcement agency in the fight against organised crime, will have its budget cut by $11.3 million over the next three years&mdash;almost 20 per cent of its budget. That is a cut which the chairman of the NCA, Mr John Broome, has already admitted will, far from making the NCA more efficient as claimed in the government's election commitments, reduce the authority's investigative capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will be particularly noticeable in my home state of South Australia and in the state of Western Australia. Staff at the authority's Adelaide office are being reduced from&mdash;you just cannot believe this!&mdash;33 to only 10. In Perth staff numbers will be cut from 27 to 15. That is an enormous cutback in those states, states which have drug problems and organised crime problems, and a cutback which in no way has been attempted to be justified by the Attorney&mdash;33 to 10 in the South Australian office of the NCA and 27 to 15 in WA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say in fairness to other officers of the NCA who have been affected by these cuts that a further 20 staff have lost their jobs in Melbourne, 12 in Sydney and three in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Brisbane. However, when you look at those figures the relative impact of these cuts will be most noticeable in the Adelaide and Perth offices. There has been no justification for that. There has been no pretence of trying to explain that maybe there has been a reduction in the incidence of crime and organised crime in those two states. In fact, those states will now be left mainly unprotected because of this enormous cutback in their staff contingents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know how the Attorney justifies that. How you could exclude South Australia and WA from priority areas in terms of the fight against drug importation and organised crime is something which is quite incredible. All Australians should be concerned that this government has given the drug barons and crime lords a green light in South Australia and the West. I do say as a South Australian that South Australians are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also cut half a million dollars, some 15 per cent, from the budget of the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board. You wonder how that body will continue to effectively assist Commonwealth and state law enforcement bodies coordinate their activities after a cut of this magnitude, particularly since last year the Commonwealth added to the responsibilities of CLEB the coordination of the new uniform national gun laws as well as the national paedophile register and the National Missing Persons Bureau. It is law enforcement on the cheap. We really should not tolerate it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the government has cut another $160,000 from research on the criminal justice response to violence against women. This funding had been announced under the previous Labor government's justice statement. So despite all the posturing before the election about the need to protect women from domestic violence, this government has actually turned around and cut funding to a program that would help us all to understand, so as to fix, one of the principal reasons why too many women choose not to report domestic violence. Of course the problem is the criminal justice system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In total, what we are talking about here is a cutback in the federal budget of some $120 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="599"> million out of Australia's fight against crime. So much for giving our law enforcement officials the resources they need. So much for giving Australian families the protection they need. So much for giving Australian young people the protection they need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to give the government some credit where it is due. The only new spending proposal in the law and order field is the government's establishment of the national campaign against violence and crime. The additional $3 million to be allocated over the next three years is a welcome addition to the $1 million per year announced in the justice statement for the safer Australia program. I must also indicate a disappointment that that $3 million is less than the $5 million promised to the Australian people by the coalition in its law and justice policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on, but it saddens me to say that in terms of programs like safer Australia there needs to be a continuing commitment here. In terms of those programs and the programs I mentioned earlier, I think there is an increasing responsibility on the government to ensure that funding resources are available. So it is disappointing. The Attorney's handling of this program&mdash;like so many other areas in his portfolio&mdash;has been lackadaisical to say the least.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What can we conclude about the government's law and order budget? Whilst no-one would suggest that this government actively supports organised crime, its inaction, its negligence and its lack of commitment mark it out as a government that really does not have the fortitude for the fight. In the realm of law and order, the budget represents a litany of broken promises and lies. Mr Williams and Mr Howard have betrayed the Australian people. In doing so they have put ordinary Australians, particularly younger Australians and Australian families, in the firing line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their record on drug education and rehab is not much better either. What we are talking about here is a cessation of funding to sound and proven programs&mdash;programs that reduce the likelihood of crimes, not just drug related crimes, being committed in the future. The drug culture in Australia is surrounded by the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> commission of property offences and violent crimes. A large proportion of home break&hyphen;ins in this country, for instance, are carried out by drug users seeking cash or readily saleable goods, such as VCRs and Cds, to fund their habits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all too regularly talk about drug related killings, not to mention the often high level of non&hyphen;lethal violence that permeates drug culture. Prostitution, youth homelessness and abuse are all too often connected with the prevalence of drugs in our community. This government's withdrawal of funding, which either stops young Australians entering this unsavoury world or helps drug users kick the habit, will only see this blight on our society spread.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we believe that this aspect of the bill is ill-conceived and short-sighted. In this government's desperate dash for cash, it has lost sight of the reason why we are elected to government: to make Australia a safer and happier place for us all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amount involved in this bill is a miserly $12.83 million over four years. Even if we make the assumption, which I do not believe we can make, that all moneys currently held in the trust fund will be ultimately distributable, that is the amount you are talking about. Small though these amounts might be, in total these funds provide much needed additional assistance to our law enforcement agencies and help those who are otherwise tempted by drugs and help them to say no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in the committee stage of this bill&mdash;and I do not think I will speak to the amendment at this stage&mdash;I will move an amendment to omit from the bill item 6 of schedule 1. A similar amendment was moved in the House of Representatives, and I do ask senators to support this particular amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also indicate in closing that the opposition will support the bill but, once again, we ask the government to really reconsider what they are doing in respect of the confiscated assets trust fund. It is a dash for cash. It is one that really cannot be justified and one that leaves Australian families and Australian young people unprotected from the growing evils, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="600"> not the lessening evils, of international organised crime.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on behalf of my colleague Senator Bourne, who was responsible for this bill, and on behalf of the Democrats to discuss the Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill 1996. As we have heard, there are two purposes to this bill. The first purpose enables the Commonwealth to distribute the proceeds of crime to a foreign country or to receive proceeds of crime from a foreign country where that country has assisted Australia in criminal matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act already allows for the Commonwealth to divide the proceeds of crime within an Australian state or territory if those proceeds have been recovered with their assistance. This is something that we consider entirely appropriate. As we understand it, the provision to allow for the sharing with a foreign country shall operate in a similar manner. Again, the Australian Democrats find this entirely appropriate. Indeed, this clause may add an incentive to a foreign country to assist Australia in its law enforcement operations for criminal matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Democrats do not have a problem with that particular section of the bill, and we will support it. But, like Senator Bolkus, we do have a problem with the second provision in the bill that allows for the redirection of funds from the confiscated assets trust fund away from law enforcement and drug rehabilitation and education programs into consolidated revenue. That is, under the new section, any money in the consolidated assets trust fund available for distribution will go into consolidated revenue. We consider that entirely inappropriate, and we will not be supporting that particular section of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1991 all assets recovered under the Proceeds of Crime Act and the narcotic provisions of the Customs Act were paid into the fund. Currently, the Attorney-General must also decide what proportion of the fund is available for distribution. Then half of the balance is paid to law enforcement projects, as selected by the Attorney-General. The other half is to be paid to drug rehabilitation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and drug education projects chosen by the minister for health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through the fund, the law enforcement sector has been able to increase its ability to investigate and arrest drug importers. The Australian Federal Police, the Australian Securities Commission and the Australian Institute of Criminology have also been recipients of grants from the confiscated assets trust fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think anyone would deny the importance and the value of these particular projects of which Senator Bolkus has outlined. Of course, drug rehabilitation and education projects have been proven as a way and a method for reducing the incidence of drug abuse in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some examples have been mentioned, but there are also others apart from the `Speed catches up with you' amphetamine awareness campaign. There have been studies on community attitudes to drug taking. There has been teacher training in drug related issues. Other examples include the production of health related resource materials, technical studies on the side effects of drugs and international conferences on implementing the national drug strategy. Senator Bolkus mentioned the `Say no to drugs' campaign; perhaps we should have a `Say no to section 34D' campaign in relation to this bill. But no&hyphen;one doubts the worth and the importance of these particular drug education and rehabilitation programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As of July 1996, the fund had a total of $7.25 million in credit of which $5.9 million was available for distribution. Comparatively, this is not a great deal of money but, of course, it is a lot of money when it is put in the context of drug education and health programs. So the Democrats are questioning the government today as to why it seems so keen on saving a pitiful $7.25 million in this budget and a miserly $1.86 million each year until the year 2000 by transferring the proceeds of crime to consolidated revenue. We regard this amendment to the Proceeds of Crime Act as no more than a pitiful money&hyphen;grabbing exercise by the government. I mean, $7.25 million is the total amount that the confiscated assets trust fund currently con 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="601"> tains. I have no doubt that the transfer to consolidated revenue would mean that the government would not necessarily be planning to fund those vitally important drug and health related education programs because it has certainly not topped up the budgets of other relevant agencies to make up the shortfall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bolkus has referred to the cuts that have been made in other crime fighting and investigative agencies, such as the National Crime Authority. Senator Conroy, as a colleague on the National Crime Authority committee, would share the concerns that Senator Bolkus has already outlined about the drastic and dramatic impact on their budget as a result of the budget cuts. Of course, in my home state of South Australia, as I am sure the minister would be aware, I am very concerned that the reduction in staff&mdash;from 33 to 10&mdash;in the National Crime Authority office will have a deleterious impact on investigative work in that agency and on other crime fighting ones. Again, budget cuts to Customs, to the police, the NCA and to the justice system&mdash;the legal aid system generally in this country&mdash;will have a negative impact on crime fighting in this nation. As Senator Bolkus pointed out, that will affect the most vulnerable in society certainly through the massive legal aid cuts as we are already seeing the impact of those particular cuts. Indeed, as he said, young people will be particularly affected and hit hardest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think one of the most offensive things about this debate is that too often we hear policy&hyphen;makers and politicians talking about young Australians and drug taking and the effects of drug taking or stereotyping and denigrating young people as criminals in our society. In fact, as a young person in New South Wales you have got a better chance of getting in the paper if you commit a crime than for any other reason. Certainly I would not find this debate so offensive if the government met its rhetoric about concern for drugs and the impact on young people in our society and if it actually matched that with some funding for education and rehabilitation programs. Essentially, this government, through a pathetic attempt to save 0.005 per 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cent of the total budget outlay, is prepared to give up important drug related education programs and thus deny our law enforcement sector from being able to increase its ability to catch drug importers as well as research important criminal justice issues. It is a regretful stance. The Democrats do not support it and we certainly do not support the proposed new section 34D.</PARA></SPEECH>

I wish to raise the question of one particular program and I will refer you to the fact that Australia is on a body targeting money laundering through the OECD. We do, in fact, fund our involvement in this program through the OECD through money provided under the confiscated assets trust fund mechanism. That project has the objective of ensuring that the money laundering agencies set up in South&hyphen;East Asia can be targeted through the free exchange of information between law enforcement agencies. My advice also is that this program, which is quite important in terms of ensuring a coordinated network between law enforcement agencies in the region, will not be funded in the future. I wonder if you can give us some advice on that. Is the funding for that program being stopped? Is there a guarantee that it will be continued as a short&hyphen;term program?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My concern is that the people involved were under an apprehension that there would be continuing funding for at least a further part of the involvement in the program and that the project has now been told that the money is going back to consolidated revenue&mdash;obviously through this legislation providing that funds go to consolidated revenue. I might have a bit more information. That extra information is that there was an expectation that Australia's involvement in a body targeting money laundering through the OECD, and particularly focusing on our region, will be ended prematurely because of this legislation going through and the government's budget decision to rip the money out of the program and to put it into consolidated revenue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a couple of matters that I would like to raise lest anyone reading <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  or listening is under some misunderstanding. Senator Bolkus quite rightly raises the question of money laundering practices with the change in the trends of crime being committed. Money laundering is a very serious matter which any government would rightly give appropriate attention to. Simply because, as he believes he has been advised, one element of funding for some concentration on money laundering is not going to continue, it certainly does not mean that the government is not interested in money laundering and that everything will fall apart. I do not suggest for a minute that Senator Bolkus is making that suggestion. But I wanted to underline very briefly that this government does take its law enforcement role very seriously and recognises the importance of chasing money that is meant to be laundered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, the next point that I would like to make in respect of this is that the government also believes that it should be the government of the day that decides the amount of money that goes to law enforcement and, for that matter, to drug rehabilitation programs, and it should not really be a matter of luck as to whom you have been able to confiscate some assets from. Some senators opposite might argue that that is a moot point. I do not think it is at all. In a sense, what Senator Bolkus is proposing leaves us with a semi bounty hunter type of attitude where, if you chase the people with more money, you will get more money, which means that they are the people who will be chased and not perhaps some other crimes that have equal, if 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="603"> not more substantial, effects on individual Australians. So, I am reasonably confident that the proposition that Senator Bolkus is putting is no longer appropriate. I think it was initially introduced on the basis of giving law enforcement agencies incentive because some of the money, in the end, would come back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in the end, the Australian people elect a government. They elect a government in the lower house and, for better or worse, they elect a Senate as well. The Senate has the capacity to say, `Look, I am sorry' and to use the political process to be critical about how a government is spending its money, and that is the process that we want to return to. We think this is appropriate rather than saying to law enforcement agencies&mdash;and, in effect, offering them a carrot&mdash;`Come this way and there will be money.' What about the other path that might be equally appropriate to follow&mdash;that of the other criminal where there is not as much money? Is that person going to get less attention because the other guy has got more money? I think that is a serious problem with your suggestion, Senator Bolkus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise a third point, rather than get up again, and Senator Stott Despoja might be able to help me: as I am advised by one of the Attorney's advisers, the Democrats, on having a briefing on this bill, indicated that they were prepared to support it, and they have now changed their minds. If that is the case, I would be very grateful, Senator, if you could give an indication of why it is the case?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With all due respect to the minister, I think she does not know what she is talking about. I say that because she was not here for the second reading debate. She came in at the end and she may have missed some of the points that were made in debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way this trust fund works is that the money received through seizure of assets of those involved in the crimes that are subject to the scheme is put in trust and it is at the discretion of the Attorney&hyphen;General as to where the money goes. The agency can in no way be seen to be a bounty hunter and I would object to a bounty hunter arrangement. But we are talking here of money seized, money 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> confiscated&mdash;50 per cent of the money going to law enforcement agencies for programs and projects and 50 per cent going towards primarily community sectors for items such as drug education, research into the impacts of drugs and so on. No&hyphen;one knowing these facts would, in any sense at all, argue that we are talking here of bounty hunters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mention, for instance, the immigration department's development of the MAL system. This alert system, which has been upgraded quite substantially over the last three or four years, taps into new technology to ensure that Australia has state&hyphen;of&hyphen;art technology, mechanisms, structures and operations that can protect us against the movement into Australia of terrorists, drug runners and the like. These sorts of programs are pretty important and money for them was found through this particular trust fund. That is one example of it. The education programs and the research into ecstasy are quite critical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, we are not talking here of bounty hunters; we are talking here of a scheme which in so many diverse ways over the years has provided quite a number of millions of dollars to ensure that we can upgrade our community infrastructure to protect against drug runners and organised crime and upgrade our community support structure, particularly for young people and families, who may very well be the victims of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Minister, for you to come in here saying that this is a scheme which leads us to a system of bounty hunters is quite inappropriate. Though it might reflect the comments made by the Attorney&hyphen;General in the House of Representatives when this bill was passed there, to some extent I am pleased to say that he was not as gauche as you in accusing organisations of being bounty hunters. He was concerned that there might be an extra incentive. But, as I say, the money does not go back to the agency; the money goes into a fund and the Attorney&hyphen;General determines where those resources can be best spent. With that mechanism in place, you can protect against the bounty hunter aspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point is that we are talking here of an area which is a growth area. We are not talking here of an area which has a shelf life 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="604"> or a decreasing role in our community; we are talking here of an area which has an increasing role. It affects all parts of the country&mdash;all regional centres as well as the capital cities. It is not just Kings Cross and Fitzroy Street that are hit by this; it is all over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of organised crime, no longer are we talking about the real crime of concern to law enforcement authorities being something in our suburbs, something based in one city or something in our backyard. It has got regional and international implications. Drug running and money laundering are part of an international network. So do not try to argue that this program had a limited time span. It was always going to have a very strong imperative in terms of community concern for such a program to continue.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are legitimate arguments for both the position taken by Senator Bolkus and the position taken by the government. I am inclined to the position taken by the government because, whilst the funds would be distributed at the discretion of the Attorney-General&mdash;that is the current situation&mdash;why should that be so? Why should the Attorney-General set priorities for law enforcement or for programs which may be research programs that he has an interest in? Is this not a responsibility for the government as a whole? The education minister might have a better application for certain of the confiscated moneys which are the proceeds of crime. Why should it be the Attorney-General? Where is this going to end?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I get the impression sometimes&mdash;I perish the thought, of course&mdash;that some of these speed traps are a little bit excessive. In other words, they seem to be to my mind revenue collection measures rather than anything else. That is probably a prejudicial observation which I should not make. Nevertheless, I am just wondering where it all goes to. I know that at the present moment it goes to consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bolkus, I said&mdash;and maybe you were discussing the matter with some of your own people&mdash;that I understand the point you make. I think there are genuinely held views on both sides of this argument, but I am inclined to the view of the government on this&mdash;that is, to repeal section 34D and add new section 34D which is before us.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am disappointed that Senator Harradine is taking that position, but it is not surprising given that we have had some 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="605"> indication of it. I would like to comment on the issue Senator Harradine raised of speed traps. It raises the role of law enforcement agencies and whether we should be using them as revenue raising institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about the proceeds of crime, we are talking about a very legitimate and probably increasingly important role of law enforcement agencies: that is, to seize the assets of drug runners and money launderers. It is only when you start seizing their assets that you make an impact on their organisations. That is why I think this is an important measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, as I come from South Australia, I cannot help thinking every time I drive through Adelaide that I am in a police state. Everywhere I go there is a speed camera. People doing 71 kilometres per hour in a 60 kilometre zone are hit with a bill of $117, and that is a normal occurrence. I do not think there is any pretence in that state any longer about those speed cameras being there as a revenue raiser. I do not think that is a legitimate use of the police force in that state. Where people speed in areas that are notorious for accidents, I think it is legitimate to use speed cameras.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a legitimate demand and expectation on behalf of the public that there be some warning of speed traps. But technology has moved on so far that the balance is now in the hands of those who have the cameras. You have to ask whether what they are doing is legitimate in terms of reducing the road toll. If speed cameras reduce the road toll in the areas in which they are used, then obviously they have a legitimate purpose. However, too often police resources are deployed for a revenue raising measure rather than the public benefit of a reduction in road tolls and accident rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I often think that those police who are raising money for government and who are not really making an impact on the road toll would be better deployed in traditional roles such as being on the beat, protecting communities and pursuing drug runners. In some senses, I think it is a misuse of resources. There is a role for it, but in the case of South Australia it has gone too far. Those police 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would probably be better served doing something else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is about the confiscation of assets and the deployment of confiscated assets from organised crime to enhance the monitoring systems and the law enforcement capabilities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise for the delay. I did not realise that the bill was coming on. As I understand it, we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="606"> are discussing the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Waiting Period) Bill 1996.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first Howard budget included a series of measures which will slash some $527 million in total from spending on student assistance over the period of the forward estimates. These measures include increasing the age of independence for receipt of Austudy benefits from 22 to 25 years, which is expected to save some $241 million over four years; the particularly petty pair of measures seeking to stop payment for schooling incidentals allowance for secondary students on the homeless rate of Austudy and to cease case management of secondary students on the homeless rate, which will involve some $25.5 million over four years and which, of course, is especially galling; and the measure which we are dealing with in this bill which is also obnoxious and which we intend to oppose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government intends to introduce a 104-week waiting period for access to Austudy for newly arrived migrants. Introduction of this waiting period is expected to lead to savings of some $5.6 million in 1996-97, some $12.3 million in 1997-98, $12.6 million in 1998&hyphen;99, and some $13 million in the year 1999&hyphen;2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this bill is passed, most categories of migrants&mdash;including New Zealand citizens&mdash;who arrive in Australia after 1 January next year will be subject to the two&hyphen;year waiting period. This measure is part of an overall package of changes in this area, most of which apply to social security payments. The coalition did say before the election that they would introduce a two-year waiting period for certain payments. But they also specified that certain areas of payment would be exempt from the ambit of these measures, and these of course included Austudy. This is yet another clear example of a broken promise, something for which this government has now made itself somewhat famous&mdash;or, more to the point, infamous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole structure of the income support which was built up under the previous government was aimed at creating a comprehensive security safety net which included the many payments made under social security and also the payments made through the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs&mdash;payments such as Austudy, Abstudy and assistance for isolated children. This structure was designed to minimise the likelihood of the development in this country of an underclass of destitute people cut off from what would be regarded as normal and appropriate opportunities in life and reasonable standards for a civilised society&mdash;and was designed especially to provide vital opportunities such as access to education and assistance for education purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor introduced a six-month waiting period for certain payments, it is true. It did this, on the one hand, in order to strike some reasonable balance between creating a deterrent to people seeking to migrate inappropriately but also, on the other hand, to avoid a situation where people were deprived of any source of support for protracted periods of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is proposing `from six months to two years,' which is a huge difference and an unjustifiable leap. It has not been preceded by any thought or consideration other than, clearly, a determination to secure some revenue implications. It once again indicates this government's failure to understand how education is the key to national prosperity and social harmony, as well as being a key ingredient for individual fulfilment and attainment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to think about how all of these important decisions are going to come together. There is provision under the government's proposal that people may be able to access special benefits within the two-year period if they can demonstrate some unforeseen or unforeseeable change of circumstances. This is an extremely difficult test and, if they pass it, they will be able to assess only the most basic rate of special benefit, plus the very low rate of basic family payment over and above that, but not the additional level of family payment which is available for people on low incomes and which is highly targeted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to remember that one of the payments we are talking about here is Austudy, which is designed to provide access 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="607"> to education. The people most likely to be affected by the provision of this bill are dependent high school and university aged children in migrant families. Why should they be penalised for a decision made by their parents?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we should not be looking for commonsense in any of the decisions being made by this government. Commonsense certainly does not underlie most of the changes the government is trying to make to student assistance. It is seeking to deny the independence rate of Austudy to students under 25. The Labor government lowered the independence rate to 22 years. Given the absurdity of trying to claim that a person aged 24 is, or somehow still should be, dependent on parental support, this is obviously John Howard's way of keeping the family together and saving the government money&mdash;and I think saving the government money is really the high priority here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is it about these changes that we see most clearly? That saving money immediately, taking it out of the pockets of the `battlers'&mdash;as they are called by this government&mdash;is what this government is really all about when you look at their actions in the detail. Yes, Mr Howard is keen on taking money out of the pockets of those who can least afford it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is even more silly is that this sort of approach is also counterproductive in the long run. Not investing in education and not giving people access to education is more likely in the long run to cost money, not save it. It is also more likely to cost individuals emotionally as well as financially. It will cost this country culturally, socially and economically; and it will cost individuals in personal terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing this sort of behaviour from this government almost everywhere we look. Labour market programs which address English language programs and help migrants to become job ready have also been substantially cut. What is to replace them? The fact is that without basic skills, such as reasonable English proficiency, people are much less likely to be able to find employment; and without the sort of assistance provided by Austudy, which this legislation seeks to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> restrict, we are simply worsening the educational disadvantage faced by people from non-English speaking backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government should open its eyes before it is too late. We in the Labor Party have major concerns about this legislation, and we will not be supporting it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unfortunate that the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Waiting Period) Bill 1996 comes on the tail of the debate that we have had about the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996 this morning. It concerns me that, for the second time in as many days, I am standing to talk about discrimination on the basis of someone's race, specifically discrimination against migrants, and that I am having to point out the same concerns to the government. This legislation conflicts with the basic issues of justice and race. I am sorry that they continue to be a feature of the legislation before this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Waiting Period) Bill 1996 introduces a two&hyphen;year waiting period for access to Austudy which will apply to newly migrants in Australia after January 1997. In the same way that we were disappointed with the measures contained in the social security legislation, the Democrats find this a mean spirited, penny pinching piece of legislation that is actually motivated by revenue considerations rather than considerations of basic fairness and social equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme will pick on those most socially disempowered and economically disadvantaged, as well as showing considerable discrimination, I believe, by stratifying our society. We only have to look at the positions that were presented to this chamber today and last night. Senator Harradine changed his vote on some of the social security measures which were to apply two&hyphen;year waiting period. He expressed his concern and his fear that, if the Senate insisted on certain amendments, we might find ourselves in a double dissolution election situation, and thus people would be going to an election based on the politics of division and race.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="608">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have mentioned over the last few days and again this morning, we objected to the mean spirited nature of those measures as, indeed, we object to the particular measures relating to Austudy. Underpinning this, of course, is the Democrats' consistent support for access to student financial assistance by migrants in this society, in this community, as well as by all other people living in this country. We believe it is a measure to which students should be entitled once they  meet certain qualifications and certain eligibility criteria. For that reason, it is very distressing that this two&hyphen;year waiting period is being applied to Austudy as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw the social security measures this morning. We have seen the same mean spirited thrust with the regulations to do with sponsorship eligibility. We had that debate in this place last year. The Democrats believe that these legislative programs bring into question the government's protestations about racism in this country, and that they challenge the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to racial tolerance. I remind this chamber that, on 30 October 1996, this parliament made a joint statement on racial tolerance. On page 6065 it states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this house:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Reaffirms its commitment to maintaining an immigration policy wholly non&hyphen;discriminatory on grounds of race, colour, creed or origin.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For the term `origin' to have any meaning in this parliament, it must apply equally to migrants. For this reason, the parliament should adhere to the joint statement and accept that denying benefits to newly arrived migrants is a form of discrimination on the basis of their origin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken a number of times on the discriminatory legislation that has come before this parliament. I repeat what I said for the benefit of the government. Over statutory rule 211, I said that honourable senators will appreciate that, in the recent political climate, it is absolutely essential that not only are government principles non&hyphen;discriminatory, but there must also be a reasonable perception that they are. When I talk about discrimination, I am referring to what we all understand 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the term to mean&mdash;that is, as set out in the Racial Discrimination Act, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is unlawful for a person to do any act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of any human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Section 10 of the Racial Discrimination Act says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If, by reason of, or of a provision of, a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, persons of a particular race, colour or national or ethnic origin do not enjoy a right that is enjoyed by persons of another race, colour or national or ethnic origin, or enjoy a right to a more limited extent than persons or another race, colour or national or ethnic origin, then, notwithstanding anything in that law, persons of the first&hyphen;mentioned race, colour or national or ethnic origin shall, by force of this section, enjoy that right to the same extent as persons of that other race, colour or national or ethnic origin.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For the purposes of the present bill, this means that, when a person is eligible for social security benefits&mdash;in this case student assistance benefits&mdash;eligibility for a migrant will be prevented by these particular amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill proposes that a person who migrates to Australia will be denied student financial assistance to which all other eligible Australians will be entitled. The only factor that distinguishes every other Australian in relation to these benefits is that the person is a migrant. The Australian Democrats will be opposing this bill because of its discriminatory impact and its effects on migrants. I call on other senators to reject this bill for those reasons as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the issue of Austudy generally, and the fact that this government has failed to meet its election pledges in relation to funding assistance for Australian students. Most recently we have seen the actual means test hit hardest at the most vulnerable families&mdash;those in rural and remote areas. They have had difficulties in the actual means test calculation. As a consequence of their including anticipated Austudy income as well as anticipated boarding school costs, et cetera, it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="609"> seems that they have been pushed over the threshold, and thus eligibility, for certain Austudy benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that student financial assistance in this country is at a meagre level. We know that in order to obtain the independent rate of Austudy, you have to meet incredibly stringent criteria. The maximum level of Austudy and the independent Austudy rate is only around 68 per cent of the poverty line. Indeed, the majority of students who are on Austudy in this country are living on around 35 per cent of the poverty line. In fact, student financial measures in this country are bleak enough without restricting even further access to such benefits by the bill before us today by imposing a 104&hyphen;week waiting period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Senate chamber both this morning and over the last couple of days we heard evidence from community groups such as FECCA and from various heads of the ethnic communities councils and state and other representative ethnic organisations, including Ms Angela Chan and Victor Rebikoff, explaining how these measures to do with student financial assistance, along with other social security changes involving a two-year waiting period, will hit hardest at the most vulnerable in our community and women and other migrants in many cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The biggest perception that has floated around this debate, not just during the last few days but last year when the legislation was introduced originally, was the notion that somehow migrants do not pay their way in our society and that somehow migrants are not contributing economically or in other forms. Indeed, I think it is important that we knock the assumptions on the head that migrants are bludgers or that they come to this country and then access benefits to which they should not be entitled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, we know that migrants contribute economically in other ways indirectly and directly through taxation and through meeting a series of character and health and other economic checks, including the provisions of assurances of support. So it is not as if we have people who are coming to this country for the sole reason of obtaining certain social security benefits or student financial assist 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ance. These people are only obtaining these benefits in certain and special circumstances when they are, indeed, at their most needy and vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I am concerned that the motivation behind this bill, taken in context with the other social security measures that we have dealt with in the last few days, does not save large amounts of money for the government but, in fact, in this case would have a deleterious impact on migrants who are hoping to enter into and pursue education at secondary and higher levels in this country. To cut off those opportunities for anyone in our society, let alone newly arrived migrants, is unfortunate. For that reason, the Australian Democrats will not be supporting these measures.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Waiting Period) Bill introduces a two&hyphen;year or 104&hyphen;week waiting period for newly arrived migrants seeking Austudy. The bill goes hand in hand with the Department of Social Security legislation, bringing in a two-year waiting period for all Department of Social Security benefits. The bill applies to all migrants after they apply for permanent residency after 1 January this year. If a migrant comes to Australia but does not apply for permanent residency, the wait can actually be longer than two years because the two-year time frame only starts once they are permanent residents. On top of this, if a migrant goes overseas for any period of time&mdash;this could include a funeral&mdash;that time spent abroad must be added to the two-year period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are potentials for an out. If someone can prove change of circumstances, they might be eligible for a special benefit. An example of hardship is when the circumstances of someone under the age of 21 change and they no longer have parental support. Perhaps we could indicate that that causes a great magnitude in need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the ALP was in government they brought in a six&hyphen;month waiting period for New Zealand citizens. So they have done it as well but at a different level. The new system will keep New Zealand citizens on a six-month waiting period. Future migrants 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="610"> from New Zealand will also have to wait two years, like other migrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is quite simple. We do not see a lot of point trying to amend it because it is mostly made up of definitions&mdash;such things as resident, partner, spouse and visa categories and dependant child. So, therefore, we will be opposing the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition talks a lot about broken promises. I have never pushed the idea of a mandate but prior to the election the coalition said it would bring in a two-year waiting period but that Austudy would be exempt from this. Here we go&mdash;another broken promise! Don't try claiming a mandate for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is pretty hard to deny that there is the poll&hyphen;driven scapegoatism that this tends to ride on. It tends to be involved with the level of uncertainty that many people face. People often talk about industry uncertainty, but this just adds to the uncertainty that many people in our community face. It is also an example of hip pocket nationalism. I am sure that the polling being done by the Liberal Party and the coalition is showing that this is a popular measure&mdash;a popular measure to hit migrants. Once again, it finds somebody to blame other than economic policy and the flood of internationalism which has occurred in the last few years, which is changing life for many people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is an example of when citizens are treated merely as consumers under user pays public services. We lose the notion of citizenship and citizens. As permanent residents, they should have the same rights as citizens. In international law permanent residents should not be denied the same rights and freedoms as the citizens of the same country. That is under the treaty in education, for instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens opposed the measure in the budget in 1993 that was brought in by the ALP that permanent residents should be denied Austudy. We consistently oppose this measure again. Migrants will be abandoned, to be supported by their families. Circumstances can change. I am wondering exactly what the government will be doing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will probably be a great deal of difficulty proving circumstances of change. Many people might find difficulty getting around the system to do this. They will be supported by their families and communities, which places a bigger burden on families and extended families. It forces people to live together, which might not always be a good idea. It can lead to domestic violence in the home and crime in the streets. It can compound literacy and language fluency problems for migrants if they cannot get assistance to send their children to high school or university. If they have language problems, you are perhaps compounding the situation into the next generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that the whole policy of the current government in relation to migrant schemes is fairly venal. Basically it is talking about what industry can get and what kind of pressure industry can put on the workplace to make sure that, instead of training people properly for skilled positions, as soon as the price or demand for particular skills goes up they can bring people in. So it is a very narrow policy: `When people come to this country, let's get what we can out of them, let's rip out the money and let's somehow or other think that that equals a social policy.' I do not think it is good enough, I do not think this bill is good enough and we do not support it.</PARA>

Of course, the ethnic communities around Australia&mdash;and I speak in this debate not only as a Liberal senator but also as a migrant, myself, with contacts throughout the ethnic communities&mdash;rejected the Victor Rebikoff line.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Foreign Investment Review Board administers one of the most significant inputs to our economy. Accordingly, it is a report which must be understood by all members of parliament seeking to involve themselves in the debate about our economy. Foreign investment, the way in which we seek it and from where it comes are some of the most significant issues facing Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This being the case, I was pleased to draw from the report the acceptance by the board that investment was important and their willingness to work to ensure investment was encouraged. I was also pleased to read that investors were made aware of government policy by the review board and that it worked to ensure that investment fell within these policy frameworks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Four points stood out in this report. Firstly, I was happy to read in the report by the Foreign Investment Review Board that applications are dealt with quickly with the importance of investment paramount in their mind. In 1995-96, 82 per cent of applications were decided within 20 days upon receipt of completed application forms, and 94 per cent were completed within 30 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This processing time is an important point. If the bureaucracy becomes too time consum 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing and filled with red tape, incentive for companies to invest in Australia is reduced. Governments should always be aware that competition occurs not just between industries but also through access to markets. Government policy and administration can influence this access and administration greatly. An efficient application process is an advantage for Australia. The FIRB has an excellent record in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second pleasing aspect of the report is the areas in which foreign investment were encouraged. Importantly, the sector which accrued the highest investment proposal was manufactures. From approvals flowed $17.2 billion in proposed investment. I would be interested to learn from the board how much of this proposed investment has occurred, and when the remainder is due to occur, because those figures are not detailed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed investment in our manufacturing base is a clear indication of world trends in regard to manufacturing, a factor which Australia should not fight against. In the area of investment in Australia's commodity base, mining far exceeded that of the rural sector. Other significant growth areas were the service industries and tourism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third important factor stemming from the report regards those countries which are investing in Australia. The United States was Australia's major investor. Proposed investment from the US totalled 42 per cent of total applications to the review board. Importantly for Australia, Japanese investment increased in 1995-96 after several years of declining investment. Other significant proposals stem from Singapore, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth important point from the report relates to the flow of foreign investment. Contrary to some mythology, foreign investment in Australia is not a one-way street. Australian investment abroad is significant. Chart 3.1 on page 32 of the report shows Australian investment abroad overtaking that of foreign investment in Australia in 1993-94. While the situation has returned to foreign investment increasing above Australian investment abroad, the gap is still not yet substantial. The real test for Australia is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="614"> whether Australian companies investing abroad are reinvesting returns back to Australia and whether Australian companies have sufficient interest and incentive to invest in Australia and keep the returns here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Foreign investment in Australia is extremely important. As the report, in appendix A, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Capital from other countries supplements domestic savings and provides scope for higher rates of economic activity and development. Foreign direct investment also provides access to new technology, management skills and overseas markets.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report from the FIRB is a sound one. The policy of the government through 1995-96 resulted in increased investment in the right areas of manufactures. The first test over the next 12 months will be whether investment proposals increase again. This will depend on current government trade and industry policy. Importantly, in order for there to be high return for Australia, investment must be in the area of manufactures. The trend of past years must continue. We will monitor investment to see if this is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second test will be whether current government policies provide incentive and opportunities for Australian companies to invest in Australia. This too will depend on current Australian government industry policy.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have long taken an interest in reports from the Foreign Investment Review Board. I do not have the same optimistic view as Senator Bishop has just expressed. I do not oppose foreign investment, but I do wonder whether this government is actually putting in place some rules that mean that there is some net economic benefit to Australia as a result of foreign investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some interesting key points in this report. There were 4,536 applications considered: 4,005 of them were approved and, of those, 2,494 were with conditions&mdash;it is interesting that there has been a lot of comment about whether FIRB has sufficient staff to monitor compliance with conditions imposed&mdash;85 were rejected and 446 were withdrawn. Of the approved applications, $57.3 billion was approved and, of that, $13.8 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> billion was conditional. That was mostly in real estate. There was a huge jump in foreign investment in real estate in this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I made yesterday in question time was that, of the $57.3 billion, only $8.6 billion was for proposed new investment. The rest, $48.8 billion, was for the takeover of existing businesses. I want to raise that point again. How can this be in Australia's best economic interest when experience of the last decade particularly shows us that takeovers almost automatically lead to downsizing and job losses?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I want to make as an economic argument is that we are now seeing that profits paid to foreign investors have more than doubled, to $12.4 billion, during the past three years and now constitutes 60 per cent of the current account deficit. I made the point yesterday, and I make it again today: we make a big deal about foreign debt in this country. We had the debt truck which lost its wheels. That debt truck should have had a great big 60 per cent chunk for profits paid to foreigners because, while with reasonable economic management we might eventually pay off debt, we will do nothing about this component of our current account unless we have a policy change&mdash;and that is in the hands of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that matter, I notice that the WTO is pushing for global foreign investment rules. An article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 18 October said that the World Trade Organisation had embarked on a concerted campaign to introduce global rules to govern foreign investment practices. Here we go again. We have had GATT and now we have the WTO turning their attention to foreign investment. In this country we have a policy which has some screening. The Liberal Party, in its pre-election statements, made certain commitments to some screening of foreign investment in key sectors. I want to return to that if I have time. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article also said that any move by the international community to establish new foreign investment rules could significantly weaken the powers of Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board. The report confirmed for us that Treasury is revising foreign investment 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="615"> policy under the negotiations of the OECD multilateral investment treaty, under the APEC individual action plan and the competition principles agreement regulation review. So out there in Treasury there is a huge rethink going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While they are rethinking, I just want to go back to the coalition's recommendations to the Senate select committee, when we looked a couple of years ago in 1994 at how FIRB operated. The recommendations were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.2  That the government incorporate all components of its foreign investment policy into a single statute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.3<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">  That the legislation include a comprehensive statement of the goals of foreign investment policy and identify those sectors of the economy which should be subject to foreign investment regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.4  That the legislation contain the criteria which should be used to determine applications by foreign investors and that it should also provide, where appropriate, that the interests of domestic bidders be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is a lot more. I am just wondering how a coalition government is going to marry what they said in 1994 and what Mr Costello said on the record just prior to the last election with what the WTO is now asking of us as a global citizen. I look forward to the coalition's policy announcements.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with a great deal of what Senator Kernot said in relation to this report. The Foreign Investment Review Board is and has been for some time somewhat of a toothless tiger. We do still have some investment criteria. Basically I think it is the role of any country to say, `If people want to buy part of the country's productive capacity there should be some sort of criteria under which they do that.' As Senator Kernot has indicated, there is a lot of pressure on Australia to drop the remaining criteria.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right&mdash;what the Treasurer says it is. In September 1987, the $600,000 examination threshold was abolished. In April 1993 the government decided to increase the maximum permitted foreign investment interest involvement in mass circulation of newspapers by a single shareholder to 25 per cent. In September 1995, the Treasurer announced that the limit on foreign investment of provincial and suburban newspapers would be increased to 30 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There used to be a couple of areas which were sacrosanct in terms of some level of control&mdash;they were media and telecommunications. We know what has happened to them. There is very little in relation to domestic real estate. Why should this concern Senator Kernot and me in relation to domestic real estate? Because it is an issue of benefits and welfare. What is the actual benefit to Australia of people speculating in real estate? I would say: very little. If you are a person who is trying to make money out of buying and selling real estate, maybe there is benefit. But the family home is usually the biggest single investment the average person trying to live makes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If what you have is the desire to make investment figures look good by a high level of speculative investment in real estate, that is what we seem to be getting to. The figures in this report probably bear very little reflection to what is going on. I am not sure how 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="616"> many people there are actually working for the Foreign Investment Review Board these days but I am sure they do not have the numbers to check how many people do report. It is very narrow list of types of investment which need to be reported these days, and I am sure they simply do not have the people to check on every real estate investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really do think there is a point where we have to talk in our country about what are the outcomes we would like to see from trade and investment policy. I think we have been pushed around a lot. I think we have been very naive in relation to our negotiations with GATT and the World Trade Organisation and I think the outcomes in relation to the Foreign Investment Review Board reflect that. But there are a pressures now to get rid of what is left. We should stand up and say that we have the right to make decisions about benefits to Australian trade and investment and we should demand to keep that right to make those decisions about whether investment is of benefit to Australia or not.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish this evening to talk about my recent experience in the Antarctic and put a number of things on the public record. At the beginning of December last year I, with two other federal colleagues&mdash;one from this House and one from the House of Representatives&mdash;and two state members of parliament had the privilege, and I must say that is `privilege' in capital letters, of joining the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aurora Australis</EMPHASIS>  on the ANARE trip to all the Australian bases. We went to Mawson and Davis. While at Davis we went to the Chinese base Zhong Shan, then on to the Russian base Mirny, to Casey and then on to Macquarie Island.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think I have come back a little different. I was told by others who have been on this trip that I would come back changed and I am sure that is the case. It was invigorating. It was a wonderful experience. It was awe&hyphen;inspiring. It was thought provoking. It was, I think, soul restoring. Much of what happens in this place is sometimes soul destroying and we do not often have opportunities to have soul restoring experiences; this was a soul restoring experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To see the majesty of the sea, the ice, the icebergs, the icecap, the ice plateau, and the beauty of the animals&mdash;the Antarctic birds, the seals, the penguins&mdash;and to see how those animals can survive in very hostile conditions was an experience for which I am very grateful. I am very grateful to the people of Victoria that I was elected to the Senate so that I had that opportunity. There are lots of things you do in this job that you wished you were not doing, but this was a great excitement and a great privilege.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But with all privileges come responsibilities, and one of the roles that we played in going down there was to look at Australia's involvement in the Antarctic program. We had to evaluate our performance of what we are doing down there and to make suggestions, as the Antarctic division has a foresight project&mdash;a project which looks at its program for the coming years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe we need to ensure that we do not get so caught up in maintaining and developing the infrastructure that we lose sight of the real reason for our presence in the Antarctic, and one reason for our presence is to undertake research. There is a great deal of research being undertaken there. There is an enormous amount of meteorological data being gathered. That data has an immediate use in predicting weather in Australia but it also has a long-term use. We have research going on that is looking at global warming. There are astrophysicists working there looking at the upper atmosphere. There are lots of biological projects looking at aspects of the wildlife.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, they are looking at penguins and their response to humans. They are looking at penguins and their distribution and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="617"> whether they would be affected by possible changes in the availability of their food source. Penguins are high up in the food chain, and any change to them will give an indication of what is happening, especially in the oceans. They are looking at research on the Antarctic birds and the seals as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also some fascinating research being done in cooperation with a university in England. Students from Nottingham University are working on one of our bases, looking at anti-freeze proteins in bacteria. That has implications for the preservation of food, because there is a problem with food forming crystals when it is frozen. This research may be able to be used. It also has implications for medicine in terms of organ transplants and preserving organs and preserving parts of bodies that might happen to be severed in accidents&mdash;for example, industrial accidents&mdash;until they can be reattached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is a wide range of research, and I was quite surprised at some of the research. Research is also being done on the expeditioners who go down there. They are looking at their immune systems and other aspects of their health. They are looking at the effects of isolation and extreme cold, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So an enormous amount of research is being done, but I think we need to make sure that we get that balance right. That is one of the messages that I brought home from that experience. We need to get the balance between ensuring that we have people there in comfort and in safety and also that we do not end up having that dominate so that we lose sight of one of the real reasons for being there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to speak tonight about something that I think we all, as Australians, ought to know about, and that is the cooperation that is occurring between nations in the Antarctic. I said in my interview on Christmas Day with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Radio Australia</EMPHASIS> that one of the lessons you learn is that down there, when you are isolated in the freezing cold, you rely on other people and on other nations. It is because of that isolation and the risk and the danger that people are forced together. They have to actually do things and work together. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It seemed to me that it was a message in that we are a planet and our environment is at risk in a number of ways. It seemed that if we could learn the lesson from the cooperation we see in the Antarctic, it is a great lesson for nations as a whole. So it is a tremendous example of the way in which countries can cooperate when they have to. They have to down there because they are forced to do so by necessity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example of this cooperation would be when we delivered some fuel to the Russian base. They had a problem with their resupply, and we agreed to deliver fuel, for which they paid. I have to pay a compliment here to the way in which there was cooperation between the full&hyphen;time ANARE staff; the meteorological bureau staff; the expeditioners, who were virtually temporary staff with ANARE; those who were round tripping; those who were going just for the summer; and those expeditioners who were there for the winter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between those private enterprise people who were there manning the helicopters, the helicopter pilots and the helicopter engineers, the members of the various maritime unions and the politicians, there was this enormous sense of cooperation. We had a goal: we had to get in, get the changeovers done and get out. We saw the helicopter pilots shifting food. We saw the pollies moving food. We saw various people helping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we got to Mawson and we were doing the changeover, we encountered a blizzard. We saw the members of the various maritime unions&mdash;and that includes the engineers, the ratings and people like that, because they belong to different unions&mdash;working together. We saw the captain, the engineers and the ratings working in cooperation with the full&hyphen;time ANARE staff, the meteorological bureau people and the expeditioners. When you saw the union members using the cranes to put crates and large containers onto the barges, which were being manned by ANARE staff, and when you saw the cooperation between union and non-union people working in extreme conditions&mdash;when we looked out from the bridge, we could see that the snow was coming in horizontally&mdash;you had to say there was a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="618"> lesson in that for all Australians as well. There was a lesson in that when there was something to be achieved, when there was a goal, they were all committed to that goal, and they could work together in a cooperative and sensible way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw that, for example, at Mirny when we came in to deliver the fuel. The Russians wanted to knock off at 4 o'clock, because that is the time they knock off. Our guys&mdash;our `polarmen', as we jokingly called them&mdash;said, `No, we want to continue.' They hooked up the line and we finished refuelling by 3 o'clock in the morning and were able to leave at about 3.10 a.m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish the Senate would give me an extension so I can actually name the people who are on the crew, because I think they do not often get named. Perhaps I can do that in the last minute of my speech. I congratulate Captain Tim Archer; the ice pilot, Gustav Henriksen; the officers, Murray Doyle, Scott Laughlin and Cameron Harris; the engineers, David Crane, Doug Haig, Julian Grant and Robert Cave; the cooks, Paul Brown, Bill Robinson and Colin Murray&mdash;and let me say a ship does travel on its stomach, and they were fantastic; the stewards, Frank Soutter, Sue Pickering, Terry Reid and Lee Hardman; the IRs, Per Larsen, Big Al Hornsby, Elvis Harcombe, Phil Hayes, Cole Pritchard, Gov Curphey, George Jhugaroo and Richard Perry; and the TIRs, the trainees, Brent Stewart and Ron Dalrymple. I must say to them, well done for an example they set on how we can achieve things when there is cooperation.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="618"><TITLE>Charleville</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a hard act to follow this evening, I think. I wish to speak about the town of Charleville in western Queensland. Charleville is a town rich in the history of that western area and, of course, it has been beset by floods in recent times, most recently within the last week or so and before that in 1990. On both occasions the floods were quite devastating to the town, although on the last occasion not as much. The floods in themselves did attract a great deal of government and community support for the people in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Charleville, and that was very gratefully received.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue I specifically want to address this evening is another problem that has beset the people of Charleville, and that is that on the night of 12 January this year the Western Exports Pty Ltd abattoir burnt down. This might not appear to be a grave problem in many communities, but in the community of Charleville it was quite a grave problem indeed. I quote from the Toowoomba <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chronicle</EMPHASIS> of 13 January:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This $6.5 million plant, owned and operated by Western Exports Pty Ltd, was officially opened in late October by Queensland Premier Mr Rob Borbidge.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It was a major employer for the region, so much so that, again quoting from the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chronicle</EMPHASIS>  of 13 January:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December the workforce was around 65, all of whom were recruited in the Charleville area.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">With employment being a problem in the rural communities, here we had an industry that had started up, an abattoir, which was employing a substantial number of people and was later described as being a major employer in that area, suffering a major disaster on the night of 12 January.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Immediately I heard about this I called upon the federal government and the state government to look at the situation in Charleville to make sure of the needs of the people and to see if they could intervene to accommodate the employment needs of the people in that area. Interestingly enough, in the Toowoomba <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chronicle</EMPHASIS> of 14 January the state government in Queensland, through the local member, Mr Howard Hobbs, made this statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Member for Warrego and Minister for Natural Resources Mr Howard Hobbs said the fire would have a devastating effect on the local community as the meat processing plant was one of the town's biggest employers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further interest was shown by the Queensland state government through the rural communities minister, Mrs Di McCauley. In the Toowoomba <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chronicle</EMPHASIS>  of Friday, 17 January she said: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="619">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm told that some 60 people will be stood down for between six and eight months while the works are re&hyphen;built.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further on in that same article she is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The people of Charleville have hardly had an easy time in the past seven or eight years. But the town has tremendous community spirit and will overcome this latest hurdle.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I believe that the country people, as resilient as they are, would like to have thought that after a fire there would not have been a flood. I think what was really needed in the instance of Charleville was some government intervention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Toowoomba <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chronicle</EMPHASIS> had a great interest in this particular fire, because in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chronicle</EMPHASIS> of Monday, 20 January the impact of that fire on the local economy starts to emerge. The article of 20 January states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its destruction&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the destruction of the meatworks&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">devastated the region, throwing 65 people out of work for at least 10 months and depriving the local economy of an estimated $25,000 a week in wages.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In many other communities, that might not have a major effect, but in a rural area such as Charleville it has a profound effect indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was exacerbated by the floods that came not more than three to four weeks after that. There is a real problem in Charleville and the call that I made on 13 January seeking intervention by both state and federal governments is not without some merit in this particular set of circumstances, because the loss of jobs in that particular community will have a severe impact on the rural community itself. When those jobs are lost, as has been seen from the articles, for up to six to eight months, they are not easily replaced and it means that there is a crisis emerging within the community itself. There are no other major employers within that community who would be able to absorb those temporarily unemployed, and I believe governments, both state and federal, have a responsibility to look at the Charleville case in isolation as a special case and something which is owed to the rural people in Australia and in particular of Queensland. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the unforeseen consequences of the fire was that, as a result of the changes made by the government to the social security legislation, some young people suffered. I do not know whether this consequence was foreseen, but the particular concern was raised by a person who is under the age of 18, who was told that he was ineligible to receive any form of social security until he turned 18 or left home. This was a young person who went out, got a job in the meatworks and was prepared to stay at the meatworks and who, for no reason other than fate, found himself unemployed. He was a taxpayer whilst he was at the abattoir and, because he believed he had ongoing employment and some security, he took out a hire purchase agreement for a car. As I have said, through no fault of his own, he lost his job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sad part was that, because of the changes the government had made previously, there was no safety net to pick him up other than to place an obligation upon his parents. I think that is basically and fundamentally wrong. It is patently unjust to place this person in that position when he had been a taxpayer. That person should at least have had the opportunity to pick up the appropriate unemployment benefits when, through no fault of his own, he had been placed on the unemployment list. Of course, there is no real prospect of that young person retrieving his job for at least another eight to 10 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will happen, in the intervening period, to the undertakings that that person has made on the purchase of his car? There are only two things that can happen: either the parents of that person will bail him out&mdash;and I am not sure that the circumstances of the parents of that particular young person will enable that to happen; or he will lose his car.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, whilst this is not a major case in its own right, the fact that 65 people did lose their jobs and the fact that $25,000 a week has gone out of the local economy in the Charleville area, mean that rural Queenslanders deserve a better deal. They deserve some special intervention on the part of both the state and the federal governments in this particular case. Whilst the state government has made some noises, nothing has really 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="620"> been done, and I would like to think that the federal government will see its way to doing something for the people of Charleville.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="620"><TITLE>Mobile Phones</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise again to speak tonight on the subject of electromagnetic radiation and its possible health effects. I am prompted to raise this matter again because of a number of recent events of which I believe the Senate should be aware. Just two weeks ago, Telstra ran a very large advertisement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> &mdash;and, I presume, in other daily newspapers&mdash;featuring a young girl in a school uniform, holding a mobile phone to her ear and announcing to her mother that she had made it into the team. The ad stressed the importance of keeping in touch. On 17 January, Telstra also featured in their magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our future</EMPHASIS> , on page 2, a girl of just eight years of age who had won a design competition, and she was shown clutching a mobile phone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not single out Telstra as being the only one to attempt to increase their market share by targeting children. No doubt other carriers will jump on this bandwagon if it proves to be profitable, if they have not already done so. But as a former teacher, I can imagine some problems which might arise for schools if large populations of children suddenly begin taking mobile phones with them to school. However, my main concern here is in relation to risks to health which parents might unwittingly be exposing their children to by providing them with this technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard, here and in other places, people scoff at the idea that there might be health risks associated with telecommunications equipment, and I have heard people who are concerned about this matter categorised as the lunatic fringe. Of course, the telecommunications industry, with so much to lose from evidence which might establish any such link, is also keen to marginalise views of this sort, and to see that those in government do not look too closely at the growing body of scientific evidence which ought to at least make us cautious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So my aim this evening is to acquaint senators with some of the scientific work 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which has been done, which points very clearly to the danger associated with mobile phone use by children. I want to begin with a paper by Dr Ivan Beale from the University of Auckland, published in 1993 entitled, `Biological effects of weak radiofrequency radiation'. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our current safety standards are based only on research showing adverse effects of body tissue heating in animals exposed for brief periods to relatively high radiation levels.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He says that there are no research studies of the long&hyphen;term animal or human exposures to the complex type of radiation emitted from, for instance, mobile phone towers. For this reason, he questions the legitimacy of the existing exposure standards. He says that, whilst exposure of the general public to radiation levels of more than a few microwatts per square centimetre is rare, even that amount is millions of times higher than the levels of radiofrequency radiation arising from natural sources. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given their circumstances and considering also the lack of relevant research studies and the limited applicability of current exposure standards, a responsible course of action is to minimise unnecessary exposure . . . prudent avoidance is now being widely applied for addressing the uncertainties regarding health risks from non&hyphen;ionizing radiation. Its application is particularly appropriate in situations involving exposure of more vulnerable sections of the public, such as children, who may be particularly prone to effects of exposure and may have limited ability to protect themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The operation of cell sites (mobile phone towers) on or near kindergartens or school properties is likely to result in large increases in radiofrequency exposure for groups of children. This is contrary to the principle of prudent avoidance and inconsistent with good health protection policy.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Dr Beale forms this view in the light of thousands of studies of biological effects of radiofrequency/microwave radiation. He says that this area of research is developing rapidly, but it is generally accepted that there is much more to learn than we already know. I think this is a very important point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry argue that research has been done and has not proved that electromagnetic radiation emitted by their equipment is a significant health risk. Some would say that the onus of proof should be upon the industry 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="621"> to prove that their equipment is safe. However, what is clear is that we are dealing with a very complex number of fields of science and that no one study could ever be expected to prove the case either for or against. Like the case against tobacco, a body of research on electromagnetic radiation will need to be built up, probably over a very long period of time, before we can establish a high level of probability or otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Biological studies of enzymes and human cells exposed in vitro to radiofrequency/microwave fields have shown a number of effects which cannot be explained simply by the heating effects of radiation on which our current standards are based. These include changes in cell membrane permeability to potassium, sodium and calcium; changes in the composition or behaviour of blood&hyphen;forming and immunological cells; alteration of calcium ion exchange in nerve tissue; changes in the firing patterns of neurones; and changes in levels of cancer related enzymes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In spite of the fact that there are some 60 million mobile phone users worldwide in what could well be described as an experiment of mammoth proportions, there have been&mdash;for quite obvious reasons, I suppose&mdash;very few studies of controlled exposure of human volunteers. Some studies have shown a warmth and pain phenomenon in which the frequency pulses are experienced as clicks, buzzes or chirps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a number of surveys and reports of accidental exposure to radiation above recommended safety limits. The reported effects include severe anxiety, hypertension, headaches, nausea and fatigue. In one case a pilot inadvertently stood for five minutes in front of an air fighter radar antenna and in addition to physical symptoms such as oedema and necrosis of the neck muscles, he experienced memory loss and extreme sleepiness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also numerous epidemiological studies of people who are known to have been exposed to higher than background levels of radiation. There are obvious difficulties in locating control groups with epidemiological studies, however, Dr Bruce Hocking's study of TV transmitter towers in Sydney which 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> found a higher incidence of childhood leukaemia in the area is a case in point. If Australia were to adopt the principle of prudent avoidance, then this study would lead us to do what New Zealand has done and avoid locating mobile phone towers adjacent to schools and kindergartens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) made a speech late last year when Dr Hocking's study was published. He dismissed this study somewhat by saying it probably represented a cancer cluster. I am informed that a careful re&hyphen;examination of Dr Hocking's paper would show that the increased incidence of acute leukemia in children was uniform across the suburbs proximate to the towers. This is a very strong argument against such a cluster effect. I think we have here yet again an example of a head in the sand approach by government and perhaps a propping up of that industry line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other epidemiological studies have shown that chronic exposure may increase the incidence of physical symptoms such as heart disease, cancer, birth abnormalities, pregnancy miscarriage, memory problems and lens opacities, otherwise known as cataracts. Dr Neil Cherry from New Zealand in his paper entitled `Potential and actual adverse effects of cellsite microwave radiation' said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . dozens of epidemiological studies of large populations and large numbers of workers occupationally exposed to radiofrequency/microwave radiation show statistically significant increases of a wide spectrum of cancers, and there can be little or no doubt that chronic low level exposure to radiofrequency microwave radiation produces increased cancer risk.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A recent study in Belgium found that very close range exposure to microwaves from a cellular phone base station increased the effect of a chemical mutagen on human blood cells, leading to increased chromosomal aberrations. The assistant director of a Kuwaiti cancer centre a few days ago warned that mobile telephones can cause headaches, memory loss and chronic ear inflammation. He advised against using cellular phones except in emergency cases and for not more than 30 minutes at a time.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent times, the Australian Democrats have embarked upon a youth poll in which at question No. 17 they ask the youth who are polled whether or not they have partaken of certain substances&mdash;namely, amphetamines&mdash;such as LSD. In launching the youth poll, the Democrat senator involved was asked how she would answer that question. We got a very cutsie sort of answer according to media reports. The senator, we are told, diplomatically declined to answer the question, `Have you ever tried amphetamines?' She told 13 that she did not want to upset her mother with the answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think you need much of an imagination to understand what that answer actually meant. Could you imagine the mother referred to breaking down sobbing uncontrollably because the senator confessed to not having tried LSD and other drugs?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to respond this evening because, unlike Senator Abetz, I would like to take time to prepare some research on this issue, such as presenting to the chamber a New South Wales Young Liberals survey of young people's attitudes on issues affecting them in which I think he might find similar issues and questions raised about drug abuse. But Senator Abetz, I will stand by youth poll, as I have for six years, as being the only survey conducted by a national political party into the views of young Australians 15 to 25 years of age&mdash;and this year of those aged 15 to 20 years. There is six years worth of research that has gone into those polls; six years where we have assessed everything from drug taking, sure, right through to young people's opinions on what substances should be legal, illegal and decriminalised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From youth poll you will find, quite hearteningly, I am sure, that young people are very

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will respond in more detail because I think reading that particular article tonight was beneath Senator Abetz. I find his comments mischievous. I believe that if he really cared about young people in this country, let alone the specific problem of young people and drug taking, he would have approached this matter from a very different perspective. And that would have been without the usual stereotypic and negative baggage that is applied to young Australians and without using me&mdash;admittedly, not until the end of his speech did he use my name&mdash;as an example of sending the wrong messages when I conclude that it is only the Australian Democrats that are sending the right messages to young people in this country: that they are worthy, that their self-esteem should be assisted and increased and that, if they have drug problems, perhaps we should treat that as the health and social and destructive issue it is as opposed to the legal, moralistic and conservative issue that some people in this place would prefer to treat it as.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="7.46 p.m." PAGE="623"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 7.46 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I thank the honourable senator for her question. I realise that there has been a considerable delay since the question was asked, and I apologise for not responding earlier. However; during the latter half of 1996, the Government was intensively involved in developing a major package of changes to laws governing carrier network rollout activities. These changes are designed to address community concerns on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Following consultation with interested parties, including State and Territory governments, the Government announced in December 1996 the regulatory regime for carriers powers and immunities. The approach is that State and Territory planning and environment laws will generally apply to the rollout of telecommunications infrastructure from July 1997 with limited exceptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are three limited exceptions to this general rule. First, there will be some standing exemptions for inspection of land, maintenance of facilities, installation of low impact facilities, and temporary

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator Parer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(a) The scientific basis used by AFMA to implement an ecological and precautionary approach has been implemented through the development of a rigorous process of ecological, environmental, stock assessment and economic advice to the AFMA Board through Management Advisory Committees (which in turn generally have research subcommittees), Fisheries Assessment Groups and the AFMA Research and Environment Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">AFMA has direct control over only very limited research funds for the investigation of scientific issues such as stock assessment and ecological interactions. Considerable effort has also been put into influencing research fund providers (e.g. the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation) to obtain sufficient funding for high priority Commonwealth fisheries research that is not already paid for by industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time, it has been recognised that there is a need to obtain greater certainty in scientific advice on stock assessments, and AFMA has encouraged peer review of scientific assessments by either external international experts or some of the leading Australian scientific community (many of whom are also internationally regarded as leaders in their field of fisheries assessment expertise). Where fisheries are linked to international bodies (such as the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources&mdash;CCAMLR) AFMA also utilises information and results from these bodies to introduce ecologically sustainable management arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fishery Assessment Groups are specifically set up for each of AFMA's major fisheries to provide stock assessment information, and recommend research programs. These groups include stock assessment experts, external fisheries consultants, economists, industry representatives, fishery managers and invited observers from various NGOs and conservation organisations. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="627">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) There is a significant body of data required to support the scientific approach being taken in the management of fisheries. The data required varies from fishery to fishery depending on the species being managed, the method of fishing and the method of fishery assessment. The data required include life history information, fishing catch and effort, areas of occurrence, biological samples, length frequency information, tagging data on fish caught, tagged and then released, data on fishing conditions (e.g. sea temperature), data on observed operations and any interactions that these operations may have on species such as seabirds or mammals; benthic samples, daily logbook information and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Data collection is an extensive part of the research program in any fishery. However, stock assessment and environmental impact assessment must be undertaken with a less-than-perfect knowledge of precisely what is occurring and can only be based on the best information available at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) TACs for fisheries are set through a process which involves several steps. These steps may vary from fishery to fishery, but in general the following process is adopted:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Advice is received from the Fishery Assessment Group which has undertaken modelling work to assess the status of the fishery. The modelling process adopted depends on the fishery. Factors influencing the methodology utilised for stock assessment, and therefore ultimately TAC setting, include the species under consideration, the fishing method/s utilised, the area of fishing, the quantity, resolution and reliability of fishery dependent data, the availability of fishery independent data, and the availability of ageing and length frequency data. Methods used may include Virtual Population Analysis, Delay-Difference models, age-structured population modelling, surplus production models, stock reduction models as well as numerous other methods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. This advice is considered by the Management Advisory Committee for the fishery and/or its sub-committees who review the range of the catch limits recommended by the Fishery Assessment Group together with other relevant information against the objectives and biological reference points for the fishery and make a recommendation to the AFMA Board of an appropriate TAC for the fishery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AFMA Board considers the advice of the Fishery Assessment Group and the Management Advisory Committee together with the views of AFMA management and any other relevant groups (such as the Sub-Antarctic Ecological Assessment group in the case of the Macquarie Island Developmental Fishery) and sets the TAC. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a) Macquarie Island</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ecological Approach</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To manage the Macquarie Island Developmental Fishery on a sound ecological basis, AFMA established two expertise-based groups, the Macquarie Island Developmental Fishery Stock Assessment Group (MacSAG) and the Sub-Antarctic Ecological Assessment Group (SEAG).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">MacSAG was made up of participants from a range of relevant research and management organisations, independent fisheries stock assessment consultants and the commercial operator with previous experience in the fishery and provided the AFMA Board with stock assessment advice on the status of the Patagonian Toothfish stocks around Macquarie Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">SEAG provided advice on a number of environmental issues relevant to the fishery, including advice regarding methods of minimising potentially adverse ecological impacts of commercial fishing around Macquarie Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advice of both of these groups has formed the basis of the Macquarie Island Developmental Fishing Policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specific actions taken by AFMA to manage the fishery on an ecological basis are included in the policy in the form of restrictions on and mandatory requirements of the licensed commercial operator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commercial fishing in the waters around Macquarie Island is restricted to the methods of demersal and pelagic trawling. Given the current endangered status of the Macquarie Island wandering albatross population, and the extensive seabird populations that breed on the island, exploratory longline fishing is not currently permitted in the Macquarie Island AFZ.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A minimum mesh size of 120 mm applies for Patagonian Toothfish, and a minimum bobbin diameter of 52 cm will apply unless, as part of the research into the environmental impacts of trawling, there is a need to monitor the effects of different bobbin sizes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commercial operator is required to take all reasonable steps to minimise the potential collision and mortality of seabirds with the vessel. Lighting on board the vessel is to be kept to the minimum, particularly at those times when the likelihood of seabirds colliding with the vessel are considered to be high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The policy states that a requirement of no offal discharge will be trialled during the 1996/97 fishing season. However, if this is not possible (for example, due to mechanical breakdown), contingency arrangements will be developed between the commercial operator and AFMA, based on advice from the relevant working groups with the aim of ensuring that no offal is made available to seabirds. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="628"> Also, no poultry products (including egg shells) or brassicas (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, kale, etc.) are to be discharged from the fishing vessel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Carriage of two observers approved by AFMA is mandatory for the 1996/97 season, to ensure that appropriate fisheries data, samples and environmental data are collected from each trip.

The final policy was approved following a determination in accordance with the Administrative Procedures under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, that neither an environmental impact statement nor a public environment report was required and that AFMA's assessment process had identified the relevant environmental issues and measures needed for the protection of the environment.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Interim Management Policy for the Heard Island and McDonald Island Exploratory Fishery has yet to be finalised. The following reflects the contents of the draft policy as circulated to a broad range of interested parties in November 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ecological Approach</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ecological approach taken by AFMA in managing the exploratory fishery in AFZ waters around Heard and McDonald Island is similar to that taken for Macquarie Island, however some additional data summaries (less detailed than required by AFMA) will be compiled to ensure that Australia meets its CCAMLR data obligations for this area which forms part of CCAMLR sub-area 58.5.2.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">AFMA is aware that Australia's two sub-Antarctic fisheries have different characteristics, however the two fisheries are based on the same

They also have similar environmental issues, so much so that when SEAG formulated its advice for Macquarie Island they specifically noted that it also applied to Heard Island and McDonald Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scientific permits issued by AFMA will not allow any fishing within twelve nautical miles of Heard and McDonald Islands. The Islands themselves and surrounding territorial waters out to 12 nautical miles form the Heard Island Wilderness Reserve, which is managed by the Australian Antarctic Division, under a formal Management Plan established under the Heard and McDonald Islands Environment Protection and Management Ordinance 1987. The Management Plan, which was established in September 1995, prohibits commercial fishing within the 12 nautical mile territorial waters around the Islands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commercial operators will be required to take all reasonable steps to minimise the potential collision and mortality of seabirds with their vessels. Lighting on board vessels is to be kept to the minimum, particularly at those times when the likelihood of seabirds colliding with a vessel are considered to be high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The policy states that a requirement for no offal discharge will be trialled during the 1996/97 fishing season. However, if this is not possible (for example, due to mechanical breakdown), contingency arrangements will be developed between the commercial operator and AFMA, based on advice from the relevant working groups with the aim of ensuring that no offal is made available to seabirds. Also, no poultry products (including egg shells) or brassicas (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, kale, etc.) are to be discharged from any fishing vessel.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Precautionary Approach</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed that the Heard Island and McDonald Island Exploratory Fishery will involve exploratory fishing carried out under Scientific Permits granted by AFMA in respect of a maximum of three commercial fishing vessels. The exploratory fishing to be undertaken during 1996/97 will seek to provide initial information on the potential environmental impacts and commercial viability of any longer term fishery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the terms of the Interim Management Policy for the Heard Island and McDonald Island Exploratory Fishery, which AFMA is currently in the process of finalising, the fishery will be managed in accordance with the CCAMLR `ecosystem approach'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">TACs for Patagonian Toothfish, ice fish and other species for the statistical sub-area 58.5.2 have been set by CCAMLR, after considering advice from prominent stock assessment experts from a large number of CCAMLR countries. These experts come together as a Fish Stock Assessment Working Group to consider all the available information and provide advice to CCAMLR's Scientific Committee. The Scientific Committee considers this advice and then provides advice to CCAMLR, recommending precautionary catch limits which take into account the needs of predators and other elements of the ecosystem, as well as other management measures which should be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) played a key role in developing the technical stock assessment and management advice to CCAMLR for the Heard and McDonald Islands region, drawing upon approximately three years of research work which AAD had undertaken in the area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In developing the Interim Management Policy for the Heard Island and McDonald Island Exploratory Fishery, AFMA has relied on the CCAMLR network and final outcome of CCAMLR's decision in providing the best available advice on appropriate precautionary catch limits for the area which includes the AFZ around Heard and McDonald Islands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">CCAMLR has set TACs for sub-area 58.5.2 at 3,800 tonnes for Patagonian Toothfish, 311 tonnes for ice fish and 50 tonnes each for any other deep water species.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) During the previous fishing expedition (1995/96) conducted around Macquarie Island a total of 970 tonnes of Patagonian Toothfish was caught by the vessel Austral Leader.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Macquarie Island Stock Assessment Group (MacSAG) recommended to AFMA a scientific assessment, that a catch of approximately 1000 tonnes per year, taken of juvenile fish for a period of 2-3 years, was not likely to cause long term harm to the Toothfish stock. This would allow further fishery development activity while the necessary research information was collected to refine the TAC estimation.

Basically, unless the take is knowing or reckless, it is not illegal. In this context, `take' includes `kill, destroy, damage or collect'.

Please note, however, that these estimates were prepared early in this calendar year before AFMA was aware of the recent substantial increase in the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) of Patagonian toothfish for the area surrounding Heard and McDonald Islands (the TAC for the area was increased from 297 tonnes to 3,800 tonnes at the 1996 meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Living Marine Resources). AFMA is currently finalising arrangements for fishing around Heard and McDonald Islands, and it is estimated that an additional cost of $202,000 will be incurred in providing observer coverage for the three vessels which AFMA anticipates will be operating in the area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife advised AFMA in May 1996 that a section of netting (11m x 6m) had been washed ashore on Macquarie Island. This loss had not been reported by the Austral Leader. When the vessel's operator, Austral Fisheries Pty Ltd, was advised of the find, it offered to pay for the retrieval of the net and its transport to Hobart, so that it could be identified and traced to its source if possible. After being supplied with samples of the net, the company conceded that it was of the same type as that used on the Austral Leader and could conceivably have come from the vessel. The matter was also referred to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) for investigation. After investigation, and consultation with AAD, AMSA was satisfied with the action that had been taken by Austral Fisheries to prevent net losses and has decided not to take any further action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second incident occurred on the Austral Leader's current fishing trip to Macquarie Island. On 4 January 1997 the vessel lost four yellow plastic floats with a diameter of 14 inches. The loss of gear was reported to AFMA on 6 January 1997 as part of the regular weekly report. This information was passed on to the Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service, in case the floats should wash up on the island. Preliminary advice of the loss has been passed to AMSA. AFMA will seek further advice from the observers on board the vessel on its return to port.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Australian Antarctic Division has advised that three lots of netting have recently been discovered on Macquarie Island, by Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition personnel conducting their monthly survey of beach debris on the island. The netting is a mixture of both cargo and fishing nets. The Australian Antarctic Division did not advise of any evidence which might suggest that some or all of this netting might have originated from the Austral Leader or, for that matter, from any other Australian vessel.</PARA>
