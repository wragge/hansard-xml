<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer to Senator Boswell's dispute with the Prime Minister in regard to his claim that Mr Howard's 10&hyphen;point plan failed to deliver on promises made to the Nationals and his challenge to Mr Howard to produce the notes of his meeting with the Federal President of the National Party, Mr McDonald. I ask: did Mr Howard deliver on the promises made to the Nationals and, if so, why do the Nationals insist that he did not? Will the notes of the meeting be released so that we can tell whether it is the Prime Minister or Senator Boswell who is telling the truth?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I can tell Senator Faulkner is that the coalition government is working constructively towards a fair and just response to the Wik case. We had a very constructive party meeting today on that matter, in which the Prime Minister's 10&hyphen;point plan was very firmly and overwhelmingly endorsed. I think that is a good sign for the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that many in the community have felt the strain post&hyphen;Wik, particularly pastoral leaseholders. We have talked about that in this place before. They were basically misled by the previous Labor government. When they found that the law was not what they had been assured of by the previous government, they naturally felt somewhat distressed by that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has answered that challenge; in particular, by the Prime Minister working through the alternatives with great care with all the major stakeholder groups. The response that he has developed is, as I said, fair and equitable.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Mr Howard delivered on his promises made to the Nationals and, if he did so, why they insisted he did not.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am trying to explain to Senator Faulkner that he is suffering from a fundamental misunderstanding. I am trying to explain to him that this very difficult issue has been constructively worked through between the Prime Minister, all stakeholders and the parties of our coalition, including the National Party. As I said to Senator Faulkner, the proposals of the Prime Minister, a fair and just package, have been overwhelmingly endorsed by the coalition party room today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Faulkner should be doing is applauding the way in which the Prime Minister has acted in this very complex and difficult matter. It was not his fault that he inherited the consequences of Labor misleading the Australian people and he has made a great effort, as I said, to find a response that is fair and equitable, in the interest of all Australians. That response will go through further processes now&mdash;the development of legislation and an exposure draft. It will ultimately be brought to this place and I hope will then be overwhelmingly endorsed by all senators in this place because it is in the national interests.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Senator Hill might ask himself why I would applaud when the National Party, as part of his own coalition government, are in open revolt. Senator Hill, if you are not willing to comment on whether Mr Howard delivered on the promises he made to the National Party, perhaps you could explain to the Senate why Mr Fischer wrote to Mr McDonald after the cabinet meeting on 7 May claiming that cabinet had agreed to include the Nationals' amendments in the 10&hyphen;point plan?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam President, and thank you, Senator Chapman, for the question that you have asked.

It is true that Labor left office with Australia facing substantial economic and fiscal problems, the most obvious of which&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And we are not blaming you for that, Senator, as you were not here, but we blame all these failed ministers on the front bench. Labor left office with a $10 billion underlying budget deficit. In fact, in their last five years in office Labor racked up deficits of some $70 billion in total. Under Labor, of course, Australia suffered the worst recession since the 1930s. What was it that Paul Keating said? It was the recession that, according to him, we had to have. Unemployment under that recession rose to some 11 per cent. Labor could not find a solution to unemployment despite its 13 years in office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, under Labor, mortgage rates for the average family at one stage reached a staggering 17 per cent, and rates for small
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> business were even higher. Of course, it is well known that, when Labor left office, the current account deficit was out of control. Under Labor, the current account deficit reached six per cent of GDP&mdash;the highest of any industrialised country. You would think that there would be some hint of apology from this front bench, from the people who in fact presided over this dreadful record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor let government outlays get out of hand. Between 1989&hyphen;90 and 1995&hyphen;96 annual outlays went up from $89 billion to a whopping $132 billion. Of course, it is well known that Labor kept putting taxes up and up and up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition is proud of the efforts it is taking to right Labor's wrongs and to put Australia on the path to greater prosperity and greater security. The job clearly is not complete. We do not pretend, and we have never pretended, that it will be easy to turn around a ship that has been travelling in the wrong direction for 13 years. We have never pretended it is easy. But we are making good progress. We are tackling very effectively Labor's unsustainable budget deficits and we are reducing the debt which our children will have to repay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are taking the pressure off interest rates. Official interest rates have fallen three times since the election, and some home loan rates are at their lowest since the 1960s. We are helping one million Australian families with our family tax initiative. We are helping to create a better environment for small business and job creation by, among other things, providing tax relief, including through cuts in the provisional tax uplift factor; capital gains rollover relief and reduced FBT costs; cutting red tape on small business and abolishing Labor's job&hyphen;destroying unfair dismissal laws&mdash;although I notice that Labor today, again, in a press statement opposed the government's change in this area. That is a great pity and a great tragedy for small business. Of course&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins asked a number of tendentious questions obviously designed to try and excuse the inexcusable, which was Labor's deliberate policy of concentrating the noise in particular electorates that they thought made some sense in the lead&hyphen;up to the last election. The fact is we have taken decisions that have ameliorated the problem. If you are aware of particular prob
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lems, then you can bring them to the attention of the relevant authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The use of the operational mode involving aircraft take&hyphen;off to and landing from the south over Botany Bay has been somewhat limited. There have been safety concerns raised over the use of this mode following an incident on the morning of 5 January involving an international B747 and a domestic A320. These are being investigated by the bureau. There has been some increase in the use of these procedures recently. During February 1977 there was a significant drop in the level of usage of the east&hyphen;west runway due in part to persistent southerly weather, but also due to the level of traffic using the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Airservices Australia introduced new procedures on 28 March to increase the use of the east&hyphen;west runway. These involved increasing the capacity of the runway modes and relaxing certain time restrictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether or not you have figures that the number of take&hyphen;offs have increased and whether or not you are accurate in saying that the pilots have taken it upon themselves to make judgments about safety, the fact remains that there are responsible third parties who are charged with that responsibility. They are the ones that ought to make those judgments. If you have any other information to the contrary, you ought to pass it on.</PARA></ANSWER>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Earlier this year the government introduced the landmark Workplace Relations Act to free up the industrial relations system. In addition, the Prime Minister's small business statement in March this year contained a provision to further reduce the compliance burden on small business by excluding from federal unfair dismissal laws new employees of small businesses with 15 or fewer employees for their first 12 months of service. I ask the minister: what impact will the Labor Party's decision today to oppose this vital initiative have on small business and employment generally?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3148" SPEAKER="Parer, Sen Warwick" NAMEID="KI4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Resources and Energy" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank Senator Watson for that question. If anything highlights the immense gap between Labor and the coalition, it is their vastly different attitudes to small business. You would have thought that Labor would have learnt something after what happened to them on 13 March 1996. Madam President, nothing changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the gems of 13 years of Labor was the draconian unfair dismissal laws that Labor introduced to terrorise small business and penalise their attempts to employ people. Senator Cook had some words to say about this after the election. The direct result was that small business was afraid to employ anybody, and Labor scored their place in political history by achieving one million unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If small business has any view that somehow the surviving Labor team had got the message, then today's news shows that Labor's vendetta against small business is as strong as ever. To put it more kindly, all I can say is that, even after this stage, there is no way in the world that Labor even pretends or gets anywhere close to understanding what small business is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business has welcomed the coalition's move to return fairness to employment and to end Labor's crippling employment bias against small business. But Labor wants nothing to do with fairness, and now it declares it will block coalition moves to exclude workers employed in firms with 15 or fewer employees from federal unfair dismissal laws if those workers have less than a year's continuous service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Workplace Relations Act took effect from 1 January this year. It swept away Labor's complex and job destroying unfair dismissal laws. The new system itself is less legalistic, less costly and emphasises conciliation and protects employers from frivolous and malicious claims. Already we have seen a dramatic tapering off in unfair dismissal cases that have been lodged. But it has not stopped there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key initiative in the small business statement announced by the Prime Minister on 24 March was to further reduce the compliance of burden on small business by excluding from federal unfair dismissal laws new employees of small business with 15 or fewer employees in their first 12 months of service. That particular measure was unanimously endorsed by small business and small business associations throughout Australia as it removed a major disincentive for small business to employ.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3149">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note what Senator Cook himself, in fact, said. On 24 March, after the Prime Minister's announcement&mdash;and it is worth listening to&mdash;Senator Cook said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any comment that the opposition will block this legislation in the Senate is not correct.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and we will consult small business and consider its response in the appropriate time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You obviously have not consulted small business, Senator. If you had, they would have made perfectly clear to you their position with regard to the unfair dismissal provisions for those small business people with 15 employees or fewer. In fact, any criticism that we may have received on this issue which came to me from small business was: why did we limit it to 15?</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Stott Despoja for her question, of which she was kind enough to give my office some notice. She recognises, as this government does, that personal freedoms, such as an individual's right to privacy, are important. However, while it is an important issue, it is not the only one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3151">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja rightly identifies that a discussion paper was released by the Attorney on 12 September last year outlining a possible approach to privacy protection in the private sector. It was made clear at the launch of the discussion paper that its purpose was to enable the business community and the community generally to provide concrete comments on those issues. It was not an indication that the government had taken a view on how these matters should be dealt with; rather, it was a basis for discussion, as I am advised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Responses to the discussion paper have provided the government with very clear guidance as to the real concerns of business and industry on possible government approaches to privacy protection. It has been put to the government in some of these responses that there is no need at this time for a legislative response to privacy concerns. This government, as you understand, Senator, is committed to reducing the regulatory burden on business, and it is against this background that our response to the privacy concerns has been developed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message that business and industry are alarmed at the growing potential for a patchwork of state laws in relation to privacy has been clearly received by the government. At the recent Premiers Conference on 21 March, the Prime Minister urged the states to take heed of these concerns by business and industry, and the Attorney has similarly put these concerns to the state and territory attorneys. The government has decided that the Privacy Commissioner will be available to assist business in its endeavours to meet privacy standards and will be available to assist business with the development of voluntary codes of conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some business and industry sectors have already taken steps to introduce good privacy practices on a voluntary basis. The Privacy Commissioner's office has assisted with this process and is therefore experienced in working with the private sector. I understand that the Privacy Commissioner will, in the near future, be initiating a range of meetings with industry and consumer groups as a starting point for developing the codes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The short form answer of that is: yes, of course privacy is of concern to the government, as I think it is to all senators, whatever their party in this chamber. Yes, it is a matter of concern that people's privacy is protected, whoever holds the information. No, we do not believe it is appropriate at this stage to proceed by legislative path. We do believe that it is appropriate to try the voluntary code of conduct path first, and we hope that you support that.</PARA></ANSWER>

And given your comments regarding a reduction of regulatory arrangements, does this mean that the government has no plans to regulate the trade of personal information with regard to the private sector, with institutions such as banks, supermarkets, insurance companies, doctors, telephone companies, et cetera?

It is rather childish. No individual minister, no government, can guarantee anything. So it is a futile question for you to put.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I can assure consumers of is that this government is concerned about protection of their privacy. We do, however, have some faith in the private sector that their attempts to take care of their customers through voluntary codes of conduct will be successful. That is the path we intend to produce first. It is not always the case that the appropriate thing to do is to legislate. Some people get elected here and they think, `I'd better keep passing bills, otherwise I will not look like I am doing anything.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Carr for the question, because it gives me an opportunity yet again to make clear the government's intention with respect to fee paying places at Australian universities. I can answer you directly in the first instance, Senator, and say: no, I have not looked at the specific load targets in each course at each of the 37 universities. Now that you have raised that one with me, I will have a look at it and I will come back to you specifically on that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me repeat what I have told you in this place time and time and time again. The government has a very, very clear intention that universities will have to limit their fee paying places to 25 per cent, and we will be looking very carefully at universities that seek to rearrange their affairs or in any way circumvent the guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, you raised the matter of the guidelines and it is worth repeating, because some people would not have understood the confusion created by your now shadow education spokesperson either failing to read the guidelines, failing to understand them&mdash;he being a bit thick&mdash;or deliberately trying to mislead people as to the intention in those guidelines. What you will understand, Senator, that your  Labor shadow education spokesperson did was march around the country pointing to one word&mdash;transitional&mdash;saying, `See, this means they are going to let in more than 25 per cent
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> after the year 2000.' He clearly had not read them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I am sure you understand, the element of the guidelines that is transitional is the element that deals with the build&hyphen;up to the year 2000. Without that transitional element there in the build&hyphen;up to the year 2000, what would happen is that some of the more prestigious universities would be able to cream off final year students from other universities in the first two years of operation of fee paying. That would disadvantage smaller, regional, less prestigious universities. We had no intention of letting that happen and that is why we put a transitional mechanism in there. But your shadow education spokesperson ought to know, as Australians do know, that the 25 per cent limit is there in legislation and cannot be changed unless the lower House and the Senate agree that that limit should be changed.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, that is not true. Your fundamental mistake is that you state that it is our intention to minimise the Commonwealth's role. That is not correct. Our intention is to find a formula between Commonwealth&hyphen;state responsibilities that will best protect the Australian environment. In doing that, it is our view that if the Commonwealth concentrated on matters of national environmental significance, with appropriate powers and responsibilities, there would be a better outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to HECS, both the increases in the levels and the introduction of a differentiated band, have had no significant impact on enrolments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Carr said our changes would mean fewer opportunities for Australians to attend a university. That has clearly been rubbished by this data. Senator Stott Despoja predicted a drop in university enrolments. In one of the hundreds of press releases she put out&mdash;she spends every day putting three or four out&mdash;she has been proved wrong again. They had not even finalised the enrolments at the time, yet there was a claim we would have fewer enrolments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Peter Baldwin, the then education spokesperson, claimed that there would be unfilled places and a general decline in demand for university courses in another February press release. Did it happen? No, it did not. Demand for law and medicine have not collapsed&mdash;in fact, medicine and dentistry have increased. Engineering is over&hyphen;enrolled. So are teacher education, the performing arts and business courses. There are increases in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3155"> mathematics, in computing science and in a whole range of areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The partial information and rumours on applications that were circulated late last year touted the collapse of higher education. It is not the applications, rumours of application levels or reports about numbers of offers that matter. What matters is the number of people who are on the books at 31 March when they become liable for HECS. These are the figures we are talking about. This is the real evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is more. The figures also mean that there are more opportunities for Australians to go to university. They mean that Australians recognise the value of the opportunity and are willing to make an investment in their future. The increase in fee paying postgraduate places will add an estimated $12 million to university revenues. Increased Commonwealth operating grants over and above last year will add $67 million to the funds universities received last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja yet again said that overseas students have expressed concern about the government's cutbacks and the impact on higher education&mdash;prophesying doom and gloom for the export market of higher education. She will be pleased to know that there are increased enrolments of international students, which will add an estimated $92 million to the level of revenue which was available in 1996.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increases to Commonwealth funding of research will add a further $23 million in 1997&mdash;altogether another $194 million in revenue for Australian universities over what they had last year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), to a question without notice asked by Senator Margetts today, relating to environmental responsibilities of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I rise to take note of the answer that Senator Hill gave to my question in relation to the Commonwealth's responsibility in terms of the environment and the Commonwealth's lack of responsibility that has been clearly shown at the moment. The minister gave me information which is clearly incorrect. Perhaps if the minister listened to my answer instead of wondering around the chamber he might be able to respond in time and let the Senate know why he gave me incorrect information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, the minister, Senator Hill, who has not actually been listening to my response, indicated that he received advice from the Australian Heritage Commission. He did preface that remark with `I believe'. I think he ought to check back on the advice he has received from the Australian Heritage Commission in relation to the Giblett block.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The advice indicates that, given the totality of the Giblett block, more than 10 per cent of which the Department of Conservation and Land Management is proposing to trash and which is currently being resisted in as many ways as possible by the wider community, that particular coupe which is currently about to be bulldozed and trashed is the area which the Australian Heritage Commission indicated should not under any circumstances be logged, because of its ecological values. The minister ought to re&hyphen;advise the Senate of his actual information.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3159">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The advice of the Heritage Commission indicated that there may be a coupe within the Giblett block which has less ecological value than the one CALM are currently targeting at the moment. However, that is not the one that has currently had its undergrowth bulldozed and that has been damaged. This is the trashing of old-growth forests which have been recognised as having important significant values and which had interim listing on the heritage list. Basically, the minister owes the Senate an apology. The minister needs to get better advice in relation to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about the proposed harvesting operations in Giblett Hawke. Of particular concern is the location of coupes in the centre of large areas of old-growth forest in the north&hyphen;east Carey Brook subareas, Gibletts 7A and 7B, and the fragmentation of large areas of old-growth forests in the lower Donnelly subarea of operations in the Hawke block.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the Australian Heritage Commission's advice. This was the advice to the previous minister David Beddall. The minister obviously did not check back on his advice or did not have an answer ready, but remembered possibly that there might have been an area in the Giblett which they said might have been better. He has actually misled the Senate in indicating that the area that they are currently about to cut is somehow or other not considered to be important and not considered by the Australian Heritage Commission to be worth saving. The Australian Heritage Commission certainly gave exactly the opposite advice to the former minister. Nothing that I have seen indicates that anything has changed since that advice was given on 5 December 1994 to change the nature of that advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, Minister, you are coming in and claiming that you can give to the states&mdash;throw away&mdash;your power to overrule on the basis of national significance then it is about time you worked out exactly what national significance is.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the harvesting of native timbers, your position is fundamentally different from the major parties in Australia, because the major parties are not opposed to any harvesting of native forest.

If that is your starting point, then you have to oppose all of this harvesting, come what may.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the major parties basically have decided, as you know, under an agreement which is not only historic but which leads the world, to try to find a good balance between providing a sustainable resource for harvesting that can provide people with the material benefits they need, whilst at the same time developing a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system that is as good as anything that has been developed anywhere on the globe. It is that commitment that we are putting into practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the previous government, before the process got politically corrupted, my memory is that the DFA that was prepared&mdash;the scientifically based assessment as to what would be necessary for a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve, to which the AHC contributed&mdash;did not include the Giblett block.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are at liberty to tell us about that. Madam Deputy President, The question of extinguishment of native title on pastoral leases and the representations made by the National Party led to what I found to be a very strange amendment produced to the 10&hyphen;point plan. I do not know who it was that was playing members of the National Party for mugs&mdash;I do not know whether it was the Prime Minister or whether it was, indeed, the National Party's own leadership&mdash;because immediately after this debacle came about, the Prime Minister released an amendment to the 10&hyphen;point package in respect of extinguishment of native title on pastoral leases which changed it to the extent of saying that there would be extinguishment on pastoral leases which provided for exclusive possession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just thought that change was hilarious, because it was no concession whatsoever. It was no change whatsoever to the position. It was, in fact, what the High Court has said from day one. I wondered that day just who it was that was playing members of the National Party for mugs&mdash;the people who were, in fact, intended by that change to believe there had been some kind of shift in respect of the 10&hyphen;point plan. If they were not intended to believe that, then why was that silly change made?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court, ever since Mabo and including the Wik decision, has made it absolutely clear that where, legally, exclusive possession exists in a title, then native title is excluded. So I am not quite sure who it was that was playing National Party members for mugs. But I am not surprised, because, as I said in the Senate yesterday, never has a decision of the High Court of Australia been so deliberately distorted and misrepresented as the Wik decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to something that Senator Boswell has had to say, and he has repeated this many times. In respect of this real attempt at a land grab&mdash;which is the significant upgrading of the actual lease conditions themselves&mdash;let me tell you one thing that I can guarantee from a personal perspective. When this legislation comes before the Senate, if indeed it does
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> contain provisions that will result in some massive change in the Crown's current position in respect of leasehold land across Australia, then I will want to see the relevant Senate committee examine it in very close detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, it would be a great vehicle to use for actually having a look at who really does own Australia at the moment and under what conditions. I would be personally interested in pursuing that because I am genuinely angry about the way in which the High Court decision has been distorted in recent weeks to suggest that somehow or other pastoralists have been economically disadvantaged in respect of the value of their properties as a result of the Wik decision. Senator Boswell has made that claim many times. He has said that this upgrading of leases is needed so that the value of pastoral leasehold land could be restored and, to quote Senator Boswell, be put back to square one after it had been devalued by Wik.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this flood of misrepresentation, I draw the attention of all honourable senators to just one of a number of interviews given by Mr John Sheehan, a representative of the Australian Institute of Valuers and Land Economists. This is the institute that provides advice to banks and lending institutions about the value of land. This particular interview was on 25 April, Anzac Day. In response to a question about the institute's position on the value of land, Mr Sheehan said that in:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the decision of the . . . institute . . . nothing has changed. The case and the decision that came out of the case clarified the rights that were held by the pastoral lessees and probably, at the end of the day, little more than that.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the judgment in the Wik decision indicated that there were certain rights that were held by pastoral lessees, there may have been some anticipation by the holders of those leases, that they had something that was equivalent to freehold, but certainly that wasn't the case. I mean, they were holding leasehold.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They were holding leasehold land. As the institute has said previously, the rights that were held by pastoral leases are unchanged as a result of the Wik decision. I might add that is also the position of the Australian Bankers
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3163"> Association. It made a statement to a Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation meeting last year to that effect. I have checked with the association today and it has confirmed that its position has not changed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will begin by refuting the suggestion that this change to the 10&hyphen;point plan is a silly change or that there was any attempt to play anybody in our coalition for mugs. It was a very sensible explicit statement of what is in fact the common law, that we wish to clarify and confirm by statute&mdash;that is, that any title that confers exclusive possession, including pastoral leases that confer exclusive possession, will extinguish native title. That is quite accurately, as Senator Collins said, a statement of the common law, and we wish to confirm it in legislation and thus give certainty to those lessees who have exclusive possession that they do not have any native title interfering with their leases. It is a great pity that that was not made clear in the Native Title Act a great deal earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will deal with this outrageous proposition that there is some sort of land grab going on in relation to the 10&hyphen;point plan. It seems that many senators and members of the Commonwealth parliament are completely ignorant of the fact that land management in this country has been and is a function of state governments for the whole of the federation. It should and will remain a function of the state and territory parliaments. What has introduced the Commonwealth parliament into the arena is, of course, native title matters and the Racial Discrimination Act. But the states and territories have responsibility for land management. That enables them to upgrade leases. They have had that power and continue to have that power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also have powers of compulsory acquisition, and the Native Title Act passed through this parliament by this Senate provides for the continuation of compulsory acquisition powers by state parliaments and state governments. They can, as provided for in the Native Title Act now, compulsory
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> acquire native title rights where they exist on any land. That is provided for in the Native Title Act. The Native Title Act does set out that the compulsory acquisition must involve the payment of just&hyphen;terms compensation&mdash;quite properly&mdash;and if it involves the compulsory acquisition of those rights, for the benefit of a third party, it must go through a right to negotiate process. So all that we are proposing in a 10&hyphen;point plan is to build on that very proposition and that very system provided for in the Native Title Act passed by this parliament&mdash;no more and no less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will continue to allow state and territory governments to compulsorily acquire native title rights where they believe that is appropriate and within their powers over land management. If there is any proposition to upgrade a title&mdash;which, of course, those state governments have always had power to do&mdash;and that involves the acquisition of native title rights, then, as provided for in the Native Title Act now, they can do it. However, they must pay just&hyphen;terms compensation for the acquisition of those native title rights and they must follow due process. They must give the native title holders the same procedural rights as any other title holder on the land in question. We have said as a Commonwealth government that, in relation to the compensation that is paid by the state government, we will meet 75 per cent of the cost. That again is a continuation of the arrangements made by the Keating government where it committed itself to paying 75 per cent of compensation for past acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will pay 75 per cent of compensation in relation to future acts, which includes compensation resulting from compulsory acquisition. However, we have a very clear caveat on that payment of the 75 per cent compensation: that is, if it involves the upgrading of any title of the kind that has been described, the state or territory must charge a betterment factor that must reflect the increase in the commercial value of the title granted to the title holder. If in upgrading from a pastoral lease to a freehold one, which has always been a prerogative of those governments, there is an increase in the value to the title holder as a result of that upgrade and following any
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3164"> compulsory  acquisition of native title rights, that title holder must be charged the commercial value of the difference between the two titles. That must be used to offset the compensation cost. So, when the state government receives that revenue from the charging of the betterment factor, that must then be offset against the compensation that is payable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no sleight of hand here. There is no land grab here. Senator Collins talks about people distorting the High Court decision. There has been no distortion of the High Court decision. It had very serious implications for pastoral leases. The distortion that is involved is in relation to this so&hyphen;called `land grab', which is an outrageous proposition. What we are proposing is quite fair and quite proper&mdash;a continuation of the regime established by your government under the Native Title Act and supported by this Senate. It will involve fair and just terms and fairness to native title holders.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3168"> In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable `active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator Brown</NAME><FROM>(from five citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER>, <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="AX5">Senator Chris Evans</NAME><FROM>(from five citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER>,

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACTUARIAL STANDARDS&mdash;COMMENCEMENT ISSUES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter dated 17 March 1997, concerning issues relating to the commencement of certain actuarial standards made by the Life Insurance Actuarial Standards Board (the "Board") for the purposes of the Life Insurance Act 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I sought a response to the matters raised in your letter from the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (the "Commission"), which I have now received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The actuarial standards entitled "Transitional Provisions for the Calculation of Paid Up Values and Surrender Values and Calculation of the Cost of Investment Performance Guarantees" issued December 1996</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are actually two separate standards (dealing with calculation of paid up and surrender values and calculation of the cost of investment performance guarantees) which were made and issued at the same time. As you point out, these standards apply in respect of calculations made on or after 31 December 1996 but, although made on 16 December 1996, they were not gazetted until 22 January 1997.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3172">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The standard dealing with the calculation of the cost of investment performance guarantees does not make any substantive changes to the previous standard dealing with this topic. Hence, it does not adversely affect rights or impose any new liabilities, and is not invalidated by subsection 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The standard dealing with the calculation of paid up values and surrender values is in a different position. Although it is substantially similar to the previous standard dealing with this topic, there are a few differences which could, in some circumstances, have an adverse effect on life insurance companies. This being the case, it must be taken to be invalidated by subsection 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both standards were meant to have been gazetted on or before 31 December 1996 along with a large number of other statutory instruments that were made at the same time, but they were inadvertently left out of the package of documents that were sent to the gazette office. The omission was only noticed in January. That is why they were not gazetted until 22 January 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To rectify the problem, the Board will re&hyphen;make the standard dealing with calculation of paid up values and surrender values. After it is re&hyphen;made it will of course be gazetted and laid before Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To avoid any doubt, the invalid version of this standard will be formally revoked. A note to the instrument of revocation will explain that it was invalid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The "transitional actuarial standard" referred to in Commissioner's rules number 27</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rule 4 of Commissioner's rules number 27 applies the Actuarial Standard for Valuation of Policy Liabilities issued in June 1995 (which it calls the "transitional actuarial standard"). In fact, contrary to the suggestion in the last paragraph of your letter, the new Actuarial Standard for Valuation of Policy Liabilities that replaced the standard of June 1995 is not one of the standards discussed above, but is a different standard that was made in October 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commissioner's rules number 27 has deliberately applied the standard of June 1995 as the "transitional actuarial standard". The reason is that under rule 6 of those rules, the "transitional actuarial standard" determines the liabilities of the relevant category of business of the life company as at the end of the preceding financial year, and the preceding financial year (defined in rule 3) is the financial year ending immediately before the starting date. Starting dates for life companies are set only once, and will fall in the period 1 January 1996 to 30 December 1996, depending upon their balance date. Therefore, the standard of June 1995, rather than the later one effective 31 December 1996, has been used in these Commissioner's rules because it is the standard that was in force at the time to which rule 6 relates. It is obviously fairer to use the standard that applied at the relevant time than a standard that only came into force later.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. General issues relating to revocation and numbering of actuarial standards</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to avoid possible confusion, all future new actuarial standards will expressly revoke their predecessors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, it is recognised that the naming of the succession of transitional actuarial standards made thus far can be confusing to lay people, due to the fact that often several different individual standards have been issued together, under a collective name. However, there has been no confusion in the industry, as the standards are always issued to the industry accompanied by adequate explanatory material. Since issuing its first non&hyphen;transitional actuarial standard in October 1996, the Board has adopted a numbering convention. New actuarial standards, other than any remaining transitional standards, deal with only one topic and will be given their own individual number (noting that the paid up and surrender value standards are considered as one standard due to their interdependent nature). This will make it easy to identify particular standards and will generally help to avoid confusion. The numbering convention adopted is as follows:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 20 February 1997 concerning the National Crime Authority Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1996 No 286.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your letter notes that the form of warrant (Form 4) for the arrest of a witness under section 31 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 does not include the protective safeguard authorising the use of "such force as may be reasonably necessary". By comparison, those words are included in the form
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of search warrant (Form 1) under section 22 of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason for the difference is apparent from a comparison of the language of sections 22 and 31. Subsection 22(2) expressly provides that the warrant may be carried out "with such assistance as he (the person named in the warrant) thinks necessary and if necessary by force." Section 31, on the other hand, does not contain a similar qualification in describing the way the warrant may be executed under subsections 31(2) and (2A).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Form 1 is structured in the context of the language used in section 22, including the reference to the use of force in carrying out the warrant. Similarly, Form 4 is drawn in terms that are consistent with section 31, which does not mention the use of force. It is not so much a case of excluding a reference to the use of reasonable force in Form 4 but rather one of not having a similar legislative basis for its inclusion.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 17 March 1997 to Senator the Honourable Robert Hill concerning the Mining Legislation (Amendment) Ordinances 1996 for the Territories of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. As I am responsible for matters relating to territories, your letter has been referred to me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is one phosphate mine on Christmas Island, which is operated by a local company, Phosphate Resources Ltd (PRL), under a current 10 year lease with the Commonwealth. There is also a small sand and gravel quarry. The Cocos (Keeling) Islands have no mining operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new 21 year lease under the applied WA mining legislation is being negotiated with PRL. Phosphate reserves on the lease are anticipated to last less than the 21 year period of the lease. As land is scarce on the Island, the mined areas are to be rehabilitated and returned to the Commonwealth to allow development and/or incorporation into the Christmas Island National Park. The lease contains a schedule for the surrender of mined areas, which will be reviewed by both parties every two years. PRL will have the right to apply for a renewal of the lease if new reserves are identified or new technology extends the life of the mine. The Commonwealth will give consideration to the renewal having regard to the impact on the economy, the environment and the community. Such a renewal would need to be of clear benefit to the local community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PRL and the Western Australian Department of Minerals and Energy were consulted about the making of the amendments to the applied mining legislation. PRL sought independent legal advice on the amendments, and were satisfied that their rights were protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no right of appeal against any decisions of the Minister in the Mining Act 1978 (WA)(CI)
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (CKI) (the Act). All applications for mining tenements, forfeitures, exemptions from expenditure conditions etc are heard, either by the mining registrar or the mining warden in open court.</PARA>

Some decisions made by the mining registrar or the mining warden may be appealed to the Minister. The Act specifically excludes a right of appeal in certain cases in section 151. Appeals from decisions of the mining warden to the Supreme Court are permitted in certain circumstances by section 147. Copies of relevant sections are attached.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 25 February 1997 referring to the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employees) (National Standards) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1996 No 288 (the Regulations).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has suggested that it may be appropriate to provide for review of a decision made by the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission (the Commission) relating to the imposition of a condition of exemption from a licence, under regulation 4.40B of the Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is considered that this provision is not necessary. In relation to licences, regulation 4.63 provides for review of decisions made by the Commission to refuse to grant or renew a licence; or to cancel suspend or vary (or refuse to vary) a licence. In relation to design registration, regulation 4.63 further provides for review of a Commission decision refusing to register a design; or to vary a condition of licence as a consequence of a breach of a condition of design registration (paragraph 4.63(e)). With the exception of this last provision, regulation 4.63 provides for review of Commission decisions which directly affect employers by denying them a licence or design registration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intention of subregulation 4.53(3) is that it is to provide a less final alternative to the decisions available to the Commission referred to in the earlier parts of regulation 4.63.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These decisions should be contrasted to the decisions made by the Commission in setting conditions, in paragraph 4.53(1)(d) and regulation 4.40B of the Regulations. Both are procedural provisions and have no substantial immediate consequences,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and so little commercial effect, on employers. For this reason, decisions made under the former provision are not reviewable and decisions made under regulation 4.40B should also not be reviewable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have also asked for advice on why the Commission is not required to consult with the holder of an exemption before cancelling (subregulation  4.40C(3) of the Regulations).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subregulation 4.40C(2) of the Regulations sets out various situations in which the Commission must cancel an exemption. The first three of these conditions or situations (paragraphs 4.40C(a) to (c)) are situations of fact. The condition or situation in paragraph 4.40C(d) requires an objective test by the Commission. It is considered that the factual or objective nature of these conditions lead to a consequence that, while the Commission can consult if it chooses to do this, it should not be required to do so in every case. I have been advised that it is more likely, as a matter of good administrative practice, that the Commission will consult with the employer concerned rather than not doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph 4.40C(e) of the Regulations provides that an exemption may be cancelled at the request of the employer. It is again considered that this is not a situation in which the Commission should be required, by the legislation, to consult with the employer concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In each of these cases, an employer will either be aware that State or Territory licence provisions no longer cover them or that these provisions are not adequate, or the employer will in fact no longer want an exemption which has been granted. For this reason, it is considered that cancellation without consultation is not pre&hyphen;emptory nor will its consequences be damaging to the employer concerned.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The "strict liability" provision (r.38)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first concern that you mention is the strict liability provision in regulation 38. This provision applies to all offences under the Regulations, except offences under Division 3 of Part 4. The offence provisions are, in fact, contained in Divisions 1, 2 and 3 of Part 4. Therefore, strict liability applies only to offences under Divisions 1 and 2. (As mentioned in the note to subregulation 38(1), strict liability is dealt with in s.6.1 of the Criminal Code.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The essential reason for applying strict liability to most offences under the Regulations is the importance of ensuring that the safety provisions (including the provisions in Safety Cases applying to particular facilities) are complied with. In my view this is justified, because the operation of the types of facility in question (such as oil rigs) is potentially hazardous, and an accident could have catastrophic consequences. The maintenance of safety is therefore a matter of the highest importance. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Piper Alpha</EMPHASIS>  disaster in the UK is a clear reminder
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of what can happen if safety provisions are not strictly enforced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Division 1 of Part 4 applies only to the "operators" and "titleholders" (as defined in subregulation 3(1)) of facilities, and in practice such operators and titleholders will invariably be bodies corporate. The operation of a facility is a large commercial undertaking that involves major responsibilities in regard to safety. The imposition of strict liability, with substantial maximum penalties, where these entities contravene the relevant provisions, is therefore considered to be justified and necessary to ensure due compliance with these essential safety provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The offences in Division 2 of Part 4 will in practice apply primarily to individuals working on or in relation to facilities, and in view of this circumstance the maximum penalties for these offences are comparatively low, namely 10 penalty units ($1,000) or, in the case of regulation 35 (interference with accident sites), 20 penalty units ($2,000). Bearing in mind these levels of penalty and the safety considerations that are involved, it is considered that the imposition of strict liability is justified and appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By contrast, the offence provisions in Division 3 of Part 4 carry as the maximum penalty the highest level of penalty, namely 100 penalty units ($10,000), allowed by the Act (under para. 157(5)(a). This is because they are the most serious type of offence (endangering, or interfering with, the safety of a person on a facility or the safe operation of a facility). These offences apply to individuals as well as to bodies corporate, and it is felt that the imposition of strict liability would not be appropriate. Rather, the offences are directed at intentional or reckless conduct (s.5.6 of the Criminal Code refers).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The "double jeopardy" provision (r.39)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your other concern relates to subregulation 39(2). Subregulation 39(1) contains a provision against "double jeopardy" by providing that a person is not liable to be punished, in respect of the same act or omission, for more than 1 offence under the Regulations. Subregulation (2) provides that subregulation (1) does not prevent conviction and punishment for 2 or more offences merely because the same act or omission was a common element of each of the offences (for example, in cases where offence "A" had elements 1, 2 and 3, and offence "B" had elements 3, 4 and 5).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter has been reviewed, in consultation with the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, and I agree that subregulation (2) appears, as you suggest, to take away a lot of the protection given by subregulation (1). This was not an intended consequence. Arguably, subregulation (2) could be given a narrow interpretation if the matter were to be tested in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3177"> court. However, I accept that the matter is open to doubt and, in the circumstances, I feel that subregulation (2) should be repealed. Accordingly, this will be done at the earliest practicable opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope that this letter has adequately addressed your committee's concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should like to thank you for drawing these matters to my attention.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee sought advice on whether there is review of any adverse decisions made by the Spectrum Management Agency (SMA) under regulation 4. Regulation 4 of the rules, which are made under section 182 of the Radiocommunications Act 1992 (the Act), provides for the appointment and revocation of appointment of competent bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no provision for merits review of adverse decisions of the SMA under the rules. The decisions do not appear to fall within the Administrative Review Council's suggested exceptions to review as outlined in its Seventeenth Annual Report and would seem to be appropriate for merits review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I would ask you to reconsider the disallowance motion moved on 18 March 1997 on the basis that the rules will cease to exist as at 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1997 recently passed by Parliament, amends sections 182 and 183 of the Act to provide that competent bodies will be determined under section 183 of the Act, not under subordinate legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advice from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department indicates that the Australian Communications Authority determinations dealt with by section 183 are legislative rather than administrative in character and should not therefore be subject to administrative review processes.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this context r.98T provides that an electoral official "must" send ballot papers. Under r.98ZP, which provides for matters similar to rr.98ZN, 98ZO and 98ZQ, a company "must" register certain shares and debentures. The Committee would appreciate your advice.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 17 March 1997 concerning the Workplace Relations Regulations (Amendment), SR 1996 No. 328.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have sought my advice on a number of matters in relation to these regulations and I will address each matter in turn.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 980&mdash;Access to Roll of Voters</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subregulation 980(2) provides that members of an amalgamated organisation or any other persons authorised by an electoral official may inspect and take copies of the roll of voters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have sought my advice on the reasons for this and on why the roll is not available for public inspection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that this regulation is the equivalent of existing regulation 81 which provides for the inspection of the roll of voters for a ballot concerning amalgamation of organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The roll is available to members and other authorised persons so that persons interested in various aspects of an election such as, for example, the number of persons entitled to vote in the election, may obtain this information. It may also be sought to enable material on the issues in the ballot to be sent to voters. For members of the organisations concerned in the ballot there is an obvious interest in having access to the roll of voters. In addition, there may be other persons who have a legitimate interest in the roll who may apply to the electoral officer for access.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The roll of voters is not publicly available for a number of reasons. First, although the conduct of the ballots (or elections) of registered organisations is regulated to some extent by statute, such ballots are not public elections in the same way as parliamentary elections. The outcome of the ballot affects the members of the organisation, not the public generally. There is therefore no need for the roll to be a public document.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Registered organisations are voluntary associations of individuals. Members of such organisations should not have the fact of their membership compulsorily disclosed whether through a roll of voters or otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, in the negotiation of a certified agreement between an employer and employees, an employee may request that their registered organisation represent them in the negotiations for the agreement. Section 291A of the Act provides that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Industrial Registrar may issue a certificate that an employee has made such a request. This certificate must not identify any of the employees concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 98P, 98ZN, 98ZO, 98ZQ&mdash;Use of the term "may"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have sought advice as to why, in these regulations, the permissive "may" has been used rather than the mandatory "must".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulations 98P</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This regulation is the equivalent of existing regulation 83.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a fundamental principle of administrative law that a public official entrusted by legislation with a discretionary power will normally be under a duty to exercise that power when the appropriate circumstances arise (Murphyores Incorporate Pty Ltd v. Commonwealth (1979) 136CLR1). An electoral official conducting a ballot is therefore under an obligation to exercise the discretion under regulation 98P where he or she considers it reasonably necessary to ensure that no unlawful disclosure or other irregularity occurs. A failure on the part of such an official to act in appropriate circumstances could lead to an application for a writ of mandamus. Given this, it is considered that the use of the word "must" would not impose any greater requirement on the official to ensure that no unlawful disclosure or other irregularity occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulations 98ZN, 98ZO, 98ZQ</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These regulations provide for certificates to be issued which provide the authority for effect to be given to the change in ownership or holding of various interests, such as land, charges and other assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These regulations are the equivalent of sections 253Y, 253Z and 253ZB of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. I am advised that it is the usual practice of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel not to draft provisions in such a way as to impose obligations on the officials of a State or Territory. Attached, for your information, is a copy of section 38 of the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Act 1991 which is drafted in the same manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 98ZP which provides for a certificate to be given in relation to the change in ownership of shares provides that where the new organisation becomes the holder of a share, debenture or interest, the company must register the change in ownership of a share, debenture or interest in the company. This regulation (which is the equivalent of section 253ZA) imposes obligations on a company and is no different from the Commonwealth imposing obligations through the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that regulation 98ZO which deals with the Australian Securities Commission (a Common
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3180"> wealth body) presumably could have been drafted so as to require the ASC to deal with a certificate relating to the assignment of charge as if it were a notice of assignment; however, the regulations were drafted to be consistent with their equivalent sections in Division 7 of Part IX of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and as such the term "may" has been used in this regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 98T</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again, this regulation is the equivalent of existing regulation 89.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regulations 98M and 98ZI, the use of the word "reasonable" is intended to limit the number of ways in which an electoral official could be required to notify voters of the date of ballot and the outcome of the ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to regulation 98T, it is a requirement of administrative law that a public official exercising a power do so lawfully, which includes a requirement that the power be exercised reasonably. If the electoral official unreasonably determined that material was not relevant to a ballot, or alternatively, unreasonably determined that certain material was relevant, a person affected by the official's decision (such as a voter or candidate) could challenge this decision on the grounds that it was not reasonable for him or her to have so decided. The omission of the word "reasonably" in the regulation does not affect this position. However, I am happy to make an amendment to regulation 98T to include the word "reasonably" when the regulations are next amended.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government regards the issues arising from the break&hyphen;up of the former Yugoslavia as ones to be addressed primarily by the major world powers and European countries generally, in cooperation with the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conformity with long&hyphen;standing bi&hyphen;partisan policy not to participate directly in multilateral military or related operations in the former Yugoslavia, Australia decided not to contribute to the United Nations International Police Task Force operating in Bosnia or the United Nations International Transitional Police Force in Eastern Slavonia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government places a high priority on maintaining its support for the United Nations, particularly in participation in peace operations. Requests for participation in such operations are considered on a case by case basis taking into account our standard criteria, which include, amongst others, whether the operation has a clear and achievable mandate, clear and achievable goals and clearly defined termination or review points; whether there is a prospect for a satisfactory outcome given the UN resource commitment and the political nature of the situation; and how much Australian interests are engaged including regional, alliance and humanitarian interests and community attitudes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia was not invited to participate in the NATO&hyphen;led Implementation Force&mdash;IFOR.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following a request from the United Kingdom, the Government has approved the deployment of six Australian Defence Force (ADF) officers to serve with the British forces in the former Yugoslavia for three rotations of six months from February 1997.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In otherwise providing strong support for the peace process, Australia has made a significant contribution to humanitarian and other assistance to the people of the former Yugoslavia. Since 1991, we have contributed assistance worth some $9.5 million, largely through multilateral agencies such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross; supported the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal; and issued some 20,000 visas for resettlement in Australia.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will keep under examination the question of further assistance to the war&hyphen;affected peoples of the former Yugoslavia and will continue its support for the full implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement, while recognising that these are matters of primary concern to the major global powers and the countries of Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Comment </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The international community, through the World Bank and other agencies, is actively involved in assessing Bosnia and Herzegovina's needs and developing a plan for reconstruction. It has been estimated that $US5.1 billion will be required over the next three to four years to rehabilitate essential physical infrastructure, as well as to reconstruct schools and hospitals and to provide social support and demobilisation services. A donors' pledging conference, held in Brussels in April 1996, saw the target reached of some $US1.8 billion for 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and AusAID appeared before the Committee in November 1995, the Australian Government has provided a further $1.75 million in humanitarian assistance for the winter appeal issued by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the human rights field operation of the UN Commissioner for Human Rights. These contributions brought total humanitarian assistance to over $5 million in 1995/96 financial year and were consistent with the approach hitherto taken to help meet immediate humanitarian needs and to support international agencies in providing non&hyphen;discriminatory aid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the scale of needs, Australia cannot play a prominent role in the reconstruction effort. Australia has allocated $1 million for the former Yugoslavia in 1996/97. The reduction in allocation, compared to the previous year, reflects the Government's current budgetary constraints and the large demands for emergency humanitarian assistance in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> other parts of the world including Zaire, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. Australia's contribution will be provided to meet the continuing humanitarian needs in the region and to provide support for reconstruction efforts, particularly in areas where Australia has particular expertise, such as, involvement with institution building in the fields of human rights and democratic elections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for humanitarian assistance will continue in parallel with the reintegration and repatriation program. The three million refugees, displaced persons and other war&hyphen;affected people across the region will be dependent for some time on international assistance. The situation of refugees and displaced persons affects not only Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Slovenia. A regional and even&hyphen;handed approach to providing humanitarian assistance will continue to be necessary, and sympathetic consideration will be given to channelling any further Australian assistance through international agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation Three</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has provided an additional $20 million over four years for settlement services. Consideration is being given to using some of this funding for developing an integrated humanitarian settlement strategy. The strategy will provide a more holistic approach to humanitarian settlement, building on partnerships with other service providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government makes every effort to minimise the difficulties associated with settlement of humanitarian entrants, and notes that humanitarian entrants fall into two groups: (a) those with relatively well established proposers in Australia (some Special Humanitarian Program (SHP) entrants and all Special Assistance Category (SAC); and (b) those with limited links with Australia (refugees and the remainder of the SHP entrants).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) With some exceptions, the Government does not participate directly in the settlement of entrants who are proposed by family or friends who are primarily responsible for their accommodation and settlement. However, through the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Government does assist indirectly in their settlement
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3187"> through the funding of Migrant Resource Centres (MRCs) and Grants&hyphen;in&hyphen;Aid (GIA). Concessional entry of people in these categories depends on the availability in Australia of support from their proposers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Information on settlement and community services is available from GIA workers, many of them based at MRCs. Some MRCs run information sessions for new arrivals. Others are training bi&hyphen;cultural workers to run information sessions within their own communities.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) In determining the placement of those humanitarian entrants with limited links to Australia, overseas officers of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs take into account: the presence of relatives or friends living in a particular place; the availability of On Arrival Accommodation (OAA); and need for the Community Refugee Settlement Scheme (CRSS) support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OAA is made available to those refugee and SHP entrants who have no other accommodation available. It is located in proximity to support services.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has allocated funding for a campaign to combat racist attitudes and behaviour which will be implemented in schools, workplaces, sporting organisations and other sections of the community.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not propose to incorporate legal advice on war crimes in the on&hyphen;arrival information package.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is very conscious of the effect, and the cost, illicit narcotics have on the Australian community. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Australian Federal Police maintain close liaison with other governments and agencies through the Government's posts in the South East Asian region in an effort to reduce the supply, and the demand for illicit narcotics. One area where Australia can make an impact is through co&hyphen;operative training programs such as those conducted by Australian law enforcement agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Australian Customs Service (ACS) are supportive of the concept of a cooperative regional training program covering narcotics prevention and control, aimed at Burma and other South East Asian countries such as Laos and Vietnam. Both the AFP and the ACS have been actively involved in a number of similar regional projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This type of activity would lead to increased cooperative arrangements between the relevant Australian agencies and our neighbours in Burma and South East Asia. Clearly it is in Australia's best interest to play a significant role in the criminal investigation environment in our region of influence by exercising leadership, showing direction and cooperative initiatives, both at the micro (local training etc) and macro (wider intelligence, mutual assistance etc) levels. This is as much to Australia's benefit as to that of our regional neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However the Government has limited human and financial resources to commit to such a project. Careful consideration would need to be given to human resource requirements and possible sources of funding before any final commitments were made.

This would also have the advantage of ensuring that this proposal does not cut across similar initiatives being undertaken by other organisations.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia strongly objects to piracy wherever it occurs. Any ADF maritime platforms, such as ships or aircraft, that encountered piracy on the high seas would go to the assistance of the victim, in accordance with our obligations under international law. In practice, however, it is often difficult to identify perpetrators unless they are caught in the act of piracy. In addition, aircraft have a very limited  capacity to respond directly to activities occurring on the surface. A legal constraint is that piratical acts that occur within territorial seas are classified under international law as criminal acts, and foreign platforms have no authority to intervene. A large part of the waters of South East Asia is claimed as territorial seas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless Australia's cooperative defence training and exercise activities with regional countries do contribute to regional countries' capabilities to counter piracy. For example, the Department of Defence provides training annually to the Royal Thai Navy and Air Force in maritime
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> air surveillance, and participates in maritime exercises with the Royal Thai Navy. While the primary intention of these activities is to enhance professional military skills, the training is directly relevant to Thailand's anti&hyphen;piracy efforts. This training is also available to most other ASEAN countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no formal regional programs to combat piracy in South East Asia. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the International Maritime Bureau (IMB), part of the International Chamber of Commerce, compile figures on the incidence of piracy and the Regional Piracy Centre (RPC), established in Kuala Lumpur in September 1992 by IMB with IMO involvement, monitors the piracy situation in South East Asian waters. In Australia, piracy issues are dealt with by AMSA, which represents Australia on the IMO's Piracy Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1992 Australia raised its concerns about piracy both with individual ASEAN countries and at the 1992 ASEAN PMC. Following the PMC, Indonesia and Singapore set up a bilateral arrangement to undertake coordinated patrols in the Singapore Straits, with some success. Given some sensitivities relating to issues of sovereignty and interpretation of international law, these bilateral arrangements were seen by key regional countries as preferable to a regional approach. However, continuing interest in region&hyphen;wide cooperation on this issue is reflected in it being a topic for discussion at the 1996 ASEAN PMC. In the context of the new security body in the region, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), piracy is a topic for further discussions, in the first instance in the second track, ie, academic level discussions in which officials participate in their personal capacities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Customs Service has no expertise in this area, but would be willing to enter into consultations should it be felt that the ACS possesses skills that could be utilised in any program being developed to assist Thai and other regional authorities to deal more effectively with this problem.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 24 February 1994 the Senate asked its Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee to inquire into arts and cultural education. The terms of reference covered: the level and status of education in the arts and the involvement of students in Australian educational institutions; current training practices, skills levels and involvement by teachers and the general community in providing arts education in educational institutions; the allocation of resources to arts education in educational institutions and the use of these resources; and the consistency of arts education policies and programs within and between educational institutions and States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government welcomes the Committee's report, as an important contribution to arts education across Australia. The Commonwealth Government recognises that arts educators have an important role in the holistic development of students' creativity, expression, and aesthetic appreciation, knowledge and skills. In addition, arts education can enhance quality learning in all curriculum learning areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that much of people's experiences of the arts is derived from sources other than those provided through formal education, including family and community experiences, as well as those provided through national cultural institutes supported by the Commonwealth Department of Communications and the Arts. The Senate Report seems to be limited to institutional issues of interest to arts educators.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issues raised by the Inquiry relate to programs for schools, especially those directed towards curriculum, key competencies and professional development, and to vocational education and training, and higher education policy. These policies and programs are administered by the Commonwealth Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DEETYA). To some extent the issues also relate to programs administered by the Commonwealth Department of Communications and the Arts (DOCA). The
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Government's response has been compiled from inputs from these two Departments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's report is based on the 131 written submissions, most of which were from arts educators and organisations representing arts educators. The submissions and the Committee's discussion of them covered a number of concerns:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that arts education policy and practice should not be determined by economic and employment needs, and that an overemphasis on the market economy in government policy has marginalised the true value of arts education;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that curriculum statements and profiles for Australian schools and the key competencies could have a negative impact on arts education on the basis that the establishment of clearly defined standards and outcomes and an emphasis on competencies are inappropriate for the arts curriculum learning area; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that arts disciplines are disadvantaged under current funding arrangements and as a consequence tend to lose status in the university relative to other areas of learning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important, therefore, for the discussion which follows in the Government's response, to put these concerns in the general context of DEETYA programs relating to national collaborative curriculum, key competencies, funding for higher education, vocational education and training and relevant programs administered by DOCA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Introduction, Section 1 of the Government's response, provides the general context of relevant Commonwealth programs, while Section 2, Commonwealth Programs Relating to the Arts, summarises past and current initiatives, including those related to the education reforms mentioned above.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parts of the Committee's report reflect certain misunderstandings about existing Commonwealth programs. For example, in relation to the curriculum statements and profiles, called "the national curriculum" in the Report, it is said that the arts statement and profile "attempt to squeeze artistic activity into the restrictive mould, . . . .. determined by the needs of vocational training" (p.vi) and that the arts profile may encourage teachers to teach skills so that they can judge whether or not the student achieved the outcome, ignoring how well the outcome was achieved.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3215"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the arts statement and profile identify five particular art forms, they do not prescribe arbitrary standards and uniformity but, rather, provide for systems and schools to accommodate a wide range of approaches to teaching, learning and assessment. The arts statement and profile are intended to provide a common but broad and flexible framework for curriculum development by education systems and schools and a common language for reporting student achievement to students, parents, schools, systems and employers. They also do not prescribe levels of priority or time allocations to any of the learning areas or strands within them. These are matters which are determined by education systems and schools based on their needs and priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report does not give a great deal of consideration to the relationship of the arts area to other learning areas, including the priority and perspective accorded by educators, system authorities and parents. It also gives very little attention to equality of access to arts and cultural education, particularly in settings outside formal learning institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statements and profiles were prepared as part of a national collaborative curriculum development process, commencing in 1989 and involving the State, Territory and Commonwealth governments. The curriculum statements and profiles are part of a collaborative process to improve education in Australia which is being supported by Commonwealth programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the significant programs in this process is the National Professional Development Program. This program allows project grantees wide flexibility within program guidelines to design professional development activity. The project which is noted in the response to recommendation 12, for example, included funding for a national Australian Arts Education Conference which enabled arts educators, artists and policy makers to examine developments in arts education, to explore options for future directions and to produce a draft set of principles for arts education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, the Government believes that parts of the Committee's report reflect certain misunderstandings among the arts education community about the key competencies. In Chapter 4 of the Report, there is substantial discussion about the fears and concerns of the arts education community relating to the key competencies. The Government acknow ledges the importance of these concerns and believes that there are a number of current initiatives that address them, particularly under the Commonwealth's Key Competencies Program, through 1994&hyphen;96 funding provided to the State and Territory Government pilots and the 1995&hyphen;96 funding provided to the National Affiliation of Arts Educators. These initiatives are described in Section 3.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee itself identifies some of these misunderstandings. The Government notes and regrets that the Report did not dispel these concerns by referring to the Finn and Mayer reports. For example, the report concludes that "the key competencies are not essential for everyone in all jobs" (p.124), but had the Committee referred to the Mayer report (p.viii) it could have clarified the intention of the key competencies and the need for all young people to acquire them to participate effectively in the emerging forms of work and work organisation. A discussion in the report on emerging forms of work and work organisation in the Arts may have been helpful here. On page 127, the report refers to a confusion about the purposes of the key competencies and whether they are limited to vocational training. But reference to (p.5) of the Finn report and (p.xiv) of the Mayer report would have clarified the role of the key competencies in regard to general and vocational education and training within schools and their role in promoting flexible post&hyphen;school education and training pathways.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Higher Education</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Commonwealth funding to higher education institutions is in the form of a single block operating grant to cover teaching and research activities. As autonomous organisations, universities are responsible for the distribution of funds between faculties based on their assessment of priorities and needs so that they can provide a diversity of quality educational offerings that enable people to develop their talents and allow them to participate as fully as possible in society.

This is incorrect. The Commonwealth Government provides each higher education institution with a single block operating grant on a triennial basis for a specified level of student load within the context of an educational profile which covers its teaching and research activities. The amount of operating grant an institution receives in any given year is based on the level of funds it received in the previous year, plus or minus any growth or downward adjustment in its Commonwealth funded load. Growth places in recent years have been funded on an average cost of a place regardless of the disciplines involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The RFM was a one&hyphen;off exercise to establish funding relativities among institutions and as a mechanism to move institutions to within an acceptable band of funding variation, thereby enhancing their capacity to compete on equal terms in the UNS. The model comprised a teaching related component designed to reflect the relative costs of teaching in different discipline cost clusters at different levels, and research related component to support research activities and associated research infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A relative teaching costs matrix was developed to distribute the teaching component of the model's allocations on the basis of an institution's particular mix of disciplines and levels. While it is recognised that a considerable amount of variation occurs

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, this bill provides a framework for Australia to participate in the international transfer of prisoners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the bill is to enable Australians imprisoned overseas, and foreign nationals imprisoned in Australia, to be returned to their home countries to complete the serving of their sentences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increases in international air travel and criminal activity have resulted in a rise in the number of persons serving terms of imprisonment in foreign countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Participation in international prisoner transfers is important for Australia for both domestic and international reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are sound humanitarian and rehabilitative grounds for international prisoner transfers.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3229"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, such transfers may result in practical benefits in terms of prison administration, as well as relieving some of the pressure on the consular services of Australian missions overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is possible that Australian participation in international prisoner transfers may also result in financial savings for some participating States and Territories if there is a net outflow of prisoners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the international perspective, a large number of countries are very supportive of prisoner transfer schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years, there has been growing pressure for Australia to participate, and Australia has been approached by various countries about this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, participation in prisoner transfers will enhance and supplement Australia's relations with other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, apart from providing a framework for general transfer of prisoners, the bill will also enable persons who have been convicted by certain international war crimes tribunals to be transferred to Australia to serve their sentences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As honourable senators will be aware, two international war crimes tribunals were established in 1993 and 1994 by the United Nations Security Council to deal with war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The International War Crimes Tribunals Act 1995 enables Australia to assist and comply with requests from the Tribunals, including the arrest and surrender of accused persons to the Tribunals and other assistance such as the taking of evidence in Australia for Tribunal purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Persons convicted by the Tribunals are to serve their sentences in countries designated by the Tribunals from a list of countries which have indicated to the Security Council their willingness to accept such prisoners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of countries have already agreed to accept Tribunal prisoners, and the President of the former Yugoslavia Tribunal has sought advice as to Australia's willingness to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's acceptance of Tribunal prisoners will be subject to the qualification that the prisoners have a connection with Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions in the bill enabling transfers from the Tribunals will complement the International War Crimes Tribunals Act 1995.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The participating States and Territories will need to enact complementary legislation.</PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, I now mention some of the important features of the provisions dealing with general prisoner transfers between Australia and other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is drafted in such a way that the transfer scheme is able to apply to all offences without exception.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It covers persons who have been convicted of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment or other deprivation of liberty, and includes persons confined in connection with criminal conduct by reason of mental disorder, and persons who have been released on parole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A significant requirement is that all transfers must be consensual, requiring the consent of the person to be transferred, the Australian Government (Commonwealth and State/Territory where relevant) and the Government of the other country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains certain prerequisites which must be satisfied before transfers can take place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These include:

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">imprisonment under a final order, whereby neither the sentence of imprisonment nor the relevant conviction is subject to appeal;</PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, I now turn to the provisions dealing with transfers of prisoners from the international war crimes tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are some differences from the general prisoner transfer scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These differences take account of the different nature and objectives of the transfer of Tribunal prisoners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intention is that a Tribunal prisoner would not be transferred to Australia unless he or she has some connection with Australia and the Australian Government has consented to the transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main differences in relation to Tribunal prisoners are that consent from the Tribunal prisoner is not a mandatory requirement, and there are no explicit citizenship or migration requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On this point, I wish to draw to honourable senators' attention that the bill provides that no decision affecting a person who is not an Australian citizen can be made unless the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs consents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Sentence enforcement</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A central issue in international prisoner transfers is the question as to how sentences imposed in other countries or the Tribunals will be enforced in Australia following transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 6 of the bill addresses this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill sets out two different methods for enforcement in Australia of a sentence of imprisonment imposed on a prisoner or Tribunal prisoner by a court or tribunal of a transfer country or by a Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These methods are consistent with those set out in the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of Sentenced Persons (Council of Europe Convention).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that the Attorney-General may direct that the sentence of imprisonment be enforced on the transfer of the prisoner to Australia under the act:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">without any adaptation or with only such adaptation as is considered necessary to ensure consistency with Australian law&mdash;this is referred to as the continued enforcement method; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">by substituting a different sentence&mdash;this is referred to as the converted enforcement method.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the bill provides for a choice between two different forms of sentence enforcement, the method actually adopted in a particular case will depend on the agreement with the country or the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, if a bilateral treaty with a particular country provides for only one method of sentence enforcement, that method would be used in relation to transfers from that country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to any agreement to the contrary, I would envisage that Australia would generally use the continued enforcement method.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would involve being bound, so far as possible, by the legal nature and duration of the sentence as determined by the other country, such that a prisoner would bring with him, or her, the sentence from the sending country, minus any time served or remissions earned in the sending country, up to the date of the transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains a discretion for the Attorney-General to make any necessary adaptations to the sentence, although this is subject to the limitation that the sentence to be enforced under either method much not be harsher than the sentence originally imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the date of transfer, the sentence would be generally subject to Australia's law concerning the enforcement of sentences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The approach adopted in the bill is to treat all incoming prisoners as federal prisoners for administrative convenience and sentence enforcement purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to remember that this is not intended to affect the agreed financial obligations as between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agreement reached in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General is that the States and Territories will pay the cost of maintaining incoming prisoners in prison (unless the prisoners have community ties with Territories for which the Commonwealth is responsible).
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3231"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Application of the legislation and treaty negotiation </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, this legislation alone will not be sufficient to enable prisoners to be transferred to and from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have already mentioned, complementary legislation will need to be enacted by the participating States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, a number of administrative steps will need to be taken&mdash;for example, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General has agreed that it may be appropriate to have arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories, defining the relationship between, and the responsibilities of, the Commonwealth and the States and Territories in administering the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains a provision enabling such arrangements to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further requirement is for transfer arrangements to be entered into with other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basis of the bill is that prisoners (other than Tribunal prisoners) can only be transferred between Australia and `transfer countries'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains a mechanism by which the act is to be applied to transfer countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This involves the making of regulations, which may be based on treaty or non-treaty arrangements with other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of countries have already concluded bilateral prisoner transfer treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that some 27 countries are parties to the Council of Europe Convention, and that there are also 6 countries participating in the Commonwealth Scheme for the Transfer of Convicted Offenders (the Commonwealth Scheme).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Due to cost-effectiveness and scope, it is intended that Australia seek to become party to and implement existing multilateral arrangements such as the Council of Europe Convention and the Commonwealth Scheme, and that bilateral treaties be negotiated only with countries who are not parties to a multilateral arrangement to which Australia becomes party, and/or whose preference is for a bilateral treaty or arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial impact</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is expected to have little impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue in the short term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Expenses in relation to transfers to Australia will generally be borne by the participating States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the bill contains a clause enabling the recovery of the costs and expenses incurred in transferring prisoners.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the agreement reached in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, the Commonwealth's costs in relation to general prisoner transfers will include costs of negotiating participation in any appropriate multilateral schemes, bilateral treaties or other transfer arrangements, and the administration of receiving and making requests to other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The costs for the States and Territories will include sending escort officers, returning prisoners (including airfares) and the cost of maintaining prisoners during the terms of sentences in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost arrangements will be different in relation to transfers of Tribunal prisoners, since that responsibility arises from international relations and Australia's membership of the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will be responsible for the costs associated with transfers from the Tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost implications are however not expected to be significant in relation to Tribunal prisoners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to general prisoner transfers, there may be significant cost savings to the States and Territories if there is a net outflow of prisoners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is difficult to predict the number of prisoners likely to be moved in and out of Australia once the scheme is operating, and of course, any financial savings will depend upon the actual number of transfers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost implications are therefore unable to be precisely quantified at this stage, but will be examined as part of the agreed evaluation strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will entail a review of the legislation after the scheme has been in place for a period of 12 months to determine the extent to which it has been utilised and to assess the resource implications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.

It replaces what is a rather vague parenthood statement by the government, one which I believe bureaucrats will probably spend three to five years trying to define and fighting over, such as we saw in the national forest policy statement where similar words were used&mdash;comprehensive, adequate and representative. They took several years to define, and we do not want that to happen again. Therefore, we are looking at redefining the statement to make it a lot clearer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apart from last night when we were last debating this bill, I am not sure whether I put on the record the government's objection to this amendment. The explanation for our objection is that we believe the proposed new definition is too specific. We think it would cause problems with interpretation, and it would restrict the types of projects able to be under the initiative. The way we interpret it, unless a project can be demonstrated that it meets all four objectives, legally it would not be able to be funded, which would be against our wishes.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment (Senator Hill) discounted it: that is, it is specific. The minister says that it is too specific. As Senator Lees says, what it does is try to give direction in the spending of very limited funds on the restoration of the Murray-Darling Basin and specifically to the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know from the debate last night that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) wrote to the minister earlier this year indicating a concern that jobs creation be taken into account. Nobody is going to dispute that jobs are important, but many of us on this side of the house believe that if you are engaged in environmental excellence you will produce excellent jobs at the same time. That goes without saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The direction of this legislation and government policy has been towards environmental excellence. Senator Lees tries to tie that down with her amendment, and the minister says `I won't have it.' One can only see his consistency in that, because he is not good at having anything that ties him down to carrying out his environmental obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That said, the other point that has to be made here is that this is not a cornucopia. This is not going to fix up Australia's environment. This Telstra money is going to go a little way towards repairing some of the past damage. It is not going to do anything towards repairing the damage that is being created at the moment by the actions of this Minister for the Environment or his government. But it ought to be at least concentrated on getting maximum benefits for the environment and, in this case, specifically for the Murray-Darling Basin. Therefore, the parameters that Senator Lees points to ought to be endorsed by the committee and by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is not enough money in this whole fund to do just for the Murray-Darling Basin the specifics that Senator Lees has outlined: restoring the flow and habitat requirements of the freshwater ecosystems, enhancing efficiency and sustainability in irrigated agriculture and water storage and delivery systems, improving water quality and protecting and restoring river frontage vegetation. If the billion dollars or so over the next five years could achieve just those four aims that Sena
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3233"> tor Lees has put before the committee, I for one would be very satisfied. But it is not going to. The job is much bigger than that.

It was our objective that the $1.149 billion that we promised would be in addition to the published forecasts. That remains our objective.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we look at these amendments before us, therein lies the rub because, of course, it is not an extra amount of spending on the environment at all. This does not even address the issue of whether the trust fund moneys go to environment funding at all. That is another debate. The issue here is whether it is over and above the existing government programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill is presiding over the most extraordinary cutback in funding off the budget for environment programs that we

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the government has a plan to cut the Daintree rescue package. We could ask why the government is not prepared to provide the $4 million that Labor had budgeted for for this program in the forward estimates for the 1997-98 financial year. We could ask why the government is not even prepared to provide the $1.4 million to this program that was earmarked for the 1997-98 financial year in last year's forward estimates.

That was a commitment, I might say, that was significantly less than Labor had promised to provide in its last budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My recollection is&mdash;I did have some interest in this at the time because I was the then environment minister&mdash;that Labor had promised to allocate $3 million in 1996-97 and $3 million in 1997-98. The coalition reduced the commitment to $2 million in 1996-97 and $2 million in 1997-98 and now they are not even prepared to provide that reduced level of funding. This is what we are going to be facing up to in a few short hours, courtesy of Senator Hill and Mr Costello, in the coalition government's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also willing to make a prediction now, at 4.12 p.m., that you will scrap the highly successful, popular and effective environment program `save the bush'. This is all your own work, Senator Hill, isn't it? Why is the government not prepared to continue to provide the $3 million that has been allocated
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3235"> to this program in 1997-98 and in the 1998-99 budget?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know about the one billion trees program that you are axing, even though $7.4 million has been allocated in this program for the 1997-98 financial year. I say, as we examine this bill in the committee stage, that the one billion trees program has been incredibly successful and has been responsible for somewhere between 600 million and 700 million trees being planted across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I make is&mdash;we will know all about it in a few short hours&mdash;that I think senators and any interested members of the public that might be listening to the debate are going to see my contribution here as quite a remarkable piece of crystal ball gazing, because part of Senator Hill's budget has been leaking like a sieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can the government sustain their argument that they will be spending over $1 billion extra on the environment in the light of these absolutely outrageous cuts to the environment that are going to have a very significant impact on the quality of our environment and our commitment to environmental protection in this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill, you really should be ashamed of yourself in relation to these issues. It is a massive breach of faith with the electorate. You have not delivered in any sense. I think we are entitled to be very concerned about the most recent change in focus that has been announced by the government in relation to the Natural Heritage Trust Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept the importance of some of the imperatives that I hope are shared by you and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). That is why I am trying to understand fully what the government's intention is in relation to the role of the employment committee of cabinet and its interrelationship with your and Minister Anderson's work as the board of the trust fund. I appreciate the fact that you have indicated that you may well table the Prime Minister's communication so that many of us in the Senate can be let into the secret.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have acknowledged that we are spreading the funding a little in relation to those. That was very sensible because the first purchases in relation to the glider were largely of land.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is only one alternative to that and that is that money would be spent on projects that injure the ecological attributes of the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin. If it is not ecologically sustainable, it must be ecologically damaging. But we have got the Minister for the Environment saying, `No, I don't want that word there. It might cause some restriction in the way in which I and the minister for agriculture spend money for the environment.' He adds to that&mdash;and he says this with an equal&hyphen;handed tone in his voice, if you will forgive the mixed metaphor&mdash;`We have got to also look at economic sustainability,' as if the two things are incompatible. That is not the case and what we cannot close our eyes to in this committee is that the minister has, for himself, in the terms of this legislation, written in the ability for the government to spend money on projects that are not ecologically sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the short and long of it. If ecological sustainability, as a minimum, is to be a condition of this money being spent, then he would agree to it. `Ecologically enhancing' ought to be the term that is put here&mdash;not just sustaining but enhancing&mdash;because we are trying to repair the damage that has been done by past malpractice to this greatest of Australia's river basins.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a very important amendment. It is the most important direction for improvement of the bill that the Greens will be taking. The situation under the legislation as it stands is that the allocation of funds is in the care and determination of a board. When you look at that board you find that it is none other than the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. It is really not a board as the public expects these things to be at all. It is two ministers taking to themselves total power for the disbursement of this $1&frac14; billion for the Natural Heritage Trust Fund over the next five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens believe that there should be expertise brought into this. This nation has a great level of environmental expertise, particularly amongst professionals who understand the damage of the past and who are working prodigiously to find means to repair that damage and to get the country's environment back on track&mdash;whether that be the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3247"> Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin about which we have just been speaking, our forests, our rangelands, our coasts or any other component of the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To that end, this amendment is to establish a board which has a specific make&hyphen;up of nine people with expertise in the following areas: biodiversity; marine conservation; wilderness conservation; world heritage; arid lands; soil conservation; inland waters; indigenous people's heritage; and community consultation. The government or other members of the committee may argue that there are other areas which ought to be covered. But we have framed this amendment carefully to cover a range of areas which is going to be more than adequate for the modest amount of money to be spent on the environment out of this fund over the next five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is very important about this matter is that it will bring in Australian experts in the environment and in community consultation to ensure that the maximum value comes out of every dollar of this $1&frac14; billion. We know that it is not enough money to do more than make a very tiny start on the road to repairing Australia's environment. That is a key reason why we should be making sure that it has maximum impact for the benefit of that environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a previous amendment, which was rejected by the committee, we did not lay out the areas in which board members should have expertise. We have also expanded the size of the board under this amendment. The minister, however, as with boards set up for other instrumentalities, is the appointing person. The ministers will be able to appoint the people with this expertise. The amendment requires that the experts will have relevant postgraduate qualifications or at least five years significant work experience; and that there be a chairperson who, while not necessarily having the expertise that is listed for the nine specific members, has an established interest and demonstrated concern in environmental matters. The members of the board, including the chair, will hold office on a part&hyphen;time basis; and they will have similar terms and conditions in their appointment as
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> do members of other boards such as the Australia Council, the CSIRO and the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not forget that, while $1&frac14; billion might seem modest in terms of the job ahead, it is a very big amount of public funds; and it needs to be under very expert direction. In putting forward the amendment, we draw from the experience gained in spending large amounts of public money on other bodies such as the Australia Council or the CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot believe that the government expects the people to feel fully comfortable with two ministers administering these funds. The reality is that people will expect that the ministers are going to come under sectional pressures. We know that environmental interests are at a very great disadvantage compared with economic interests in determining government outcomes in this country. They do not have the public relations millions; they do not have the expert lobbyists; they do not have the power of persuasion over governments simply because they do not have the money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that situation, I would have thought that the government would welcome this amendment. It is simply going to shield the ministers from future accusations by people who lose out in their applications for money. The two ministers will be able to say, `Here's a recommendation from this panel of national experts.' As it is, the two ministers leave themselves open to accusations of bias, of political or sheer economic considerations being taken into account from anybody who fails to get funding from the Natural Heritage Trust Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a really sensible amendment which is pivotal to the reputation of this project. It is enhancing the public good feeling about this money being spent on the environment and it is specifically going to free the ministers to take advice from the best brains and the most experienced people in the country. They will be able to feel confident that they are making the best decisions; and that they are not subject to considerations such as pressure from sources, from within and outside the government, for non&hyphen;environmental considerations to be taken into account.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3248">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there it is. I recommend the amendment to the committee. It is fundamental to the way in which the public is going to determine whether or not it has faith in the process of spending this money. It is extremely good practice for the government not to allow itself to be seen to be making political decisions in spending this money. It ensures that the government is seen to be drawing on environmental expertise, second to none, in making these important decisions.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised that this amendment is being allowed. It is basically repeating an amendment that was defeated during the previous consideration of this bill by the committee. On that occasion, Senator Brown attempted to set up a committee that would assume the responsibility for disbursement of funds under this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than shield ministers in the way put by Senator Brown, we believe that ministers should accept responsibility for the expenditure of public funds and take the consequences for that. The safeguards lie within the mechanisms for developing the programs and the partnership agreements that will be entered into with the states, and then the annual reports and other accountability provisions that are contained in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate is exactly the same as the one we had on the last occasion. It is principally the same amendment that Senator Brown advanced on the last occasion and upon which he was defeated. He has changed the composition of the board, but the objective of his amendment is exactly the same. I did not know that you could come back with repeat amendments&mdash;amendments substantially in the same form as those that have been defeated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the same reasons as I advanced on the last occasion, we will continue to oppose this. As I have said, we have put in place the mechanisms to ensure that the funds are properly disbursed&mdash;mechanisms that allow for a very wide contribution to the development of the programs through the regional assessment panels and the state assessment panels; through advisory bodies, such as the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> National Landcare Advisory Committee, the Biological Diversity Advisory Committee, the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin Community Advisory Council, the Endangered Species Advisory Committee, and the Council for Sustainable Vegetation Management which is soon to be formed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Hill indicated, the Senate has already debated an amendment proposing an independent board to administer the trust fund. The opposition did strongly support the establishment of such a board basically because it would limit the capacity of the trust fund to be used as a political slush fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Hill's `criticism', if you like, that this amendment is similar to the one that we had dealt with earlier, which was defeated, is probably accurate, or that his assessment that that is the case is probably pretty true. But the new amendment that is before us increases the size of the board to nine members and places requirements on the members of the board to have certain expertise. The opposition, in fact, preferred the constitution of the earlier board. We do remain committed to the principle of the need to establish an independent board. It is for those reasons that the opposition will be supporting the amendment that Senator Brown is proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think you can really stress enough how important it is for this trust to be managed properly. Without an independent board, the trust will be the biggest discretionary fund ever established which can be distributed at the whim of two ministers. The accountability mechanisms in this bill, as far as the opposition is concerned, are almost non-existent. That is obviously a major concern to us, and we believe that an independent board would go some way to addressing that concern. We believe that an independent board would go some way to ensuring that environmental priorities&mdash;not political priorities&mdash;are a

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Hill has said, there are state advisory committees and there will be a number of other committees through which all of these matters, or a number of them, will be canvassed.

Of course we would. That is in the hands of every member of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, I do not agree with a number of the statutory boards.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine may feel that we in this Senate are in a better position to influence what our fellow politicians do or do not do in making political decisions, but we ought to also think about the wider public. They generally have greater faith in boards made up of representatives from their own ranks than they do in this sort of sham board&mdash;because that is what it is&mdash;which consists of two ministers. It is not a board as the public reads the meaning of the word. It is simply two ministers making up their minds on a whole range of political as well as other considerations. Let us not put our heads in the sand, because that is what will happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine says that people can complain about that when they are cut out and when the decisions have not been made on purely environmental grounds.

At the Tasmanian level, instead of an advisory board being set up for the use of these environmental funds in the department of the environment, which includes national parks, it is being set up in the Premier's own office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of the board being made up from environmentalists in Tasmania&mdash;and there are plenty of those with extraordinarily high qualifications&mdash;it has been made up of two folk who do not have particular environmental expertise. The whole record of the person in charge has been to set his face against the environment movement in Tasmania. His record has been to fight against the proper establishment of world heritage protection for Tasmania's forests, including its rainforests and its tall eucalypt forests, over the last 15 years or so of moves by the community to protect what is left of Tasmania's grand forests. That includes world heritage forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am completely stonkered by the minister's ability to believe those who are concerned for the nation's environment can get any comfort at all from the way in which the administration of these funds is being established. The government, with the pivotal assistance of Senator Harradine, is turning down this sensible move to establish an independent
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> panel of environmental experts to ensure that this money is spent in the best way possible. The government wants to leave it in the hands of two ministers whose record on the environment is abysmal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is excusing itself by saying, `Further down the line we will be getting good advice.' I challenged the minister to come forward with the bona fides of those people who are giving that primary advice in Tasmania, and he was silent on it. As I have explained to this committee, those people do not have the expertise to enable the environmentally concerned people in Tasmania to have any faith at all. In fact, it is quite the reverse. There is enormous alarm and shrugging of shoulders in despair in Tasmania about the people who are being put in charge of the disbursement of these funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of peak community groups in Tasmania feel that they are cut out. They do not understand the process. It is closed as far as initial applications are concerned. There are all sorts of provisos in their way, and the feeling is already being built up that those in the know will get those funds. Those who know how to work the reins of power and who have the lines to power will do better than those who do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a totally unsatisfactory situation. I reiterate that we are speaking about a billion and a quarter dollars of the Australian people's money. We are speaking about a special opportunity to do good things for the environment. We are speaking about an obligation on the government and on Senator Harradine, who has now said that he had a role in helping formulate the legislation we are dealing with, and we know that he had a prodigious lobbying role in terms of this legislation and in ensuring that the part sale of Telstra went through this place. The government and Senator Harradine are saying no to this extraordinarily important improvement on this legislation. I believe that situation is totally unsatisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is reprehensible that environmental expertise is not in the pivotal positions where the decisions are going to be made. We are going to live to see a great deal of unnecessary animosity and public dissatisfaction with
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3251"> what should be a matter of great public faith and optimism as far as addressing the enormous concern there is in Australia for environmental excellence and improvement in the years ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would once again appeal to Senator Harradine, in particular, who is pivotal in the numbers in this place if we are going to see this sort of amendment get up, to consider again the need for environmental experts to be put in the key positions of deciding where this money should go and not just leaving it to the ministers, who have neither the environmental expertise nor the record which would give confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me finally say that the best half, if you like, of the authority in disbursing these funds is going to be vested in the Minister for the Environment. But here we have a Minister for the Environment who, in his short 12 months in office, has licensed the record destruction of what is left of Australia's wild forests and wildlife through licensing woodchip operations to an unprecedented level in the forested states of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, during question time we heard him dismissing the concerns that Senator Margetts had that he was riding over advice from the Australian Heritage Commission which would have protected the Giblett block in Western Australia where demonstrators right now are trying to prevent the bulldozers and chainsaws from moving in on magnificent ancient forest which, if this Minister for the Environment has his way, is going to be cut down and sent to the woodchip mills and to the processors in the Northern Hemisphere. It is a minister who is in favour of increased uranium mining and, therefore, the enhancement of the dangerous nuclear industry and nuclear cycle in the rest of the world. It is a minister who has failed and made Australia the only country in the Southern Hemisphere not to object to the transport of extraordinarily dangerous nuclear waste cargoes through our waters on the way from reprocessing in France to storage in Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a minister who has given the tick to the extremely damaging Hinchinbrook tourist resort at the conjunction of the two world heritage areas at Hinchinbrook in Queensland.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It is a minister who is advocating that Australia be seen as the recalcitrant as far as global warming responsibilities are concerned when it comes to the international conference at Kyoto at the end of this year where Australia's environmental record is going to take another hammering so that the position we had in the 1980s of being at the front of the community of nations in advancing the interests of the environment is lost and frittered away to one where we become internationally regarded as holding back in the traces when it comes to our responsibilities, and so on and so on and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would rather that we brought in Australia's environmental experts and saw that this money was put to the very best use. Apparently we are not going to see that because the government and Senator Harradine do not want this committee. Well, they have got the numbers. It could be said, `Be that on their heads.' But that is not good enough as far as responsibility to the Australian public is concerned. That is not good enough as far as the use of an enormous amount of public funds belonging to the Australian people is concerned. Above all, that is not good enough for meeting the aspirations of a very environmentally alert Australian public towards the future environmental health of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole matter of the Natural Heritage Trust Fund has become second rate. Senator Faulkner said that it is moving towards the reality of a slush fund. Those are very strong terms indeed, but there has been nothing in this part of the debate, either from the minister or from Senator Harradine, which would give confidence that that is not going to be the case.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I do not know where to start. There would not have been one red cent in the Natural Heritage Trust Fund if Senator Brown had had his way&mdash;not a cent. Over a billion dollars has been put into the Natural Heritage Trust Fund, and not by anything that Senator Brown has said. He said words to the effect that the system is totally unsatisfactory. Is it unsatisfactory to have over a billion dollars put into the Natural Heritage Trust
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3252"> Fund? Is it, Senator Brown? You had nothing to do with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am happy to say that, when it became absolutely clear that there was no way out of the one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra, I did go to the government and ask them what it was all about. They indicated that it was about getting money, some of which was to go to the redemption of debt and other parts of which were to go to the Natural Heritage Trust Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose Senator Brown is sorry that Tasmania got more than its fair share, if you are looking at the number of people in Tasmania. I do not think we got more than our fair share. I know that we would not have got anywhere near 10 per cent had that not been a matter of great moment to me and had not the negotiations borne that out. That it why it is now not a particular figure but it is 10 per cent of the Natural Heritage Trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not one cent would have gone into that trust fund if Senator Brown had had anything to do with it. What is he belly&hyphen;aching for here now? He is talking about the system being totally unsatisfactory. He is talking about a whole range of areas that frankly have nothing to do with the case in hand. What we are talking about here is accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To be quite frank, a body such as that Senator Brown is proposing is not the body that should be accountable. It is the politicians that should be accountable. It is the Minister for the Environment, who is at the table, who should be accountable. If there is some problem, if there are a number of groups that feel cut out, then those groups have the opportunity through their organisations, directly with the ministers and through their members of parliament, to have the matters taken up and to have all of the questions relating to disbursement of the funds examined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I tell you what: those disbursements will be examined and examined and examined, particularly if the disbursements are the responsibility ultimately of the two ministers. That is how it ought to be. The two ministers ought to be receiving the advice of the various groups in the states and they are the ones
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who should make the final decisions in accordance with the legislation before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to canvass any further the matters that were canvassed last time. I feel that this legislation should get a pretty swift passage and we then should get on with the job of making the disbursements as soon as possible from the fund that is established under this measure.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine wants a swift passage of this legislation. It is the first time I have heard it. This legislation has been hanging back for months. As Senator Lees said earlier, it is quite surprising that it has taken so long to get here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine says that there would not be a red cent as far as I was concerned. There would be a whole different environmental set&hyphen;up in this country if I were in the position to make this happen. For example, instead of sitting on the side, as Senator Harradine has done, we would have protection of our wild forests. We would not have a woodchip industry marauding through those forests, shedding jobs as it goes, particularly in Tasmania, where it includes the destruction of world heritage forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also would be looking at alternatives, which include proper greenhouse gas controls and a carbon levy, as is the case in many other more enlightened countries in the Northern Hemisphere. We would have proper biodiversity protection in this country, we would have proper public transport, with the emphasis going away from the polluting transport systems we have got at the moment, and a whole range of other things that Senator Harradine has, if you ask me, been remiss in promoting in this place in his 21 years here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, on issue after issue, from the Franklin River through to the great issues of the forests and Wesley Vale in Tasmania, I cannot remember Senator Harradine taking any outspoken point of view in favour of the environment. If Senator Harradine equates money with the environment, he has got it wrong. Sure, it helps. This is a repair package for damage done in the past by the failure of politicians like, I submit, Senator Harradine to stand up when they had the opportunity
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3253"> years ago to protect the environment as the damage expanded and increased, even while platitudes were being spoken about the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, that is the case at the moment. Here we have Senator Harradine backing this minister, putting forward his stamp of approval on this minister and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. They, as I have said earlier, take pivotal responsibility for the record rate of destruction of forests and wildlife going on in this country at the moment&mdash;as opposed to putting it across to a panel of environmental experts. So much for Senator Harradine's commitment or, might I say, his knowledge about proper mechanisms for looking after the environmental interests of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not quite understand that or why this advisory committee's functions are restricted to advising about the integration of those matters rather than those matters themselves. I would have thought that advice on environmental protection, natural resources management and sustainable agriculture&mdash;rather than advice on how to integrate those three things&mdash;would be much better and much more worth while for the ministers involved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the opposition's view, the arrangement that Senator Lees has come to with the government to establish an advisory committee does not remove the real potential for money provided to the trust being allocated on the basis of political and not environmental need. So I do think this is rather a token amendment. It does not address the underlying problem because, once established, this trust fund will be, as I have said before, the biggest discretionary fund in the hands of two ministers in Australia's history. I do not believe it is adequate to address this issue with the establishment of an advisory committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To remove the potential for massive pork-barrelling and to improve the accountability of the trust, the opposition obviously preferred the establishment of a stronger, more independent board which set criteria for distributing the funds. I think, unfortunately for the future of the trust, the proposal for an independent board has been defeated&mdash;now on two occasions. So it is in the absence of success for those amendments that the opposition supports the establishment of an advisory board and hence supports this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to remember that the Senate committee report recommended the establishment of an advisory board. The committee actually reported that there was significant community concern raised during the public hearings and in individual submissions about the lack of accountability and the need for greater transparency in the current two-minister board. There was obviously also significant support for the board to be representative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is probably reasonable to say that the establishment of an advisory board com
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> posed of relevant interest groups and experts goes some way to achieving these aims. The advisory committee will provide some degree of openness in the decision making process but, in our view, not enough. I do think this particular committee represents only a token concession by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as we are concerned, the trust still remains a slush fund that can be divided up at the political whim of the two controlling ministers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Treasurer is delivering in another place his Budget Speech for 1997&hyphen;98.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In last year's Budget, delivered less than nine months ago, this Government laid out a plan to turn around our nation's finances and secure our future. Our country had been on a losing strategy&mdash;a path of deficit and debt to the next century.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So we took a look at that problem&mdash;not one of our making&mdash;we faced it and we determined to fix it. You can't fix years of neglect overnight. But our Government laid out its strategy and got on with the job.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Tonight the Treasurer will report that we have made very significant progress.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And tonight the Treasurer will announce measures to consolidate and extend that progress, measures which can secure our objective to put the Commonwealth budget into surplus in this our first term of Government. Our consolidated measures turned around a $10.3 billion Labor deficit in 1995&hyphen;96 and they lay out a path to a $1.6 billion Coalition surplus over three years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Whilst the former Government was running up deficit and debts our prospects were getting bleaker. Our future choices were getting narrower and harder. But paying our way, and then reducing our debt, means our prospects are getting brighter and our opportunities greater.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the forthcoming year the Commonwealth has no borrowing requirement. In fact for the first time in nearly a decade, this year the Commonwealth will not run up debt. In the coming financial year we will repay it. We will repay over $5 billion of debt.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Government's one third Telstra privatisation is not being done to balance the books. Aside from establishing the Natural Heritage
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Trust that money is going to retire debt. That money will free future Australians from debt and the debt servicing costs that threatened to choke them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">From the time we came to office to 2000&hyphen;01 the Commonwealth's net debt to GDP ratio will almost halve on current forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Madam President, for the second time in a row, the Treasurer will announce that this will be done with no increase in income tax rates, no increase in the company tax rate, no increase in the wholesale sales tax, no lift in the petrol excise. In fact, for the second Budget in a row, tonight the Treasurer will announce tax reductions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Government's programme of budget repair is being accomplished on the expenditure side. From our coming to office to the turn of the decade, underlying outlays are projected to fall from 27 per cent of GDP to just under 23 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This year's Budget papers provide unprecedented information on our fiscal strategy and economic outlook. It is the first Budget to be prepared in accordance with the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When enacted, that Charter will require all future governments to match the standards of integrity in financial reporting that we are setting today.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">ENCOURAGING PRIVATE SAVING</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Madam President, increasing savings will bring important economic benefits for Australia. It will reduce our reliance on foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">With more saving we can finance more of our investment to grow the economy faster and produce jobs. Higher savings will raise the speed limits to growth that have held us back over the past decade.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Treasurer has outlined the way in which the Government will move from borrowing to saving in the first term of the Howard
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3258"> Government. And now is the time to encourage individuals to save as well.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Tonight the Treasurer will announce the Government's plan to reduce the tax on saving.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Every Australian will be eligible for a 15 per cent tax rebate on their savings. The measure will be introduced in two stages with a 7.5 per cent rebate from 1 July 1998 and the full rebate from 1 July 1999.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The rebate will apply to the first $3,000 of taxable income from savings however derived. For example, the rebate would apply to the whole of the interest earned on $60,000 invested at 5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Alternatively, the rebate can be claimed in respect of any payment of personal contributions into superannuation up to $3,000. A person who pays $3,000 into superannuation will get a $450 tax rebate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The 15 per cent rebate applies to the marginal tax rate. For a person on the 20 per cent tax rate it will mean the income they put into superannuation is taxed at just 5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Madam President, the savings rebate will benefit around 6 million taxpayers. The bulk of the benefit will flow to individuals with taxable income under $40,000. It will benefit current savers and encourage new savers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is a significant encouragement to save in the form of superannuation, but it also provides assistance for individuals who are saving for other life cycle purposes such as education, health care, housing, and retirement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The savings rebate takes the place of Labor's L&hyphen;A&hyphen;W tax cuts which were never paid. This brings to an end a tawdry episode. Other Labor schemes to deduct contributions from take home pay and make Government payments into superannuation couldn't have worked. And they were discriminatory&mdash;to one class of saving (superannuation)&mdash;and to one class of society (those in the workforce).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Coalition approach is universal&mdash;open to all Australians and all types of saving. In particular, older Australians who have saved for their retirement are brought in from the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cold and given the chance to take up the savings rebate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It will equally benefit individuals who have used their savings to build up a business and subsequently derive a return on that business.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The savings rebate is estimated to cost $350 million in 1998&hyphen;99 and $1.4 billion in 1999&hyphen;2000.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This measure will provide a saving of $1 billion against the forward estimates in that year over the cost of the previous proposals for Government superannuation payments.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">SUPERANNUATION AND RETIREMENT INCOMES</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Government is also announcing tonight a number of other major measures to improve the operation of our superannuation and retirement income system. These are designed to promote savings, choice, and incentive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Superannuation Preservation Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Madam President, the Government considers it important to ensure that savings through superannuation are directed to their intended purpose&mdash;providing income in retirement. It is for this reason that superannuation is given concessional tax treatment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have therefore decided to introduce a number of improvements to the preservation arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The preservation rules will be amended from 1 July 1999 to ensure that all future superannuation contributions, including personal contributions, and earnings, will be preserved until preservation age, except in limited circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Benefits which are unpreserved at that date will remain so.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As indicated prior to the election, the Government will proceed with a phased increase in the preservation age from 55 to 60 by the year 2025. This proposal was first announced by the former Government in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For someone born before July 1960 the preservation age will remain at 55 years, while for someone born after 30 June 1964 the preservation age will be 60.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Revenue Measures</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This Budget continues the Government's commitment to reducing tax compliance costs for small business.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In March this year, the Prime Minister announced the Government's response to the recommendations of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force. That response included a number of taxation measures designed to assist small business. It built on measures to free small business from capital gains tax on rollover of assets or business. It provides a record keeping exemption available to up to half of small businesses paying fringe benefits tax.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Tonight, the Treasurer is pleased to announce changes to withholding tax arrangements to further reduce tax compliance costs for small business and reduce the frequency of transactions between business and the Australian Taxation Office. From 1 July 1998, businesses with an annual tax withholding obligation of $25,000 or less, under the Pay&hyphen;As&hyphen; You&hyphen;Earn, Prescribed Payments and Reportable Payments systems, will have the option to remit these payments on a quarterly, rather than a monthly, basis. This measure will allow in excess of 300,000 small businesses the opportunity to defer the remittance of $500 million in withheld amounts in 1998&hyphen;99.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In addition, and in step with commercial trends, payments by large withholders (that is, those with annual withholding obligation in excess of $1 million) are to be made earlier and by electronic means. The revenue bring forward from this change will offset the revenue deferral costs associated with the new arrangements for small business and provide a one&hyphen;off gain in 1998&hyphen;99.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Treasurer is announcing tonight a range of further measures to enhance tax system integrity. These are not measures to increase revenue but are designed to guard against the potential erosion of revenue in the future. For example, the Treasurer is announcing measures to protect the integrity of the company
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tax imputation system, to deal with dividend streaming and franking credit trading.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Treasurer is also announcing tonight the Government has responded to submissions from small business and will ensure legislation dealing with use of trust losses does not adversely affect closely held family trusts utilising losses in the family group. However, it is now clear that the taxation of trusts must be considered more generally and the Government will release a discussion paper on this issue later this year setting out issues and possible ways of approaching them.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Underlying inflation is expected to remain low&mdash;at only 2 per cent through the year to June 1998.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 8 per cent over the course of 1997&hyphen;98 as employment growth accelerates.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I begin my adjournment speech tonight, I draw to the attention of the chamber the absence of the Greens and all of the Democrats during the budget speech tonight. It is a great disappointment that they were not here tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise to speak tonight on the issue of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge, which was the focus of legislation passed in this place last night. Sadly it seems that this will still not be the end of the matter since we have learned today that a High Court challenge is still to be pursued. In South Australia, therefore, it
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> seems that we are still looking at a bridge too far away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an issue which has caused substantial division in my state and a good deal of personal anxiety within the communities of South Australia. Surely it was time this matter was resolved last night once and for all, not only for the federal and state governments but also for the wider community and, most importantly, for the Ngarrindjeri women themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the very great privilege last year to meet three members of the Ngarrindjeri community&mdash;three of the so-called dissident women&mdash;when Dorothy, Dulcie and Jenny visited Canberra late last year to take part in the launch of a book which reveals the truth of this very sad matter. The so-called bridge debate has gone on in South Australia for over three years and has cost more than $4 million, taking into account the cost of the two state and two federal inquiries and associated legal actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three of the inquiries found that the bridge should go ahead. The other was effectively overturned on appeal. Moreover, without this legislation, another report&mdash;the fifth&mdash;may have been needed. What a travesty and what a terrible waste of money. Given the history of litigation surrounding this issue, there is no guarantee that another report would lead to a finalisation of the matter without yesterday's legislation. What a truly amazing saga for a stretch of water that the fitter members of this place could swim across with ease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government is guilty of gross mismanagement and incompetence on this matter. The issue of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge has raised questions about the ability of governments to deal sensibly with indigenous heritage issues. Quite clearly, the time had come for the debate over the bridge to be ended once and for all. This was clearly an exceptional case. The use of the legislation that was passed last night is a crucial step in this very important process, not only for South Australia but for those courageous dissident women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether or not the area on which the Hindmarsh Island Bridge will be built is a sacred site depends crucially on the veracity
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3264"> of the so&hyphen;called `secret women's business'. The royal commission found that this claim was a fabrication, a recent invention. Four reports have now been prepared into the Hindmarsh Island Bridge and only one supported the evidence of the secret women's business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report, by Professor Cheryl Saunders, was quashed by the Federal Court. Moreover, it was clear that her report was fundamentally flawed. For example, it appears that she never once visited the South Australian Museum, which holds considerable knowledge on these sorts of matters. Justice Matthews, in the most recent report on the matter, found that there was insufficient evidence to indicate that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge area was in fact a sacred site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts totally discredited the main proponent of the secret women's business, Doreen Kartinyeri. In the process of her very public and damaging campaign, which has cost a great deal of money, a handful of very courageous indigenous women found the strength to speak out and to tell the truth about this very important issue. They have endured many months of personal torture and have been ostracised by their communities. During their visit to Canberra, one of them told me that she does not expect to be reconciled with the community in her lifetime. What a tragedy this is for those women and for all South Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor, at last, sensibly agreed last night, by its support for the government's position, that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge saga should be brought to an end and that the bridge should be allowed to go ahead. So I am puzzled as to why the opposition spokesperson on justice was absent from the final vote on the bill last night, having said during the debate that he actually supported it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also puzzling and, I must say, disappointing to learn that Mrs Kartinyeri has announced, through her lawyer, that she intends to launch a High Court action against last night's Hindmarsh Island Bridge legislation. It is almost unbelievable to South Australians that, once again, we have to go through another divisive community debate on this issue. Just when all South Australians
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thought that they could breathe a sigh of relief that the final chapter of this unfortunate saga had been written, we find that even more money, time and community division is to be expended on a bridge that sadly still seems to be too far away.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="3264"><TITLE>University Enrolments</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I begin my adjournment speech on the issue of education and university enrolments, I would like to acknowledge the comments by Senator Ferris regarding the absence of the Australian Democrats from the chamber during the budget speech. I only wish that I had the luxury of being able to sit in this chamber and listen to the budget being handed down, as opposed to having to juggle responses to at least seven portfolios, unlike Senator Ferris. So I think that explains the absence of my colleagues and me. But we did watch the broadcast of the budget being handed down and we gave it the attention it deserved, as you will no doubt see over the next few hours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, I was misrepresented in the chamber by two senators&mdash;the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, and Senator Eric Abetz in a question that he posed to the minister. He claimed I had stated that enrolments for universities had declined. In fact, what I stated all along has been that enrolment applications have declined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also correct in that assumption and that claim. Indeed, Senator Abetz referred to a press release of 7 February, which I tabled earlier today, in which I discussed the minister's own department's findings&mdash;that is, that enrolment applications had declined across the nation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very clear distinction between enrolments and enrolment applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to put on record the total number of university enrolment applications that had declined at that time. In Queensland, they were down by three per cent; in Western Australia, they were down by five per cent; in Victoria, there was a decline of six per cent; in New South Wales, six per cent also; in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3265"> South Australia, seven per cent; and eight per cent in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truly terrible statistics were in relation to applications for enrolment by mature age students. They had declined by 12 per cent in South Australia, 13 per cent in Victoria, 15 per cent in Tasmania, 17 per cent in Western Australia and 19 per cent in New South Wales. It is a very clear and important distinction that if you are a commentator in the higher education debate, you cannot afford to confuse. For that reason, I am absolutely astounded that the minister made that mistake. I can only question whether or not she made that confusion deliberately, in a blatant attempt to demonstrate that her higher education reforms, unprecedented and regressive as they are, have not had the negative impact that they indeed have had, or whether or not it was an ignorant claim by the minister and<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Eric Abetz in an attempt to point score.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also took offence at the personal reflections made by the minister in this place. She may think it is funny to refer to hair colour, hair care or the appearance of Democrat senators, but I suggest it is rather a double standard, considering the debate that raged around the comments of a rather, shall we say, flustered backbencher, the member for Lindsay, Ms Jackie Kelly, in a debate at the Tertiary Presidents' Conference. At that debate, it was made very clear that comments, personal reflections, on the appearance of women in this place are inappropriate. I suggest that the minister and her colleagues should also stick to commenting on policies and record and not on the appearance of people in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister also made comments today about overseas students. I believe she accused me of claiming that the overseas student market would be hit as a consequence of the higher education changes. Indeed, we are led to understand that there has been a dampening and a decline in overseas student enrolment applications. Unfortunately, some institutions have not released those figures, but I am sure that the government knows what is going on and I look forward to seeing some kind of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tabling or provision of information by the minister's own department in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press </EMPHASIS>on the weekend the minister made clear that she thought that there had been some impact on campuses as a result of the race debate inspired, perhaps, by the discussions of the member for Oxley (Mrs Hanson). Certainly, surveys from universities, such as the University of South Australia, demonstrate that those students who have come here from different countries&mdash;international students&mdash;are concerned about not only the quality of higher education in this country and the impact of the changes that took place in last year's budget but also their safety on campuses. I am not making that up. There are surveys to prove it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A press release from the Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee of 6 May was headed `Vice&hyphen;Chancellors: new overseas promotions agency would help counter negative impact of Hanson'. Given that the minister affords more credibility to the comments of the AVCC than certainly to me or my colleagues' comments in this area, perhaps she would read that press release and take note of their concerns about the comments of the member for Oxley regarding students from different countries or race relations in general. They believe that there is a problem. Given that our export education market in this country makes more money for this country than do wheat exports, the minister should certainly be paying attention to their concerns and recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister also implied that we argued that departments would be harshly hit by the budget measures. Indeed, they have been. I thought it was ironic that the minister gave a speech at the graduation, that is, the commemoration ceremony, of law and performing arts students of the University of Adelaide. Never mind the fact that law students are now going to be hit with the highest HECS charge, and that the performing arts faculty from that campus has now closed as a consequence of the minister's education changes. They were some of the last graduates who will be leaving that campus. I am sure they were thrilled to have the minister addressing their commemoration ceremony. Perhaps that is why they were wearing black armbands.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3266">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has asked me for an apology for allegedly misleading the community by claiming that enrolments were down. That is not what I said; I said enrolment applications were down and I supported that with evidence from the minister's department provided at estimates when I questioned the minister on this in February and since then. So I, in fact, asked the minister for an apology. As I made clear, she may be used to making mistakes in her portfolio, she may be used to blunders like the actual means test debacle, and she may be unconcerned about mistakes like the so&hyphen;called `Wright family' when discussing issues such as Austudy, but the Democrats do not like making errors, and will admit when we make them, but in this area we have not made an error. So how dare the minister ask me or any other of my colleagues to make an apology that is not due?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to the minister coming into this place, preferably tomorrow&mdash;and I would not mind if Senator Abetz came in too&mdash;to apologise for misleading this parliament and for misleading the community on a broadcast day, and also to make clear that enrolment applications have declined. Enrolments remain stable, and no&hyphen;one is denying that. Demand has been up for some years, anyway, so it is not surprising that they remain stable. But enrolment applications have declined. And that is where you determine whether those who have been turned off, be they students already or student aspirants, have been turned off university or higher education as a consequence of regressive measures such as up-front full cost fees or HECS hikes.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="8.19 p.m." PAGE="3266"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 8.19 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>

After consideration of the application of the secrecy provisions of the National Health Act 1953 to the Allars Inquiry documents, an agreement was reached between the legal firm, Rennick Briggs, acting on the behalf of the majority of the plaintiffs and the Australian Government Solicitor as to the provision of a large of number of Allars Inquiry documents to those lawyers. This agreed procedure has been in place for some time. I am advised by the Australian Government Solicitor that in terms of the request for Allars materials by lawyers for the plaintiffs, Rennick Briggs, there are presently no further documents being sought.</PARA>
