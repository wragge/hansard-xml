<PARA STYLE="Para">These government amendments to the customs and excise bill address the concerns that were expressed that the record keeping provisions in the bill could be construed as prescriptive requiring the keeping of logbooks and operating records. I might point out that this was never the government's position and its amendments clarify the proposed requirements to keep the diesel fuel records by removing any suggestions that particular types of records have to be kept. In fact, the amendment refers to the fact that it is simply in relation to the actual nature of the use of the diesel fuel itself.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.36 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will support government amendments Nos 1 and 2. We do so reluctantly. We think the next set of amendments that is to be moved by the opposition is far superior and will improve the position immeasurably. But the reason why we support these amendments is they make what is essentially a stupid position a bit better, and because that is an incremental benefit, a small change to the good, we will support them but hope that we can win the confidence of the committee for our more complete restoration of sanity with the amendments that I will move following this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments are about record keeping, as the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) has said. The Senate, as I have repeatedly said in this debate, conducted an inquiry into this legislation. The National Farmers Federation came and gave compelling evidence to that inquiry about the complicated nature of record keeping that would be required by the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a move, as I understand it, by the government to clarify and make more simple the onerous red tape the government's original bill would have imposed on farmers in Australia. I might say, there is still an amount of complexity here. That amount of complexity flies directly in the face of the very solemn election promise given by the government at the last election&mdash;that they would cut down the level of red tape on small business. Farmers run a small business and the level of red tape being imposed here is quite high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the big unknown about these amendments and the reason I wish to make a few brief remarks on them is that what the government has said consistently is that one has to read the final bill when it becomes the act in order to see what the legal obligations are. But there will be a set of guidelines to the act issued by the government which will explain how people should go about complying with the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is hard to understand what the government has absolutely clear in its mind until one sees that memorandum. That memorandum is still secret; it has not been published. This bill is a bill that arises from the 1996-97 budget&mdash;
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">the budget of one year ago. I would have thought by now, given the extensive consultation the government has had with industry, they would have got around to publishing the memorandum. The fact that they have not published the memorandum does not do anything to shed any clarity on this proposal. Perhaps the minister, if he chooses to reply in this debate, might say when the government will be publishing that memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The detail here is that the claimants&mdash;that is, the farmers in this case&mdash;will still be required to provide records that could only be obtained through the use of logbooks. They will be required, in essence, whether the government wishes to assert it or not, to maintain a logbook for the purposes of settling the argument as to what amount of diesel fuel was used on which particular item of farm equipment and for what purpose it was used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think these amendments, as I have said, are somewhat hollow and pointless. The sole purpose appears simply to release the government from the charge that they are adding red tape to farmers and other small business claimants by not having to keep logbooks in their tractors. The additional supplementary explanatory memorandum tabled with these amendments says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inclusion in the original Bill of the reference to log books and other specific operating records in relation to the actual nature of the fuel used was intended to be an example of the type of record that might be kept.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The original clause does not read much like an example at all; it reads more like a veiled threat. But if the government's word is to be taken and accepted and it is just an example, then what these amendments do is remove that example from the bill. I do not think that that is a substantive change. The explanatory memorandum goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If an applicant has other records which record the actual nature of the use of fuel, those records will be sufficient . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The onus is on the user of the diesel fuel to keep such records as are necessary to demonstrate that the actual use of the diesel fuel was in an eligible activity.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4299">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I must say, this sounds awfully like a massive tangle of red tape from a government that promised to rid small business of this burden. There are almost never any such records kept of the actual nature of the fuel used. It is simply not necessary or relevant for claimants to keep such records for the efficient management of their operations. As I have said, my amendments that I will move next will sort that problem out. We will support these amendments, however, for the reasons I have given.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a move that would seem to have been aimed at pre-empting Senator Cook's amendments to eliminate a requirement for logbooks for tractors, which will follow. The contentious terms such as `logbooks' have been excluded, but the effective requirement to substantiate the actual nature of use remains and logbooks or their equivalent may still be required. However, there is no contradiction between this amendment and the one to follow. The Greens will support this amendment. I think the more general requirement in this amendment can be interpreted to allow greater latitude in what is considered evidence of use. Therefore, we will potentially facilitate Senator Cook's amendment. The Greens will be supporting this amendment and also Senator Cook's amendment.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments have been suggested to the opposition by the National Farmers Federation to get around the problems that I referred to in the last set of amendments. I have here a memo from the NFF dealing with the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill&mdash;the bill currently before us. Appended to that memo is a legal opinion, which I will table in a moment, from Coors Chambers Westgarth&mdash;the lawyers that advised the NFF on this matter. The date of this legal opinion is 8 May 1997&mdash;just a short month or so ago. The text of this legal opinion is too long for me to read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> , but I will table the legal opinion, not the covering memo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the amendments do is insert a new clause&mdash;2AA&mdash;into paragraph 240A of the Customs Act and the corresponding subsection 120A of the Excise Act. These amendments apply to situations where a machine is used exclusively for an eligible purpose and allow an applicant in such situations to simply make a statement to that effect, which is sufficient record to justify the usage of the fuel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the debate on the previous amendments&mdash;the government's amendments 1 and 2&mdash;I raised the point about the `actual nature' of the use of the diesel fuel. This is a very prescriptive element in this bill. What does `actual nature' actually mean? It would appear that a description of the general nature of the use of the fuel would not be adequate. In other words, a statement to the effect of `for farming purposes' would need to be replaced with a much more detailed statement, like, `86 litres of fuel were used to plough paddock 3', or `26 litres were used to spray paddock 7', et cetera. We would have farmers not actually doing any farming; they would be occupied  full&hyphen;time reading meterings of the fuel level they are using, from meters which they do not
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4300"> currently have and which they would need to buy at great cost. They would then be doing complex calculations on what machine used what fuel for what purpose, filling in forms and signing declarations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is, why should a farmer, miner or prospector go to inordinate lengths to substantiate his claim, if all the usage of the machine that is the subject of the claim is eligible anyway. Such machines may include tractors, harvesters and stationary motors&mdash;powering pumps, et cetera&mdash;which have no ineligible use. They may also include vehicles and other machines which may well have ineligible usages but are declared to be used only for eligible purposes. I am sure Customs has the wit to apply some basic tests&mdash;such as whether the vehicle is road registered and whether it could be reasonably used for non&hyphen;eligible purposes. For example, it would be fairly hard for a farmer to make a case for his road registered Land Cruiser ute to be used only for eligible purposes without further justification, unless perhaps he or she ran a half&hyphen;million acre cattle station.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government may well say&mdash;as they have for every other amendment we have moved&mdash;that this opens the floodgates. It does not, because the penalties in sections 164A, 164AA, 164AC, 234 and 240 for people who get caught are immense&mdash;and made clear. As I said earlier, we think this makes the whole situation easier, from a record keeping point of view, without opening the floodgates and while ensuring that the revenue is protected. For those reasons, I move the amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment, if passed, would remove the requirements on all claimants&mdash;farmers, miners, fishermen&mdash;for beneficiation processes. In effect, it applies a `trust me' approach to substantiating claims. The government has removed any perceived requirements that logbooks are required for all equipment and has indicated that normal records of a well run office should suffice to substantiate claims for eligible use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this amendment, all that is required is for the claimant to state that a vehicle, vessel or piece of machinery is used totally for an eligible use, and this will suffice for record keeping and substantiation. No Customs auditor would be able to look behind this statement. It would be conclusive. For a scheme which outlays $1.4 billion and has been subject to significant criticism in relation to record keeping and accountability, such an approach to substantiation would, in our view, be tantamount to a blank cheque.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a measure to ensure that farmers or other users do not have to keep detailed records on equipment that is only used for a rebatable purpose. Why should farmers have to keep logbooks for tractors that are only used in farming. With respect, if Customs is worried about rorting, it is not a solution to have farmers keep a logbook on a tractor. If they are going to lie and say a vehicle is only used in farming, they can, equally, lie and fill out a logbook and substantiate such a claim. A logbook is not a proof against lying; it is simply a lot more work. It is probably easier to prove a lie when someone says, `I only use this vehicle for X purpose and I only use my rebatable diesel in X vehicles', than when they fill out detailed records justifying the diesel used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is, basically, a compliance issue. I see no real reason to force people to keep logbooks for vehicles like tractors that do get used exclusively&mdash;or almost exclusively&mdash;in farming. There is no point in that additional paperwork. I notice that Senator Parer has said that it will open the floodgates for all users. Perhaps, in that sense, we should get a response from Senator Cook as to why this is not likely to be the case.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My response is that you and I have explained it twice to the chamber now, Senator Margetts. This covers the machinery or equipment&mdash;the plant&mdash;that is used exclusively for rebatable purposes. If you have a stationary motor on a farm that is using diesel fuel, it is unlikely&mdash;or beyond comprehension&mdash;that that motor will be used off the farm in some other situation, because it is not
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4301"> a portable item. In that case, you would have to say that all fuel used for that stationary motor is eligible for rebate. If you go to a tractor or a harvester or some other item of equipment which is used on the farm for that purpose and consumes diesel fuel and thus is subject to the tax, it is fair to say that all the fuel it consumes is rebatable fuel for the purposes of this act. I do not think it opens the floodgates at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been conducting this debate for 9&half; hours, I understand. We have heard in the debate that every change we propose will open the floodgates or allow a boom in litigation or words to that effect, but we have never had any substantiation of those allegations from the government. A broad brush dismissal of a constructive claim&mdash;in this case backed by the NFF&mdash;would seem to me not to be adequate from the government's side, and the government should explain&mdash;with resort to particular examples&mdash;where it sees that this would open the floodgates, because it is our contention that it will not.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I wish to briefly speak to those amendments. As I mentioned earlier, the government, having heard the arguments I put, came to me and said that they understood what I was getting at but they felt that there was a better way in which it could be expressed. I listened to their approach and I think we have come up with a good alternative which will satisfy my needs. They reminded me&mdash;and we probably all know this, after a very long debate&mdash;that the DFR scheme constitutes an opt-in approach. In other words, nobody has to or is obliged to become a member of the scheme. When you opt-in, you are required to provide documentation or a case to support your application and then you are permitted to join the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems self-evident to me, both from the point of view of good business practice and from the point of view of proper accountability, that thereafter the applicant should in fact keep documentation which verifies that they have bought the fuel that is being used for this purpose. My belief is that they should be
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> keeping records in at least a general and practical sense as to how, when and where they use it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ANAO did point out to the government in their review of this area that they thought the audit procedures being undertaken were relatively deficient. Customs are amongst those departments which have been subject to government budgetary cuts and, frankly, they do not have the resources and possibly not even the accounting and auditing expertise to conduct audits which are widespread and effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequence is that, by and large, this is genuinely a trust system. It is genuinely a system where the bulk of the users of the DFR are not required to substantiate their use and their application, simply because Customs cannot get around and do even a significant sample audit. So what we are really dealing with here is a minority of applicants and users who are subject to audit&mdash;and it is a minority of applicants; a number which I think government would confirm runs into the hundreds of thousands, not just thousands. If they have broken the rules and regulations, they are subject to penalty and fine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then move on to the issue of whether&mdash;and it is the issue that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee raised and which I recounted yesterday&mdash;the rights of appeal exist. Of course, if you have a fine and decline to pay it, then you are subject indeed to a right of appeal. You can go to the courts and have the matter overturned. So there is an outside body over and above Customs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These particular amendments really refer to the core of the civil liberties issues which I was raising, which were the issues of the right to silence and the right to avoid self-incrimination, which characterise our principles of justice and our principles of dealing with these matters. My strong belief is that the right to silence and the right to avoid self-incrimination relate to a personal approach to matters and not to documentation. So the consequence of the amendments you have before you is that the right to silence and the right to avoid self-incrimination are preserved.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4304">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if you are required, and I think properly so, to be accountable in terms of your documentation then you need to provide it. I think that is entirely reasonable. It is entirely consistent with our processes and the way in which we operate our administrative and judicial system. On that basis, therefore, I was happy to accept the government's suggestions and to withdraw my amendments, which were somewhat more fulsome, and to accept their proposals. With that brief set of explanatory remarks, I commend my amendments to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is appropriate at this stage, particularly with the minister present, to reiterate my disappointment that the bill is facing its final vote without the most positive innovation
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4306"> having been taken up&mdash;that is, the proposal for the sun fund. This would have enabled the people of Australia who are being subsidised through the diesel fuel rebate to have taken 10 years worth of that rebate up-front and used it to produce renewable energy for their farmhouses, their cooling systems and their machinery sheds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only would this have been a real alternative for those conservation&hyphen;minded people on the land&mdash;there are thousands of them&mdash;but it would have stimulated local business in the small towns in regional Australia which so badly need it. Instead of the money just being circulated between Canberra and the diesel fuel companies, in effect, it would have put money into creating a sunrise industry presence in many of those small towns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is big business&mdash;640 megawatts is being used through diesel generation for electricity on farms which could be produced through photovoltaic cells, through wind power and through the energy alternatives which are now available in this country with the excellent technology that we have available. That is equivalent to half the output of the 39 dams in the total Tasmanian electricity grid. So it is a big domestic market which could have stimulated small business throughout rural Australia as well as given farmers a bit of cash in their pockets to be innovative about how they manage the electricity production component of energy production on their farms, not to speak of miners and other people who get this diesel fuel rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has apparently been premature of us to bring this forward, although it is just the sort of scheme that was being proposed a quarter of a century ago during the oil crisis when Australia should have taken the lead in this direction. I note that the opposition has said that they need more time to assess it. Generally, there has been a positive reception to the idea in this committee and the Senate committee hearing on this piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to foreshadow that I will be continuing to promote this sun fund idea from the Greens. It is a very positive one from the economic, employment, energy and environ
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment points of view. I will be bringing it back to the Senate. I would certainly be pleased to talk with government about how we can promote it. It is dollar neutral and it is  budget neutral for the government but it gives choice to the people on the land. It is certainly beneficial to the environment at a time when Australia has a long way to go to catch up with overseas thinking and to regain its reputation as far as clean, green, efficient energy production is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a number of options but one of those I will foreshadow here is bringing in discrete legislation in the not too distant future to re-visit this issue. In the meantime I will spend some time giving information about how this remarkably simple and positive idea for the bush and for Australia as a whole can be implemented to reassure the opposition and the government about the all&hyphen;round merits and the win&hyphen;win nature of this very positive proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am glad to have had this opportunity to flag this positive idea from the Greens, which has basically come through from community groups. I will be promoting it. I will be giving more information to the bigger parties about the proposal. I hope in the not too distant future that we will see it taken up and adopted with gusto in Australia for all the benefits it can bring, not just to people on the land but to Australia's reputation as a country, which is an environmentally clean and progressive thinking country, developing technology, which, of course, we can export and send on to people elsewhere in our own region as they too aspire to be able to have locally produced, clean, efficient energy, cheap energy and energy which is not leading to a long-term deficit through the greenhouse phenomenon&mdash;the global warming phenomenon&mdash;a long-term problem for those generations of people who will be coming after us.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments are the first step, if you like, in the set of regulations and monitoring provisions that we are seeking to insert into the bill. They relate to the code of conduct and the accreditation of private providers. Later, the Democrats will be sponsoring amendments, which we will support, which go to an employment council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeking to do is place into the bill the proper safeguards which we think are necessary for the creation of this new employment services market. Because the government has announced its intention to effectively set up a private market for services which have in the past been delivered largely by public sector authorities but in part by private sector case managers, we think it is very important that the accountability provisions in the bill are strong and that the protections for community interests are well established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has announced that up to $1 billion of taxpayers' funds will finance the new market, so we have a very keen interest in ensuring that that market operates effectively and efficiently and is properly accountable. This transfer of taxpayers' funds solely to fund these private players in the new market makes this whole area a real responsibility for this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our first amendment to clause 11 sets out the primary objects in engaging the EPEs, reinforces the objects clause and seeks to make clear the sorts of values we think should be primary in the market. Clause 11A sets out the code of conduct for employment placement enterprises. All we are suggesting is that that code of conduct be drawn up by the minister after consultation with the national committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware, subsequent to our approach to these matters, that the government has in its tender documents for the new market institut
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ed a code of conduct for potential tenderers. We think that is a good thing and, on a quick analysis of that, I think it is going down the right path. We think it is very important that that code of conduct is included in the act and that the necessity for EPEs to comply with the code of conduct is stipulated. That should all be contained in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment relating to section 11B makes provision for the minister to make other decisions in relation to the engagement of employment placement enterprises. The provisions ensure the minister is not limited at all by the primary objectives provisionally placed earlier so as to take into account other issues if they are relevant, but making that a disallowable instrument so that the parliament can have some review over that process. The amendment dealing with section 11C provides for accreditation of employment placement enterprises. It puts in place the accreditation regime which makes sure that only those persons who comply with the code of conduct can be tenderers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a great deal of concern within the community from current providers and consumers that there is the potential for persons to establish EPEs which may not necessarily have high ethical standards and may not necessarily act in the best interests of their clients but rather purely operate for quick profit. We think that is the danger in this new market system so we are very keen to ensure that the accreditation system provides, with other measures, those safeguards to ensure that the $1 billion of public funds are utilised properly and that the clients, who are the unemployed of Australia, receive first&hyphen;class service and the best value for money that the public dollar can buy for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The section 11D amendment seeks to establish a register of private employment placement enterprises. This is to ensure reporting of those who engage in industry, allowing for the parliament to monitor what is occurring in the market by means of the employment secretary maintaining this register of who is engaged to fulfil what&mdash;the Public Service function, if you like&mdash;in the new market.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4310">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 12, which I am moving as part of the same package of accountability measures, seeks to provide for an annual report on the operation of the employment placement enterprises and the provision of that report to the parliament. It is all part of an approach to providing proper accreditation, accountability and review by this parliament of the large amount of public funds to be invested in this new market. It is part of some broader approach to accountability, which includes other measures that will be moved later on. We think these are very necessary amendments to ensure that the public interest is protected.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans has made the case for the amendments but I would like to concentrate on two parts. It is important to point out that amendment No. 11, which deals with section 11, actually outlines what we think are some of the standards that EPEs should be able to meet. We think things like providing services in a fair, just and expeditious manner are important. Meeting high ethical and professional standards with the rights of users and privacy considerations is important too. I know the government thinks it is doing all this via other means.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 11B allows the minister to make objectives in addition to the primary objectives and in addition to the code of conduct, which need to be taken into account by the employment secretary when deciding if an EPE should be engaged. I thought you said that if we went ahead with this amendment it would result in all the selection criteria for every EPE having to be set out in writing. I think you said you thought that was an un

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government went to the people of Australia at the last election with a commitment to improve the affordability of private health insurance. We are doing that in two ways: we are making sure that those who are on low to middle incomes are given incentives by way of tax assistance. We are also making sure that those who are on higher incomes actually have to pay a higher levy if they do not take out private health insurance. It is important to start to recognise that the public system cannot keep going while people who could be using the private system are not doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is very important that the opposition has at last recognised the relationship between private health insurance and the success or otherwise of the public system. We have always understood that connection and that is why we have offered incentives. For the same reason, we have put disincentives on those on high incomes to rely solely on the public purse.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of a reference in the media this morning to a US energy department report which supports aspects of our own Australian analysis. There has, in fact, been something of a flurry of comment on the economic impact of uniform reduction targets in recent days. I have not as yet seen the draft report referred to by Senator Ferris, but let me make the general point that it is not only ABARE's economic analysis which points to significant economic and sectoral impacts on some countries, including Australia, as a result of uniform reduction targets; it is also instructive to note that some 30 to 40 United States senators&mdash;from both sides of their chamber&mdash;have supported a resolution expressing concern at the financial and economic impact of any United States support for uniform reduction targets. As we have repeatedly stated, the European led push for unrealistic uniform targets across annex 1 countries achieves very little for the environment and has the European Union bearing the least cost of all&mdash;surprise, surprise!</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to note that the reported resolution of the US Senate says that the US should not sign a treaty `which would result in serious harm to the economy of the United States'. That is exactly the view of Australia. Economic analysis undertaken by ABARE highlights the damaging sectoral impacts on our economy under a uniform target. ABARE has found that a uniform reduction target&mdash;even one far less stringent than that proposed by the European Union&mdash;would decimate the non&hyphen;ferrous metal industries in Australia and the iron and steel industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Output in the non&hyphen;ferrous metal industry would be some 50 per cent less than it would otherwise have been by 2010, which makes it substantially less than today's level of production. This would lead to serious job losses and regional effects in Victoria and Queensland. Production in the iron and steel industry would be some 25 per cent less than it would otherwise have been, with dramatic regional employment dislocation, particularly in New South Wales and South Australia. Australia's coal output would also decline significantly relative to business as usual, with significant job losses in Queensland and New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the critics of ABARE would like to make out that the GDP reduction of some two per cent which we would experience is insignificant. They overlook two important factors. Firstly, a two per cent reduction in our projected GDP level is far from insignificant. The loss to Australia in 2010 would be about twice the reduction in GDP we experienced in 1990 because of the drought&mdash;or half the benefits of micro&hyphen;economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, dramatic regional dislocation would be experienced in places like the Illawarra and the Hunter in New South Wales, the Bowen Basin and Gladstone in Queensland, Geelong in Victoria, Port Pirie in South Australia and the Kwinana region of Western Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the issue you have raised. However, the funding is administered by the Minister for Health and Family Services and his portfolio. I have with me a note from the minister, and this might help you. The briefing is that the national secretariat component of the community sector support scheme has recently been reviewed to ensure that funded organisations provide focused and representative input to the health and family services portfolio. The decision about which organisations would continue to be funded under the CSSS was very difficult and, in considering the outcomes of the review, it was necessary to balance the competing demands for limited CSSS funds while at the same time ensuring that the scheme supported the government's priorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As such, it was not a decision about savings but rather a decision about allocating the available funds to meet existing priorities. Dr Wooldridge and Mrs Moylan, who have both been involved in this course, are very pleased with the overall outcomes of the review. It means that organisations at the lower level of funding will receive an increase in their funding level. Several organisations, such as
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Deafness Forum of Australia, the Carers Association of Australia and Asthma Australia, move from seed funding to ongoing funding, and two new organisations, Heart Support Australia and the Australian Council for Volunteering, will now be funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate that a small number of organisations, including the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, will lose their CSSS funding. There remains, however, a significant capacity for input to aged care policy through other organisations funded under the CSSS.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, it is interesting: we have had this sort of question in one form or another from the opposition over several months now. We also had it for some hours in the Senate estimates committee a week or so ago. I do not think they are prepared to listen to what the facts are. The facts are that in the last year of the Keating government over a billion dollars was spent on child care. Last year, the first year of the Howard government, we spent $1.1 billion. That is an increase of $100 million, or a 10 per cent increase last year over the Keating government's spending. This year, spending on child care will be $1.146 billion. Over the next four years, this government will spend $4.8 billion on child care, and it will continue to grow at three per cent real growth in each of the next four years.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is hardly the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4318"> actions of a government trying to cut out child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a bit of fanciful footwork by some members of the opposition about this so-called claim that we are sending women back home and that that is somehow some terrible plot. We are doing no such thing. The opposition spokesman was using figures recently which were quite mischievous&mdash;or certainly very ignorant and ill-informed. The March figures that she purported to use, saying that women with dependent children were all going home because of our policies, in fact showed that women with dependent children had increased as a proportion of the work force and that it was, in fact, student women and women without dependants who were no longer in the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been doing a number of things that in fact are going to actually help women in the work force with their child&hyphen;care needs. The one thing that you never hear the opposition talking about is the major reforms in the area of out of school hours care because the focus there is going on the parents and their ability to afford it, not on the centres and their ability to use taxpayers' money to be less efficient than they need be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through all the questioning that we had in the Senate estimates committee, the only questions in this area were about how it would affect the centres. There was not one single question about how parents would be affected by out of school hours care. For women in the work force, there is nothing more important than before and after work care. We have a policy of improving access to child care and making it affordable. There is a considerable increase in the child&hyphen;care assistance that is going to families, where currently many families get no assistance at all and even those who do stand to gain from the removal of the operating subsidy to some of the out of school hours care centres.</PARA>

That is an across Australia increase of 3.7 per cent. However, Commonwealth funded undergraduate student places in regional universities will grow by 4.5 per cent between 1996 and 1999&mdash;that is, there is a stronger growth in the regional areas. That is an extra 3,300 undergraduate student places for regional Australia, student places that will provide opportunities for young people in central and northern regions of Queensland&mdash;Senator Reynolds, you should be supporting our policies&mdash;and in country areas of New South Wales. That would give others reason to support us as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Enrolments at regional universities are very healthy this year&mdash;much to Labor's dismay. Fortunately, students in regional areas have not been deterred from enrolling at university because of all the misleading babble coming from the other side. Preliminary figures from my department show that regional institutions have in fact overenrolled at the undergraduate level by four per cent this year&mdash;nearly 3,000 students. Students from country areas, like their city counterparts, are well able to see the value of higher education and the bargain that they are getting through HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to revenue for teaching, the fact that regional universities are overenrolled at the undergraduate level this year is significant because, from next year, the government will
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4322"> give institutions the minimum up&hyphen;front HECS payment for every undergraduate student enrolled above the Commonwealth target&mdash;more money than the previous government would have given them. Regional universities, like metropolitan universities, will benefit from this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have asked my department to do some projections on the income that regional universities will receive for teaching in the period 1996 to 2000, and it makes interesting reading. The operating grant that the Commonwealth pays to regional universities is known, and that will effectively remain the same over this period, at around $870 million. To this base figure we need to add projected payments for overenrolments which, if universities are overenrolled by the same amount as they are this year, would be another $11 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If enrolments of fee paying overseas students increase by 10 per cent a year for the next three years, regional universities will earn an additional $60 million a year by the year 2000. That is not an unreasonable proposition. If the enrolments of fee paying postgraduate students grow by 16 per cent a year over the next three years&mdash;much less than the growth this year&mdash;they will have more money from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line is that the funding for regional universities is assured. Total funding for teaching at regional universities is therefore projected to increase by about eight per cent.

I am pleased to say that now under the coalition government, with good cooperation around Australia between environment ministers, real progress is being made. For Australians who are vitally interested in issues of environmental protection, that is good news.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, at the meeting of the National Environment Protection Council last Friday in Cairns, it was decided to release in terms of the act a draft national pollutant inventory. This is another subject that Labor talked about for years but was not able to deliver to the Australian people. This will enable Australians to have the information that they deserve and are entitled to about emissions into the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> air, land and water in their local environment. It will provide individual communities and business with detailed information about pollution emitted into the environment, whether it be from nearby industry or passing traffic. When established, the NPI will pinpoint emission areas down to the size of the postcode zones of residential and industrial areas across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The NPI is a process that we expect to be concluded early next year after we have been through the statutory period of consultation. To implement it successfully, I can advise that we have been having trials in Port Pirie, Launceston, Newcastle and Dandenong. They have been undertaken successfully. We have also initiated three new programs to help a successful implementation. The first is with Western Mining Corporation and the Western Australian government, which will begin a trial in Western Australia, particularly looking at areas of industrial and mining emissions. Secondly, the New South Wales EPA is developing emission estimation techniques, which will assist industry to implement the NPI. Thirdly, the Queensland government, in partnership with my department, is planning an integrated trial of the NPI in south-east Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can see that it is a cooperative venture with governments and with the private sector to deliver to the community the information to which they are entitled. In order that the information might then be properly disseminated to the public, my department continues with its development of an on&hyphen;line interactive Internet database, through which the public will receive this information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we have released an official's draft of an ambient air quality measure. You will be aware that the issue of air quality is the highest issue of environmental importance to the Australian public. This measure will set air quality standards, targeting the six most significant pollutants to which the majority of Australians are exposed&mdash;carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, photochemical oxidants, sulfur dioxide, lead and particles.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McKiernan is absolutely correct: at no stage during her answer, and in the answer to the supplementary question, did Senator Newman, who is the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services, attempt to deal with the issues raised in the question. I remind the Senate that the minister was asked a specific question: was the government aware of advice being given out by the Taxpayers Association of Australia which encourages people, particularly those on high incomes, to avoid the Medicare levy increase and, at the same time, continue to use the public hospitals system?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that, when this government came to office, it trumpeted loudly how it was going to solve the problem of the declining membership of private health funds. It introduced two specific measures. Firstly, it introduced a measure which was to provide a rebate of up to $450 per year for persons who took out private health insurance. Secondly, it introduced an increase of one per cent in the Medicare levy, which would apply to persons who did not take out private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The theory was that, by their having to pay that extra one per cent levy, the high income earners in particular would be forced to take out private health insurance. I well recall the Treasurer, Mr Costello, saying that this was a charge that he hoped he would never have to collect. He hoped that it would force high income earners who did not have private health insurance to take out health insurance. The theory was that, rather than paying $1,500 or $2,000 in tax if you happened to earn $150,000 or $200,000 a year, and then
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4326"> continue to pay your own health costs and be treated as a public patient, you would opt for private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that these proposals are simply not working. The industry is saying that. For instance, in last Sunday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS> a spokesman for the HCF is quoted. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Federal Government's prediction that people would flock to private health insurance to avoid paying the tax `sounded great in theory, but it hasn't happened so far'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, it is not going to happen. You would expect that, if people were going to avail themselves of the opportunity to take out private health insurance and avoid a higher Medicare levy, they would have done so by now. It is a system that is just about to come into force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second and most important point&mdash;this was really the nub of the question that was asked which the minister failed to answer&mdash;is that it is possible for high income earners to avoid paying the Medicare levy increase&mdash;the one per cent&mdash;where that amount is substantially higher than taking out the cheapest form of private health insurance, that is, taking out the discounted private health insurance packages that are available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was indicated in the question, and as has been reported, the Australian Taxpayers Association is actually advising people to do this. They are saying, `You can go to a private health fund and purchase private health insurance on a discounted basis for, say, $500 or $650 a year. If you happen to be earning $120,000 a year, you are no longer going to have to pay that one per cent levy, or $1,200.'</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4327">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it seems we are looking at now is a situation where the Australian private health insurance industry can no longer operate on a community rating basis and may have to go to the kinds of policies which are offered in America&mdash;where people either insure for specific illnesses or, if they have specific illnesses, are excluded from private health insurance. That is the triumph of Medicare and, as I have said before, I think the ALP should hold their heads in shame over what they have achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government packages offer from 1 July are inducements to get people back into the private health sector so that the private hospitals can be used and some of the pressure can be taken off the public hospitals. Let me just run quickly through the list of inducements which will operate from 1 July, either as an up&hyphen;front deduction off premiums or as a tax rebate at the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, singles earning up to $35,000 a year can claim between $100 and $125 per annum. Couples earning up to $70,000 a year can claim between $200 and $250 a year. Couples earning up to $70,000 a year and with a child can claim $350 to $450. The threshold rises by $3,000 with each additional child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Individuals who do not have private health insurance and earn more than $50,000 a year will pay an extra one per cent Medicare levy on their taxable income. Couples who earn over $100,000 per year who have children and who do not have private cover will also have to pay the extra one per cent on their Medicare levy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures are designed to get people back into private health insurance, to redress the drift away and to overcome in some small way the legacy Labor created of the hopeless situation we have in Australia at the moment&mdash;with overcrowded public hospitals, long waiting lists and crowded outpatient departments alongside empty private hospitals.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We just had an interesting recitation from Senator Eggleston. He obviously is one of those members of the Liberal Party who has a policy of getting rid of Medicare. What else would be the basis of his attack on Labor and its policy to support Medicare? He just
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made an outrageous outburst and attacked Labor for introducing the most forward&hyphen;looking health reform this country has seen this century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we did hear from the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) in yet another one of her non&hyphen;answers&mdash;it was another question this side has asked during question time and not received a reasonable or proper answer to&mdash;we were told, `We have discovered health insurance.' Let me say clearly that this side of the chamber knows more about this issue than does the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We said this scheme would not achieve the results the government claimed. That has been borne out now not only by the continuing reduction in the number of people who hold health insurance and the continuing decline in health insurance applicable to families, but also by the fact that the health insurance funds have taken the government's move as a signal to increase their premiums. If anything that, combined with the public's distaste for the private health insurance system and the way that people are loaded up with extra charges after they have paid their premium, has driven more people away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at the figures, we see that, since the government announced its policy, HCF has increased its premiums by more than 12 per cent, its second premium increase this year; Medibank Private, by up to 23 per cent; Manchester Unity, by 17&half; per cent; MBF, by 15 per cent; and Australian Unity, approaching 20 per cent. So we have seen people pay more now in terms of their premiums and, when they get the rebate, they will still be worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would this government be able to say with any authority that they know more than we do about health insurance? Clearly they do not. Their scheme has backfired. It is costing people more and it is driving more people away from private health insurance. Not only is it not going to increase the amount of take&hyphen;up of private health insurance but people who are allegedly going to pay more because they did not take it out will find a way to get a backdoor reduction in the tax they would have had to pay by joining up to what is a  health
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4328"> insurance scheme that you have when you do not really have health insurance. As was outlined in the question, to save $530, an income earner on $120,000 can take out a $670 premium which is not really going to be of great assistance to them. The main benefit of the premium is to avoid the tax they would have to pay if they did not take it out. Those people will still have access, as is conceded my Minister Wooldridge, to the public health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a dodgy health scheme and we have no saving to the public health system if these high income earners choose these low cost schemes. For them the public health system will remain the cheapest option. The cost of fund membership growth has negated the benefit to families who were promised a net benefit out of the government's scheme. As I said before, in most cases those families are going to pay more, even with the government rebates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, we understand this system much better than you do. That is obvious by the outcome of your policies. Your policies are costing families more, not less. People are voting against these proposals by continuing to desert fund membership. Now the income that you were planning to receive through the government charging high income earners a higher levy will be reduced without any real effect on the demand for public health services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Taxpayers Association, in their magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxpayer</EMPHASIS>, has published this scheme, which means that this will be widespread knowledge. We can therefore expect those people to use the scheme to employ various mechanisms to minimise their tax burden. The Taxpayers Association, in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> on 10 June, said that the health funds provided the tip&mdash;that is, MBF in particular&mdash;on how high income earners could save on their Medicare levy. As I said, the minister has said it is viable.

Surely they are not trying to convince the parliament or the Senate or me that they are now born&hyphen;again advocates of the private health insurance industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They presided over a government that made sure that everything they did was designed to ensure the decline progressed as opposed to the decline being arrested. To hear Senator O'Brien talking about people continuing to desert fund membership as though it is some fault of a government that has been in office for 15 months is nothing short of amazing, because it was the Labor government, the party of which he is a member, that made sure that the decline came about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation today where Australia's public health care system has always involved health care providers from both the private and the public sectors. Yet here we have an opposition, which has presided over the decline of private health insurance, nitpicking and criticising every single solitary initiative that this government is taking to ensure that that is turned around. Not only that, they are crystal ball gazing about the results of what is going to happen on 1 July as if the initiative has been in place for 15 months. It is just absolutely remarkable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind you, Madam Deputy President, of what the previous government did because the Labor Party will refuse to remind themselves of these short facts. The previous government&mdash;your former Labor government, Senator Forshaw and Senator O'Brien&mdash;took out $846 million from the private sector. Yet you come in here today criticising initiatives for getting people back in the system. You
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4329"> abolished the bed day subsidy. You removed the reinsurance subsidy. You required the funds to pay a 25 per cent gap for medical benefits. We are restoring much of this funding through the private health insurance incentive scheme and you have the gall to come in here and criticise the initiative. Maybe Senator Crowley will take the opportunity to stand up here and explain to the Senate and to the people of Australia why it was her government that took out $846 million from the private health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government supports the application of the principles of competition in the health arena. It supports the financing of health services on the basis of output and outcomes rather than inputs. It supports health services that provide continuity and integration of care; that find ways to break down artificial boundaries between providers, between the public and private sectors and between levels of government; and that improve our national performance in public health and especially in prevention. But we do not hear anything about that from the Labor senators any more&mdash;not a word. We hear nothing about making sure people get quality health care or about equality in access, because we had 13 years of a Labor government that made sure the whole system went down the gurgler. Now they are doing nothing but criticise everything that is designed to turn around what they created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is about meeting increasing demands. Medicare needs to be able to evolve and adapt itself to meet the changing conditions, something that the Labor government failed to enable it to do. The state and territory governments are investigating the use of the private sector to provide public hospital services. This reflects changes in the nature of public health service delivery, which means that it is often better and more efficient for some hospital related services to be provided in the community. But these changes will be explored in the context of negotiating the next Medicare agreement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are ahead on Medicare, Senator, so you just watch out! We are here today taking note of Senator Newman's answer. Firstly, Senator Newman had no answer. Secondly, very importantly, she contradicted what the spokesperson for her Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) said on this strategy. Senator Forshaw brought to the attention of this place the proposal for how people on the top incomes can avoid paying their full private health insurance costs and dodge their liability. An article quotes the spokesman for Dr Wooldridge as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anyone with private health insurance could opt not to use it and rely on public hospitals instead, he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But he said if high income earners adopted this plan it would undermine government attempts to relieve the burden on the public hospital system by forcing more people into the private system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what Minister Wooldridge admits and what Senator Newman could not admit in this place: that this proposal runs counter to government policy. She should have at least been able to say that, but she could not. She defended, in a vapid and pathetic way, what is quite clearly a strategy that is counter to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4330"> your government policy, which your health minister admits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about time that he admitted that something was wrong because what you are doing by way of policy to help people is spending $1.6 billion dollars of taxpayers' precious dollars. There is no money for pensioners and superannuants. There is modest money for family planning services. There is no money for the Non&hyphen;English Speaking Background Women's Association&mdash;$40,000 or $50,000. But there is $1.6 billion to subsidise people who will not take out private health insurance&mdash;subsiding people to pay for costs, which subsidy rebate has already gone in the massive increase in private health insurance costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government were passionately concerned that people get access to good health care. That is why they introduced Medicare to make sure that that good health care was introduced in a way that did not cripple those people with huge debts. What you get with private health insurance are big debts. Senator Eggleston says that we are overloading the public hospital system; people are queuing up to get in. Of course they are. Why? Because it is so good. That is where the health care is good. It is where the doctors direct you and where the cost is no extra than your Medicare levy. Why wouldn't people go there? It is a very good thing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Eggleston also says that there are underutilised private hospital beds all around this country. If that is the case, why are we now seeing more and more people trying to build private hospitals? Probably because they are making the same daft decisions that they have always made in private health. There are $1.6 billion precious taxpayer dollars going to subsidise people in private health insurance. Now we have a system where people can actually avoid their full responsibility for private insurance. They can duck out of about $530 by way of advice from the Taxpayers Association. Under your bizarre system, people on the top end of town, who might have contributed a little bit to some kind of equity, are actually being encouraged to avoid the system.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister Wooldridge admits that it is undercutting the intention of his proposals, but Senator Newman in this place could not bring herself to say that&mdash;either she could not or she did not know the answer and, on the evidence, it is more likely the latter. Senator Newman did not understand and did not know the answer. Your policies are outrageous; they are not working; they are costing the taxpayers thousands of dollars. Citizens in this country wanted Medicare. They trusted Mr Howard with it. He has broken their promise and they will not trust him with it at the next ballot.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this issue of health and health insurance, when Labor was in government they could not even make up their minds. On the one hand, in 1993, Mr Keating said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a bare minimum, we must try to stop the decline in private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When we started off in 1983, it was 63 per cent: almost two&hyphen;thirds of all Australians were covered by private health insurance. By 1996, under 13 years of Labor, it was 34 per cent. Senator Richardson knew. No wonder he got out of here and went off and did other things. He could not bear to be with you any longer because he was saying these sorts of things when his Prime Minister was saying, `It's all wonderful. Everything in the garden is rosy. Medicare's really working. They are just leaving the private health insurance system because the public health system is so good.' That is not what Senator Richardson was saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to remind honourable senators on the other side of this. I do not know whether they read their policies before they went to the election last time.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable `active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME><FROM>(from 55 citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill proposes amendments to remove the budget for the Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA) from the budget for the Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) effective from the 1997/98 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA) was established, on 1 July 1994, following a review of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 which recognised the separate and distinct nature of Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current funding arrangements for the TSRA require the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to consult the Chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, the Chairperson of the TSRA and the Commissioner representing the Torres Strait zone on the TSRA's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since its establishment on 1 July 1994, the TSRA has demonstrated its ability to discharge its functions and responsibility in an exemplary manner. As the TSRA matures, increased autonomy should be accorded to enable it to manage its own affairs and prioritise its functions. The separation of funding arrangements from ATSIC would facilitate this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the act to allow the TSRA to negotiate its estimates directly rather than through ATSIC. Its budget bids will be competing with all of the Commonwealth government's other spending priorities.</PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REPORT OF THE INQUIRY INTO THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL TRAINING AUTHORITY.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee tabled the report on the Inquiry into the operation of the Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) on</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">30 November 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee acknowledges that the establishment of ANTA represents a good working example of cooperative federalism, but recognises that there is a requirement for fine tuning and modification in some areas and for this reason has made a number of recommendations for the improvement of the operation of the ANTA Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Progress has been made on implementing a number of the committee's recommendations. Several recommendations are being considered further in discussions with the states and territories on a revised ANTA Agreement. It is the commonwealth's objective to have a revised Agreement finalised as early as possible in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to committee recommendations 3, 5 and 11 the government, through the ANTA Ministerial Council (MINCO), has made a commitment to the development of a national vocational education and training (VET) system that is responsive to and accessible by business, including small and medium enterprises. It is the government's intention to ensure that business is given a leadership role in the system and that training provided is relevant to business needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendations 6, 7 and 8 are being addressed through the recently established ANTA Performance Review Committee and the National Advisory Committee on Vocational Education and Training Statistics (NACVETS). The Performance Review Committee will advise the ANTA Board on an appropriate set of Key Performance Indicators for VET. The commonwealth regards the development of better national data and performance outcomes as one of the primary objectives
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4339"> of its involvement in the ANTA Agreement. NACVETS will be the vehicle for addressing improvements to data collection methods and will provide advice and policy direction on national information requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to recommendation 15 and Minority Report recommendation 7, it is a priority of the government to work with the states and territories to create a national VET system that is accessible and equitable to all groups in the community. The government recognises the importance of TAFE as a key provider of VET in Australia, particularly in regional areas, and recognises the important social and "second chance" role that TAFE plays in providing further education and training for students from disadvantaged groups. Within this objective, the allocation of funds to individual training providers is a matter for state Training Agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 16 is currently being addressed through work being undertaken by ANTA in developing national principles for the operation of group training companies (GTCs). This work includes consideration of funding arrangements for GTCs and how governments purchase group training services, with the overall objective of increasing the number of apprentices and trainees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to recommendation 17 and Minority Report recommendation 4 the government has taken steps to ensure that schools will have an increasing role in vocational education as providers of accredited training, particularly for students seeking to begin apprenticeships and traineeships while they are still at school. The government's reforms to the apprenticeship and traineeship system incorporate key initiatives for school to work transition. In the 1996&hyphen;97 budget $187 m over four years has been provided for school VET programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government supports the need for ongoing professional development of VET teachers referred to in recommendation 18 and Minority Report recommendation 5. A committee has been established by ANTA CEOs to address professional development issues. In addition, the National Council for Vocational Education Research (NCVER) has been funded by ANTA to conduct research into VET professional development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to recommendations 19 and 20 and Minority Report recommendation 2, the ANTA act was amended in December 1996 to increase the size of the ANTA Board from five to seven members. MINCO Ministers will be consulted on appointments to the additional places. The government will be seeking to ensure broader business participation on the Board. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's position on the recommendations relating to use of growth funds and planning arrangements will be addressed in the context of the development of a revised ANTA Agreement. The revised agreement will also address the recommendations of the Report of the Review of the ANTA Agreement commissioned by the Council of Australian Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">committee recommendations that will be addressed in the context of the development of a revised ANTA Agreement are 1, 2, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is envisaged that, under a revised ANTA Agreement, there will be streamlined planning and improved accountability arrangements to replace the current State Training Profiles. The commonwealth and the states/territories would continue to provide funding stability for the national VET system.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">LAW ENFORCEMENT IN AUSTRALIA&mdash;AN INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee (PJC-NCA), which summarises some of the topics discussed at a meeting the committee held with Mr Raymond Kendall QPM, Secretary General, International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol), was tabled in the Parliament on 24 February 1 997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee report has concluded that inter-agency cooperation at an international level is essential in order to benefit Australia's readiness and capacity to confront international criminal activity. The committee's report summarises discussions held by the committee with Mr Kendall on Australia's relations with Interpol, law enforcement and security, electronic commerce, immigration issues, paedophile activity, and mutual assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee's report makes recommendations on three matters; Australian representation at the Executive Committee of the International Criminal Police Organisation; the need for Australia to take a leading role in developing cooperative arrangements between law enforcement bodies in the south-west pacific region; and the importance of ensuring that there are no unnecessary legislative barriers to inhibit the flow of information and intelligence between security and law enforcement agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendations, together with the government response to each recommendation, are set out below:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The committee recommends that the Australian Government promote the appointment of an Australian representative to the Executive Committee of the International Criminal Police Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendation is accepted. The government is actively promoting the appointment of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police as an Australian representative to the Executive Committee of the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol). Representation in this  forum by a senior Australian law enforcement officer would provide an opportunity for Australia to contribute where appropriate to the development of Interpol policy, including resource allocation, outcomes, and increased effectiveness. That said however, Interpol, while facilitating contact and the exchange of information between agencies, does not become involved in actual operations. More often than not, Australian law enforcement agencies either relate directly with overseas agencies or through the Australian Federal Police (AFP) interna
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tional liaison network for actual operational outcomes. This will continue to be the case in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The committee recommends that the Australian Government take a leading role in the development of cooperative arrangements between law enforcement bodies in the south-west pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendation is accepted. The government assists in the development of cooperative arrangements between law enforcement bodies in the south-western pacific region. Some areas of contribution include the involvement of the AFP, the Attorney-General's Department, AusAID, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the Department of Defence and the Australian Customs Service(ACS) in the coordination of Australian support to law enforcement in the South Pacific by an Inter-Departmental Committee chaired by DFAT, regular meetings of Customs Heads of Administration Regional Meeting (CHARM), of the South Pacific Chiefs of Police Conferences, and of the Australasia and South West Pacific Region Police Commissioners' Conference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth agencies continue to support south pacific nations' law enforcement agencies through the provision of operational cooperation and training where appropriate. The AFP and ACS are working with the South Pacific Forum Secretariat to deliver illicit drugs training and identification programs. The AFP's South Pacific Liaison Officer assists regional law enforcement authorities by promoting effective cooperation in tracking the movement of criminals in the region, working to strengthen fraud prevention, and providing assistance to improve regional authorities' awareness of, and ability to counter money laundering activities. The Liaison Officer also provides appropriate practical assistance such as conducting international criminal checks on behalf of south pacific nations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The committee recommends that the Australian Government take steps to ensure that there are no unnecessary legislative barriers which would inhibit the flow of information and intelligence between security and law enforcement agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government accepts that there should be no unnecessary legislative barriers which would inhibit the flow of information and intelligence between Australian security and law enforcement agencies. There are several points that should be kept in mind. While the flow of relevant information and intelligence between security and law enforcement agencies is desirable, and in some circumstances operationally essential, there need to be appropriate legislative controls in place to protect the legitimate civil rights and privacy of Australian citizens. Legislative controls currently in place ensure that the activities of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) are restricted to legitimate security interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are areas of overlapping interest and responsibility between security agencies and police forces which necessitate close cooperation. The committee's report notes the particular need for exchange of information between agencies in relation to countering international
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4342"> terrorism. This is mentioned in the report as a particular concern in the lead-up to the Sydney Olympic Games. The Commonwealth and New South Wales governments are cooperating closely in planning for the security and enforcement needs of the Sydney Olympic Games. In this respect, there are already mechanisms established to ensure close cooperation between ASIO and law enforcement agencies, including relevant New South Wales agencies. Whether amendments to current legislation are necessary to facilitate such cooperation is currently under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASIO act provides a mechanism for provision of relevant information to law enforcement agencies. The functions of ASIO include obtaining, correlating and evaluating intelligence relevant to security and, for purposes relevant to security, to communicate any such intelligence to such persons, and in such manner, as are appropriate to those purposes. In relevant cases, this includes communication to law enforcement agencies. In addition, paragraph 1 8(3)(a) of that act specifically provides for the communication of information to law enforcement agencies in relation to the commission or intended commission of offences. While that paragraph is limited to indictable offences, this merely recognises the balance which must be found in a democratic society between collection of intelligence for national security purposes and the protection of the individual. It would scarcely be appropriate for ASIO to be providing intelligence in relation to summary offences, unless that information was relevant to security, as defined in the ASIO act. Subsection 19(1) of the ASIO act specifically provides for cooperation with authorities of the Commonwealth, Departments, Police Forces and authorities of the States and authorities of other countries approved by the minister as being capable of assisting ASIO in the performance of its functions.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also cooperation the other way, from law enforcement agencies to the security agencies. For example, both the AFP and the National Crime Authority (NCA) provide relevant information to Australian security agencies, subject to the secrecy provisions of their respective legislation. The AFP and the NCA are restricted from providing information to other persons or agencies except in the performance of their respective statutory functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concerns implied by the committee in its report that either security or law enforcement agencies may be "protecting their patches" were examined in the 1994 Report into the Review of Commonwealth Law Enforcement Arrangements. In implementing that report's recommendations, additional steps have been taken to ensure improved cooperation and consultation between security and law enforcement agencies. So called "turf protection" has not been an issue. A prime example of the degree of cooperation that exists between security and law enforcement agencies is the national counterterrorism program. The counterterrorism program demonstrates the utmost cooperation between ASIO and the AFP and other relevant Commonwealth and State agencies. There have
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not proven to be any legislative barriers to that cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly, the AFP, the NCA, and the ACS are members of the Consultative Committee on Security Intelligence, which:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> provides a consultative forum on security intelligence priorities;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> enables agencies and departments to identify their security intelligence requirements (and so help ASIO and others to manage their product and research programs effectively);</PARA>

This is yet another example where this government says one thing while it is doing exactly the opposite. We have seen time and time again by ministerial press release, and now by the government's response to the Senate education committee's report of the committee's inquiry into the Australian National Training Authority, quite dishonest responses to the government's actions that are being taken and quite clear attempts to misrepresent what is being done by this government. This report says, for instance, in a disingenuous way:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">And similarly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's proposed new funding arrangements allow for future growth to be derived from increased efficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What this report by the Senate education committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report of the inquiry into Australian National Training Authority </EMPHASIS> originally was all about was trying to come to terms with the enormous growth that is occurring within the TAFE sector and the vocational education sector across this country. It devised mechanisms by which there could be a rational and effective broadening of this parliament's commitment to the provision of resources to ensure that all Australians had access to vocational education and training. But what this government has done, quite contrary to what it says in this response, is to dramatically cut back the opportunities that are in fact available to Australians to participate in the vocational education training sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government implies that it is giving consideration to growth funding arrangements for future growth in this industry; what it does not say is that it has already taken the decision to stop the growth funding. It has already taken the decision. What this government says is that it is providing $4.5 billion for funding for the TAFE and vocational education sector. What it does not say is that it has cut back $183 million from the last budget, $72 million in so-called efficiency dividends over the next four years; it has unilaterally ended the $70 million in growth funding available for TAFE; and it has reduced the operating budget for ANTA by some 27 per cent over the last two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is why I say that this is a disgracefully dishonest way in which to approach these issues and an attempt to present to the public a position which is quite contrary to and inconsistent with the facts of what this government is actually doing. I think it is an appalling way in which to treat what is a very
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> important part of the education industry in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister says that the government has introduced a new program, the so-called new apprenticeship scheme. What he does not say is that the government has not provided the money to actually operate it. It would be an extremely unusual set of circumstance where a major initiative, a flagship initiative, is introduced without the necessary resources to actually fund it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen state estimates, based on advice given by Commonwealth officials to state officials, that the total cost of this program is in the order of $3.7 billion. How much money has this government budgeted for this program? Somewhat less than half of that amount. The exact level of future demand is a matter for some conjecture. The recent KPMG consultancy entitled `The cost and resourcing of new apprenticeships' highlights the range of projections that are in fact open. It all depends entirely upon what policy decisions are taken by the government. But what is quite clearly, unequivocally, the case is that all in the industry agree that the growth in the so-called new apprenticeships will be quite dramatic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The level of growth in the first couple of years, I think all would say, will be slight. But by the year 2000 there will be significant growth. I have seen, for instance, comments by the minister that the states are likely to see a dramatic growth. I saw a speech recently, delivered in Sydney by the chief executive officer of the Australian National Training Authority, that said that he thought there could be up to a 50 per cent increase in the level of new apprenticeships as a result of initiatives taken. No-one in the industry is actually suggesting that there will be anything other than growth in this sector. But what does this government do? It budgets for a very minimal increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The KPMG report highlights that the present rate of spending is around 20 per cent. In their opinion, it will need to grow, in terms of resource allocation, to 30 to 40 per cent of total resources. No-one disputes that that growth will be dramatic, while there may be
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4347"> some comment about whether 30 or 40 per cent is appropriate of total outlays. Some say in fact it could be greater. What does the KPMG report suggest as the way in which that money should be found? It says there are basically five policy options that need to be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first is the issue of so&hyphen;called displacement. It says that you could transfer students from one course to another. Very limited  options are available there. You take could away people's rights in terms of doing diploma courses or associate diploma courses. What it also says is that you make the states pay. Clearly, what the minister has indicated in his statement recently is that the states will need to find in productivity savings some $300 million a year. This is how he suggests there could be some 100,000 additional TAFE places found&mdash;the states themselves should fund them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also suggests that there could be some shift to the enterprise, that employers should be asked to pay more. Of course, we have seen that this government has no real interest in that. Also, this report suggests that there should be some increases in user charges and the introduction of a deferred payment scheme, which this government has been considering. On 23 May this year at the ministerial council meeting Minister Kemp introduced and sponsored a proposal by the Australian National Training Authority to do just that and could not get the support of the states. Why did he do that? Because he knows fundamentally that the `New Apprenticeship' program is substantially under funded, by as much as up to 50 per cent under funded. This is an appalling way in which to run a government. This is why I say that it is a disgrace that it should be suggested to us, in response from the government, that actions have been taken by this government which clearly are not being taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a major initiative, a major flagship of this government being introduced without the resources to support it and, on the contrary, the moneys being made available for the vocational, education and training sector are being dramatically cut back. What growth
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there has been in funding, which the minister boasts about, in fact, is no more than the normal inflationary growth, no more than the normal expenses you would expect. In fact, many of the incentives for employers to take up apprenticeships, such as those under the craft scheme, have been dramatically reduced&mdash;between 67 and 72 per cent for many of those programs. What you have is a dishonest and disgraceful approach being taken by this government which has been exposed by the KPMG report. The government is now trying to cover this up by trying to make the states pay for a program which they, the Commonwealth, have introduced and the Commonwealth is seeking to draw the political credit for. What is all this about? It is a complete contrast to debate in recent years which the Senate committee exposed in terms of the maintenance of effort by the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past the argument was about whether the states were holding up their end of the bargain for VET funding, whether they were paying their appropriate share. We said in government that the Commonwealth should and did provide very large sums of increases in terms of resources to fund the growth in TAFE and vocational education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The case now is quite contrary. The Commonwealth is bludging on the states and on the Australian people in the most dishonest and hypocritical manner. It is displaying what I suggest to the Senate is a totally inappropriate way in which to present and manage a government program and it is totally inappropriate for this government to introduce responses to reports which are quite clearly misleading and deceptive. In my judgment, it is an intellectual disgrace that a minister can present such a report which is blatantly untrue.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Amendment 13 seeks to deal with the PEPE. We, when considering this bill the other day, passed an opposition amendment which inserted into the definitions clause a definition of the public provider&mdash;the PEPE&mdash;as that organisation as established under clause 15. In this amendment we are seeking to give effect to that clause and to describe the role of the PEPE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without wanting to go over the whole debate again, the bill, as drafted by the government, contained no reference to the public provider at all. The opposition and Democrat amendments are seeking to place into the bill that public provider and ensure that the functions that are being provided by the CES continue to be provided. So this is the clause and the amendments that seek to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They do that in a number of ways. Clause 15A, as proposed in our amendment 13, establishes the public employment placement enterprise and provides that the `PEPE consists of such employees of, or persons appointed by, the department as are directed to work in PEPE'. So it sets it up as a Public Service provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 15B sets out the PEPE's functions. It is quite clear that this reflects the model that we have been arguing for throughout this debate. I do not know whether it is necessary to go through all of the arguments again; I suspect not. What we seek to do here is oppose the government's proposition that the PEPE be a private corporation unaccountable to parliament and establishes a private com
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pany. Instead, we want to set it up as a public provider. We think the effect of these amendments is to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 15B(1) sets out the PEPE's functions. This, I think, is the key amendment in terms of the opposition and Democrat approaches to this bill, in that we provide that the PEPE will provide the ongoing community service obligations to backup the establishment of this market. We want to ensure that the high quality labour exchange services that have been available to Australians since 1946 are maintained, that that universal access to those services is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite what the minister says, we are not seeking to impose restrictions on the government. We are seeking to maintain those services, those basic rights that Australians currently enjoy to access labour exchange services and to access them regardless of where they live or their ability to pay. As I say, this is the critical amendment, in my view, in this whole debate. We are very concerned that those services continue to be maintained and available to people who live in rural and remote Australia and to people who might live in areas where the market fails to provide a competitive market for employment services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have pursued at estimates and other venues the question of how the government's model is going to work in rural and regional Australia. Quite frankly, the answers have been less than satisfactory. The answer is basically, `Trust us. The market will work. Here we are establishing a market to pick up the failure of the labour market, but we have complete faith in that market.' Quite frankly, I do not share the minister's faith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She has admitted in a number of her documents that there may be holes and deficiencies in the market that might be addressed. But none of those is addressed in this bill. None of those guarantees is placed in the bill. None of the assurances the minister has given is placed in the bill. What we seek to do is to make sure that that basic community service obligation is met, that it is laid out in the bill and, quite frankly, that the PEPE has the role of providing those services where the market
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4350"> cannot, will not or fails to. So that is very important in terms of the PEPE's function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing we do, which we are quite open about, is seek in the second clause to ensure that the PEPE provides labour exchange services to those job seekers who the minister says are no longer a priority&mdash;that is, those who are not on unemployment benefits. We have had this argument over and over again with the minister saying that she wants to ration those services only to those who are on unemployment benefits. We are firmly of the view that other Australians&mdash;newly ar rived migrants who are not eligible for unemployment benefits, workers retrenched, workers with spouses in employment and a whole range of groups and categories of people&mdash;who have enjoyed the ability to access labour exchange services free of charge wherever they live or whatever their personal wealth should continue to be able to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think that is a basic community service obligation. It is a basic role of government. It is one enshrined in the ILO conventions relating to these areas. It is something that the Liberal Party supported in its policy platform at the last election and is something that has had bipartisan support for many years in Australia. If this bill is not amended in this way it will be a retrograde step. We think this is a key amendment and ought to be supported by the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect of this amendment is clause 15(c) which seeks to offer the staff the same conditions they currently enjoy under the Public Service Act and which were enjoyed by those employees who moved to the Commonwealth service delivery agency. Senators might recall that we had this debate then and the government finally accepted that those employees continue to enjoy the status of persons employed under the Public Service Act. That, again, is part of our ILO commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister will argue&mdash;and I understand this has been part of the rationale inside the government for looking to move people out of coverage by the Public Service Act&mdash;that this will not allow for a level playing field. My own view is that the changes mooted to the Public Service Act and the changes to the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Workplace Relations Act which the government has lauded and has said will bring all sorts of tremendous results for Australian workplaces can well be applied in this area as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no reason for us either to walk away from those people who have given service and want to continue to give service as public servants in the area of servicing the unemployed, or to walk away from their career structure and from the ethos of the public service that they wish to continue to provide. It is not unreasonable that we provide those protections for those employees. The flexibility exists within the current industrial relations system to ensure that the arguments about a level playing field, in terms of the employment conditions of those in the public and private provider areas, are addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The alternative argument is to say that the public servants who transfer to the PEPE must be forced to accept the same wages and conditions as the lowest level of conditions provided by a private provider. That is the corollary of the argument; that we must, in order to have a level playing field, bring them down to the lowest level of employment conditions. I do not think the Senate can accept that. I do not think it is necessary that we take that view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all those reasons, this is a critical amendment. I know it is strongly opposed by the government but I think it really goes to the heart of the sorts of employment programs and services we have in this country. This is central to ensuring equality of access to labour exchange services, which is a fundamental right of all Australian citizens.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, since we had that discussion, I went away to check that your retelling of their position was true&mdash; which I think is fair. You can argue with their retelling of their position to me if you want to. According to those who speak for the public servants involved, they are surprised by your comments. They say the clear majority of their members are absolutely committed to working under the Public Service Act. They say that you have provided some very limited guarantees that the government will honour accrued entitlements such as accumulated recreation leave and superannuation. They also say that, unfortunately, there are no guarantees about salary structures, hours of work, leave entitlements, allowances or other conditions that are traditionally associated with public sector workers.

They argue that their negotiating position in securing an agreement in the PEPE will be weakened.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter that I seek to engage the minister on&mdash;I see that the minister is engaged in taking other advice&mdash;is, in part, related to those comments which I referred to in my speech during the second reading debate. In September last year the minister was talking about this being an experiment which was not irretrievable and which therefore should not be equated to a jump into a `very big deep pool' because `you are not throwing out the CES; you are simply corporatising that portion of it which does not go to the shopfront'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to find out why the validity of those comments then in the mind of the minister has been overtaken. Rather than what was understood to be the creation of the CES as the Public Employment Placement Enterprise as some form of statutory corporation, it appears that what we have now is its creation as a commercial corporation. I take the term `commercial corporation' to mean what I think it must mean&mdash;that is, a corporation which stands or falls on its commercial capacity. If there is a level playing field and if there can be no guarantees to the PEPE about contracting and about work, as a commercial corporation, it is not guaranteed existence, in the same way as the minister indicated that none of the  charitable organisations are guaranteed a role or an existence in this area and in the same way as those private employment agencies now are not guaranteed a role in this system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would contrast that situation with some of the provisions in your exposure draft about contracting some of the services. It is stated that at the first tender process certain services in certain areas are not able to be let to tender because of perhaps a lack of interest and there will be an approach for services to be provided by fee&hyphen;for&hyphen;service. If that fails, the public provider, the PEPE, is expected to take it up on some sort of fee&hyphen;for&hyphen;service basis. I take it from the exposure draft that the PEPE does
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4352"> not necessarily&mdash;or perhaps just does not&mdash;get a look in at the second phase of that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you do get to that third phase, if the commercial corporation that the government proposes as the PEPE fails, there will not be anyone there to provide the community services organisation unless you create a new one. In other words, if you create a commercial corporation and the commercial corporation fails and the tender process fails, what do you do then? Do you start afresh? Do you start with an organisation which may now potentially have expertise? You see it fail potentially and you then have to create it again from nothing. That is the very big deep pool that I think you, Minister, were referring to in September last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned because in some of those more remote areas in Australia&mdash;perhaps it will not be in Tasmania because of the relative decentralisation in that state and the availability of population centres right around the state&mdash;and in some of the states where population is more widespread, it will not be economic to deliver these employment services that you talked about. I think you mentioned Laverton before question time earlier this afternoon. I have a fear that we may end up with an experiment which fails in those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that the CES services could be improved. We did have a debate about how we might deal with our concerns about that in the context of this legislation earlier today. What we are faced with here is potentially a collapse of the services that people in these employment service areas receive. I would appreciate, Minister, to hear your views about that very big deep pool so that perhaps we can pursue the matter further.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do find this debate somewhat difficult because I regard some of the contributions as being slightly platitudinous. I say that with some degree of regret because it is not normally the sort of insult I like to pass to colleagues. There is currently no requirement on the CES to deliver any employment services anywhere&mdash;
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">no legislative requirement at all. This is legislation approved of by the previous government and supported by the Democrats. There is no requirement whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All this government is trying to do is to ensure that unemployed people on benefits get treated first in any queue and that we end the segregation that they have been delegated to&mdash;which is that they can go to the CES and get services free and everyone else who has a few bucks in their pocket can go to other professional providers like Morgan and Banks, Drake Personnel, the Brotherhood of St Laurence or Centapact. There are a whole of range of providers that they are locked out of. We intend to have a situation where unemployed Australians on benefit can pick and choose the employment provider of their choice. We will pay the employment provider of their choice to provide them with a service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to that, we have people on the other side saying, `This is a shocking thing; you will not guarantee that the newly corporatised PEPE will be in every town, every region and every place.' They say that without any embarrassment, maybe not knowing that the CES is basically one line in the act at the moment&mdash;`There will be a CES.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CES does not have the requirements placed on it that you want to place on the new public employment placement enterprise. You want to ask a whole lot more of the new enterprise. I do not know whether you have predetermined to be difficult about this legislation just because you want to look after the CPSU, or whether you do not understand how the CES is now structured. It is effectively described in one line in the act&mdash;`There will be a CES within the department.' I understand that prior to 1994 there was some legislation but no more than that&mdash;just the establishment. Then in 1994, under Labor's Employment Services Act, we shifted to the single&hyphen;line reference to the CES.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators opposite stand up and demand so much more of the new corporatised public employment placement enterprise than they were prepared to demand of their own government for the CES. I find it unacceptable that you would demand more of this
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4353"> change than you were prepared to demand of yourselves. It points to the pretty shallow debate we have had thus far and indicates a predetermination on your part not to support this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reference has been made to the benefits of the staff. Senator Kernot, who is not technically in the chamber but is in the room, has indicated that we had a conversation, which we did. She asked how the CPSU felt about the arrangements we had made for CPSU staff, Public Service staff, to shift over to the PEPE. I indicated to her two things. Of course they are not saying, `Yes, we'd like to go!' There was never any pretence that they were jumping around and clapping their hands with glee saying, `Yes, we'd love this change!' But, in the circumstances where the government had the capacity to make change, want ed to do that and the change was going to be made, it was said that the conditions the staff would be provided with were much more than they expected we would be offering and that they were pleased with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you go to speak to them, Senator Kernot, it will be no surprise that they will say, `Of course we do not want to change.' No-one ever made any pretence about that. But, in the circumstances where there is going to be change, do they believe that these benefits are pretty good? My answer to that remains yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me run through what the benefits are, lest anybody think there has been some attempt on the government's or my part to reduce the benefits available to these people, who are currently doing an excellent job and who, frankly, are sick of waiting for this bill, are wanting to get on with the job and are wanting to show that they can compete without extra protection and that they will compete very effectively and will do the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the staffing arrangements that we have negotiated? The current substantive salary will be maintained and protected under the first PEPE certified agreement, which obviously will operate from the commencement up until the following year, with future remuneration being negotiated through subsequent PEPE certified agreements, consistent with the Workplace Relations Act, including the no disadvantage test. There will be ongo
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing access to CSS and PSS, that is, superannuation. Obviously sick leave and recreation leave credits which have been built up will be retained and carried over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing coverage of the long service leave act will continue. At least the equivalent of APS redundancy entitlements prevailing at the time will apply in the event of a redundancy&mdash;at least the equivalent. There will be mirrored APS and maternity leave provisions until any new arrangements are agreed on. There will be the indefinite right to apply for APS vacancies advertised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. Prevailing APS mobility provisions will apply on transfer to the PEPE, such as the right to return to the APS in certain circumstances, notably if staff become excess in the PEPE. This is a very good package of conditions, with which senators will be aware.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me deal with a couple of other points. I think Senator O'Brien raised the question of whether this is going to be a corporate entity and whether it therefore will be like a corporate entity that rises or falls on its commercial success. Well, it is a commercial entity in terms of the Corporations Law. In a sense, it does commercial work: it will compete commercially to provide services to unemployed Australians on benefit and young Australians. How well it does in that respect depends on how many young Australians and unemployed people on benefit it places into jobs. If it is good at its job, it will continue to get a very successful share of contracts from the Commonwealth; if it is not, it will have a diminishing share&mdash;just like everybody else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over and above that, it has other obligations. It has a community service obligation. It can be directed by the minister to provide services where the minister decides that services ought to be provided. Where the initial tender arrangements have not found an adequate supplier and a secondary round of fee&hyphen;for&hyphen;service has not found an adequate supplier, then the minister can direct the company to do that. It is unlike a range of other companies in that the Commonwealth is the only shareholder. So it is subject to direction of the Commonwealth. But in all other respects, it competes commercially.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4354">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are absolutely committed to proceeding with PEPE staff shifting out of the Public Service so that we have a genuine level playing field for staffing arrangements. We have gone to great lengths to ensure that the staff who move over in the beginning&mdash;they probably are not going to be there in 15 years time&mdash;have all of those protections there so that they can move back into the Public Service, and apply to and shift to other areas and have in place at least the APS conditions for superannuation, et cetera. I will not bother repeating them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have gone to great lengths to ensure that those people are protected in that respect. Those who stay will be able to negotiate the conditions that they choose to negotiate under the workplace arrangements, including the no disadvantage test.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does that mean? There are people out there who want jobs. They are not on a benefit because they want a benefit. They are
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4355"> on a benefit because they cannot find a job that they want. We think it is perfectly fair&mdash;more than fair; it is appropriate&mdash;to put those people first in any unemployment queue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, other people might like more work or they might like some work. But we do not think you can argue the case that unemployed people on a benefit and young Australians should be put anything other than first, and that is what we intend to do. That is why we reject your amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Vanstone, I was looking forward to hearing some comment from you about the reason for the change. Nevertheless, I cannot resist the challenge to respond to a couple of things you have said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, to suggest that there is only a one&hyphen;line mention of the Commonwealth Employment Service in the Employment Services Act  is a little removed from reality. There is a definition which establishes it in one line in clause 8, but I have not been able to count the number of times it is mentioned in relation to a number of services in the act. What we are talking about in terms of creating the public employment placement enterprise is one&hyphen;and&hyphen;a&hyphen;bit lines in 15A(1). After all, 15A(2) could only be considered as a transitional provision. So we really are not doing much more than preserving it in the form that you said you would preserve it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But when we go to the question of the PEPE's functions&mdash;and you have touched upon some of the reasons why we differ on the role of the PEPE&mdash;we need to specify the function of the PEPE in the context of the changed role. The fact is that part of the CES functions have gone to the service delivery agency and it remained as some form of labour exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We disagree on the form and we put a proposal in amendment 15B(1) for, effectively, the charter for this new organisation. In 15B(2) we implemented what we believed ought to be a guarantee, particularly to those 400,000 unemployed people who are not catered for by the PEPE or by any employment placement enterprise in the bill as it stands. We agree that we disagree on that. We
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are putting forward our position in relation to providing a labour exchange service to those people who are not covered by your provision as well as those who are. Okay, we can have a debate about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am tempted to suggest that your prioritisation of those on benefit is probably the only measure that I can see from your government which attempts to deal with the long-term unemployed. Because they cost the government money, they are going to be prioritised in the provision of some labour exchange service, and those people who do not cost the government money are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that all that will achieve is the shuffling of the unemployment queue. For those people who are not entitled to benefit, they go down the back of the queue. For those people who are, they go forward. That is the inequity of the whole system. Because someone is on a government benefit, they are to be preferred, and someone who is not on a government benefit will go to the back of the queue. So if they cannot afford to pay for a service and if they are in a state where employment agencies can charge for that service, they are in a pretty difficult position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a climate where you are actually encouraging a relationship between employment providers and employers who provide jobs, you could see a lot of those people locked out of employment opportunities that now arise under the system where you have got the CES and private providers. You do not really have a facility, for example, where it would be quite feasible that an employment placement enterprise would be paying commissions for jobs to get the fee for service that you are offering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could see the circumstance where some of these people who are shuffled down the back of the queue are denied opportunities to jobs that they would now have because they are available on the open market. Your scheme is likely to remove some of the jobs from the open market. As I think you said, Minister, these agencies will effectively be selling jobs because they will establish relationships with employers. They will be passing the jobs on and being paid by the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4356"> Commonwealth to do that, having established those relationships. Your system is going to deny some of the 400,000 who are not going to attract the benefit the opportunity for employment that they now have, whether they go to the CES or not. But you are also saying to them, `You are not going to get the services that you can go and get now, whether you get them now or not, because that will not be available.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is one of the problems that we have with your system. We are not saying, Minister, that we are going to frustrate your system. We are saying that there are deficiencies in your system that we are trying to correct. So, let us get away from this question of whether we are gilding the lily as it were on replacing the CES from the Employment Services Act with the public employment placement enterprise in the Reform of Employment Services Bill. I think that is a red herring. Let us get down to the real debate,  which is: what are we going to do and what are the circumstances going to be for the 400,000 people who are not going to be entitled to any service as a matter of right under this bill as it stands unamended?</PARA></SPEECH>

There are numerous other references to the CES but they are in relation to the legislative framework surrounding case management. It does not deal with the distribution of labour market programs or labour exchange&mdash;not at all. It deals with case management, which was the innovation introduced in 1994 by the previous government and put in the legislative framework.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, you say this government wants to put unemployed people on a benefit first because they are costing us money. I suggest that you go and ask an unemployed person on a benefit whether they would like to be put first in the queue or whether they would like to be mixed up in the queue with other people whom Australian society have not judged, at the moment, to be as much in need because they have not allowed them a benefit. Would you ask the unemployed whether they would like to be put first?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect, that is an unnecessarily cheap shot. Of course pensions cost money. But I would have thought we had a common goal, whether it is for money or for the benefit of getting someone who wants a job a job, of agreeing that those people ought to come first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, you mentioned again the people you describe as being locked out. These are the people we will not put first in the queue. I have explained to you before&mdash;you made reference to it in the debate&mdash;in discussions about it in this place, which I will not go on about at length, that these people are not locked out. They have available to them the touch screens and the national vacancy database to find out where jobs are. Some of them will be open, some will not. Some will have to go straight to an EPE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have put the view to you that in some states those EPEs will not be able to charge in any event. Even in the states where, by state law, they would be able to charge, I am not at all confident that the EPEs would. The range and mix of people that an EPE has on their books is going to be the key indicator of their success. If they only have on their books unemployed people on a benefit and young people&mdash;that is, people for whom they can get a payment from the Commonwealth&mdash;I venture to say they will not survive. That is because, in order to be successful, they must supply what industry wants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What industry wants at any one time in Australia will not be available solely from the pool of unemployed people on a benefit and young Australians. They will have to have others on their books in order to provide what industry wants. The EPE that says, `No,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4357"> sorry, I am only dealing in this group of people because that is what the Commonwealth will pay me for,' will pretty soon find that industry is not interested in dealing with them. They will have to have other people on their books.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you know, in a variety of states at the moment when someone wants to find someone for a job and they go to an agency they pay a fee. The employer pays a fee rather than the employee. But there will be competition amongst EPEs for the non&hyphen;entitled people to be on their books because if you want to be a successful EPE you will need a big range of those non&hyphen;entitled people on your books so that you can fill industry's needs.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, we might needs some rules for how you can repeat conversations that we are having all around the place. I think the rule will be that I will never say anything I do not want repeated. That is fine. I think you  misheard me, though, in that conversation we had. I stressed wanting them to be treated as individuals. I wanted to work out why people should be excluded because they are in a relationship with others. I said to you I wanted them to be treated as individuals, not excluded because they are either married or in a permanent relationship with others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, I did say that of course everybody says to put the unemployed on benefits first. But the point we have been making all along is that there is a difference this time because people might have to pay a fee or, through various means, they are either being excluded or having their services severely reduced for the first time. When you keep saying Labor wants more than it was prepared to give you might be right. But I think the relevant argument is that we are totally changing the regime now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are moving into a deregulated corporatised regime where you rely again on competition and level playing fields. If anything we have learnt in this place over the last 10 years is true then we all should look at the theories we are talking about here. We have learnt that the more you deregulate the more you require safeguards. If you take the example of banks
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and you apply the theories, you look at what deregulation has done, whether competition exists and what level playing fields exist, you find out that when you give up the public provider, which the Commonwealth Bank might have been an equivalent of, you take away levers to influence competition and better standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that is left is for you to say to the banks, `You naughty people; you are not passing on the interest rates' or, `You naughty banks; it looks like there has not been much competition there.' You keep berating us for wanting to put in place a few more safeguards. But we need to do these things because we are moving into a much more deregulated regime. The lessons of the last decade are that you need to be more careful; you need to protect people more, not take rights away from them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make the point that I think the minister has done a good job at arguing an argument that is not at stake here. If you are reducing services to the unemployed and you are cutting funds for labour market programs and training programs, to come out and say, `This is all about giving priority to the unemployed' is a nice try, but it is one of the worst arguments that I have ever heard, and it is a dishonest argument. What this amendment is about is trying to protect the position whereby people continue to be entitled to the labour exchange services on a universal and free basis that they have enjoyed since 1946, both for employees and employers. We are not trying to stop you giving priority to the unemployed. Your market provides variable amounts of money to allow those people who are long&hyphen;term unemployed&mdash;those most disadvantaged&mdash;to be allocated additional funds to give them priority, to give them special assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this amendment is about is stopping you from removing services to rural and regional Australia, to the 400,000 people who currently are registered but not entitled to unemployment benefits, and ensuring that the Commonwealth continues to provide the community service it has provided for 50 years to all Australians. What we are seeking
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4358"> to do is to enshrine that in the legislation. And you are right: a range of these provisions have not been enshrined in the legislation before, because no&hyphen;one has suggested before, except in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS> document in 1993, that we would walk away from those obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has not been a live debate. It is not a debate that you had with the Australian public at the last election. It is not one that you have been keen to have now. You have been keen to change the subject. What this is about is ensuring the maintenance and provision of basic labour exchange services as part of the community service obligations in this community. It is not about denying to those registered unemployed the ability to receive assistance in their search for work. That is achieved now under your competitive market. We are supporting that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a separate issue. This is about providing services to those others in the community who are without work and in search of work. You can argue about prioritising the unemployed all you like. It is dishonest. That is not what this is about. It is about your decision, because of the cutbacks in the budget, to save money by not providing that service to those who have received the service in the past. We say that they should continue to receive that service, and we also say that those who are long&hyphen;term unemployed, those with other disadvantages, should receive the employment assistance as proposed in other sections of the bill. Let there be no misunderstanding by people who are listening to the debate: the minister's argument is a nonsense. This is about whether you continue to provide basic labour exchange services to all Australians and to Australian employers.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say a few words about this. You have been through this proposed amendment again and again, Minister, and I think you have put your argument, as Senator Evans says, very well. As I understand it, your argument is that you are going to make services available to people on a competition basis; that competition will provide some regulation and, in addition, there will be some regulations provided by contract, statute and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> regulations; but, fundamentally, it will be a provision of services on a private enterprise basis with a regulatory regime on top.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that this particular provision provides a much needed insurance against the situation that might arise under the proposed legislation, if this particular amendment is not passed. Section 42 of your amending bill illustrates that. It talks about the terms of agreement to be approved by the Employment Secretary. Subsection (1) reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The terms of an Employment Assistance Activity Agreement . . . are to be approved by the Employment Secretary.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This sets up a regime. But then, under subsection (4), it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Employment Secretary may, by writing, delegate all or any of his or her powers under this section in relation to agreements with a particular employment placement enterprise to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> if the enterprise is an individual&mdash;the enterprise; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> if the enterprise is a body corporate&mdash;a director or employee of the enterprise; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> if the enterprise is a partnership&mdash;an individual who is a partner in, or an employee of, the enterprise; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> in any other case&mdash;an officer or employee of the enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What that, in effect, means is that an employment assistance activity agreement can be written by the employment enterprise, which really does not give the person who is entitled to proper services any insurance that he will get those proper services, whereas this amendment suggested by the opposition and the Democrats certainly ensures that. So this does give a much needed protection to people looking for employment services, which the bill does not give. As an illustration of that, I refer you to section 42, but you could go right through division 2 of part 4.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a couple of questions to ask the minister. There have been a number of contributions to this debate on the Reform of Employment Services Bill, and I have listened to it largely on the radio. A number of them have not been specifically addressed towards this particular measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4359">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that Senator Kernot made a while ago was quite valid with regard to there being a system established whereby the PEPE and the EPEs could be scrutinised very carefully as to whether they are efficient, whether they are providing the services that we all want them to provide and whether they are doing that in a fair and reasonable manner. I am attracted to the amendment that the senator is going to move at a subsequent stage of this debate with regard to the establishment of an employment services council. I personally think that ESRA has done a fairly reasonable job to date and I would be inclined to support the amendments that will be subsequently moved by Senator Kernot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That having been said, I must say that there are some concerns about what will become community EPEs. That is, the provisions of the amendments that we are now discussing may in fact have the result of giving to the PEPE a monopoly over the labour exchange services. I do not know if anybody would care to make a comment on that, but I would like to ask the minister&mdash;and I do so saying  that I am inclined to support the amendments that have been moved by Senator Evans: is the minister saying that, no matter what we do here in this legislation, the government would have the power to corporatise the public aspect of the service?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current legislation&mdash;I am not talking about this legislation&mdash;would it then be able to direct the particular organisation to target its services in line with priorities established by the government? Is that what she is saying? Is she saying that, if we pass this legislation now, and if that is not acceptable to the government&mdash;and I understand the minister has said there are certain matters that are not acceptable to the government and it is not going to cop it&mdash;it will enable her, or the government, to do what she wanted to do anyhow under the provisions of the existing legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to know that but, even if the answer to that is no, I would be inclined at this stage to support Senator Evans's proposals. I must say that I have been in two minds about the whole thing because of what the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government appears to be saying&mdash;that is, it has power in any event to do the things it wants to do. One then wonders why it brings the legislation before the Senate. I do not know whether one takes from that that there is a commitment on the part of this government to bring parliament into its decision making processes in the widest possible sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is the case, this government is somewhat unlike other governments that have governed this country, for the 22 years that I have been in the Senate anyhow. But I would hope that the government does look on the parliament as being an important part of the decision making process. Even though it can get its own way by other means, I suppose it is putting forward these matters because 140 minds are better than one, or better than the cabinet. Minister, is it a fact that, if this legislation in the end is not acceptable and if we adopt what Senator Evans is proposing here together with other amendments that have been made or will be made to the legislation, the government is saying that it can achieve its purposes under current legislation? </PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cooney referred to the powers of delegation. I will explain it this way. They are exactly the same as what is in the Employment Services Act now. There might be some words slightly different, but for all intents and purposes they are the same. What that relates to is the agreement that the provider makes with the unemployed person under, for example, case management. The previous government set up a system whereby a case manager made an agreement as to what ought to be done and then nobody cared whether the person did it or not. We were not going to have a situation where large amounts of money were being paid for someone to be case managed so that they could not ring their case manager when they were meant to, not go to appointments that were scheduled, not attend training courses or whatever was set up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The powers that are delegated, basically, is a system that relates to the continued payment of their income benefit. In a sense, they make
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4360"> an agreement to undertake these activities. If they break that agreement, then they can be breached in relation to the income payment. It is a mechanism to relate the two together. It has nothing to do with the contract that the secretary makes with the employment provider to provide services generally; it has to do with the contract that the employment provider makes with the unemployed person&mdash;the agreements that they come to as to the activities they will undertake and the capacity to breach them for not undertaking that activity. That is the difference there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to Senator Harradine's questions, I am advised that the Commonwealth does have the capacity to establish a PEPE as a separate corporate entity and that it does not require legislative approval to do that. I am advised that the PEPE could be directed to provide services&mdash;I would not say willy&hyphen;nilly&mdash;within certain constraints in accordance with the government's wishes. I have indicated that before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That would not necessarily be exactly the same as the proposal now before the chamber. This proposal before the chamber obviously  differs, in the case of the intents of employment assistance, from case management. It is an extension of it, but it has become something more, something different. Similarly, if we were to go down another route it may be different again. But we would still be talking about providing services and targeting them to unemployed people on benefits and to young Australians first because we are  determined to put them first. So, yes is the answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, Senator Harradine, you asked a question which I think, with respect, we did deal with last time. So I will not go to it at length&mdash;that is, if you can do what you want anyway, why would you come to parliament? I hope you meant, kindly&mdash;and I do not know if you meant it that way, but I hope you did mean it that way&mdash;that you approve of the approach that even if you do not have to come to parliament you might do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the situation we are in. We knew all along that we would be able to do things differently&mdash;not under the Employment
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Services Act, but under social security legislation. I looked at the two and realised that to go the other way was administratively more difficult. It is just a simple choice. It is administratively more difficult to go the other way, but it may in the end provide better services if that is what we had to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The flexibility that is there is just enormous. I was surprised by the degree of flexibility that is there, under existing legislation, for the Commonwealth to provide these services. There is enormous flexibility with almost&mdash;in the bounds of this generality that we are discussing&mdash;no restraints. That is why I expressed the frustration that now, when we want to corporatise that portion of the CES that has not gone to the shopfront, the opposition that allowed the situation for enormous flexibility in the services it provided when it was in government seeks to restrict this government's flexibility. I do find that particularly frustrating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made the decision, for a variety of reasons, that the legislative path would be the one that we would try. But it was not a decision that said, `We have the legislative power to go another way, but we will discard that completely and we will only proceed with these changes if parliament approves every aspect of them.' That was not the decision. The decision was to see if it was possible to get parliamentary approval for these particular changes with certain things that were essential. If that was not possible, there was always the other position to fall back on&mdash;administratively more difficult but, nonetheless, there.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just wanted to respond to Senator Harradine's concern about the question of a monopoly over labour exchange services. I just want to indicate to him that, quite clearly, that is not the intention nor the drafting instruction nor the effect, in my view, of these amendments. Section 9 gives the employment secretary the ability to engage an entity to provide employment services. That entity is defined in the definitions section and includes: individuals, body corporates, partnerships, government departments, et cetera&mdash;the whole range of service providers. So the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4361"> employment secretary may engage any of those entities to provide employment services. Employment services are defined, by the success of our amendment, to include labour exchange services. So we have already established in the amendments already carried to this bill that the employment secretary may engage an entity to provide those services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are doing with this amendment is not to provide a monopoly but to provide universal access. That is the issue: where persons are ineligible because of the government's decisions and because of their failure to receive unemployment benefits, where the market does not provide, where the service needs to be provided to meet our community service obligations, then the PEPE shall be engaged to provide those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of that prevents the government from taking a decision to expand its market or for that market to provide more of those labour market exchange services. Nothing prevents that at all. But what we are saying is that where the government does not provide that as part of the market then it must ensure that the universal access continues to be available to all Australians. So it is not about monopo ly; it is about universal access and providing the PEPE to fill those holes to provide the services to those people who the government would otherwise refuse to provide services to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to indicate that, from my reading, my attendance at the committee hearings when we inquired into the bill, my letters and my contact with community service providers, I think they would have a concern if there was a suggestion of our moving to make it a monopoly, but they generally support a strong public provider in the marketplace and the continuation of the public provider in that area of the market which is not be let out to competition. That is what this amendment is about&mdash;that section of the market that is not part of the competitive model being established by the government. They see a continuing role for the PEPE to service those clients and provide services to those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their major concern is one that I share and which I have raised in estimates committees and other places&mdash;that is, the funding of the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community service providers and their ability to compete equally on this so&hyphen;called level playing field. They have concerns&mdash;which, as I say, I share and would appreciate the minister addressing&mdash;that, because of their limited capital base, they will not be able to compete effectively in this market with the major international companies who provide employment services. As you know, they have been writing to senators and other members of parliament, seeking support for some measures to try to protect their position so that they are able to compete effectively in the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a tremendous investment in terms of skills and expertise in those community organisations. When I asked the question at estimates&mdash;because the minister had indicated in one of the consultation documents that some provision might be made&mdash;the answer was, `No, it is a level playing field. They don't get any advance payments; they compete on the same terms.' As we well know, their view is that that will discriminate against their competing on the same terms, because of their lack of a capital base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I looked at the question of whether or not we could effectively move an amendment to help in that regard. I do not see it as being possible. If Senator Harradine&mdash;or anyone else&mdash;has a suggestion as to how we might do that, I would be happy to hear it, because we want to see a market where the PEPE competes on equal terms with community groups and private organisations in the intensive employment assistance area. We want to see them bring all their skills and experience to the market, without facing disadvantages or hindrances because of any particular problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this is not about a monopoly at all. We looked at that question and rejected it. What we are supporting is the continuation of universal access to those labour exchange services for those persons that the government seeks to exclude from the market. If they are in the market, the government can choose to provide those labour exchange services as part of that market approach and, indeed, if the government decided to market just labour exchange for a wider group of people, they

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Minister, for the very lucid explanation of section 42 of the bill. I am still concerned about sections 40 and 42 of the bill and the proposed amendments by the opposition and the Democrats. What sections 40 and 42 do is to make vulnerable people even more vulnerable. If you have vulnerable people who must go to one of a range of employment placement enterprises, and if the government enterprise&mdash;the PEPE&mdash;is to be no different from the others, it seems to me that no reassurance can be given to a participant in these schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the proposed amendments, there is a statutory obligation on a government body to ensure that a high quality labour exchange service is available. It gives a participant in this scheme an ability to go to members of parliament and to government and perhaps even to have the provisions of the proposed section 15A and section 15B enforced. If you do not have that, you have a situation which is perhaps best illustrated by the draft employment assistance activity agreement on page 92 of the tendering conditions and draft contract for employment services&mdash;the exposure draft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That agreement is headed up `Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs', and at the bottom it says, `This form is approved by the employment secretary and the social security secretary under section 42 of the Reform of Employment Services Act.' The impression you get from that is that the agreement to be made between the job seeker and the agency providing it is all agreed to by the government, which is not necessarily so, given the provisions of section 42.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you carry the proposed amendments, at least you have a protective measure, in so far as you have a government body which can, quite properly and without any confusion, have an agreement&mdash;such as that one set out on page 92&mdash;signed. Nobody is going to be misled, innocently or otherwise&mdash;I am not, in fact, proposing that it would be done dishonestly. Where you have a form that says it is approved by the employment secretary and the social security secretary&mdash;whereas in fact it is approved by one of a range of employment agencies&mdash;you also have the situation of vulnerable people, as I said before, being misled and taken down a road to their disadvantage. At least to some extent, the amendments proposed by the opposition and the Democrats avoid that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Chris Evans&mdash;a small amount of polemics on your part. You want to stop us removing services to rural Australians when you know that in your own legislation there is no requirement for them to be provided. I just caution you that your polemics about this government wanting to get stuck into rural Australia will be shown to be as shallow as the polemics offered in relation to higher education, for example, where regional universities were going to fall apart. You were here in question time; you would have heard that they are doing very well. Don't you worry. We will look after regional Australia and look after them very well. They have great confidence that we will do that and are probably looking to improved services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cooney, as I understand the points that you are raising, you are looking to ensure the protection of the persons seeking services. I think it is fair to say that part 6 and part 10 provide those protections. There is recourse at the moment, for example, under case management, to the Ombudsman. I genuinely believe there is every protection provided here for a potential employee seeking work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, Senator Evans, we did believe that your initial amendments provided a lex monopoly to the PEPE. You did not believe that, I know, but you have subsequently changed them. What you are now providing, by way of your amendments, is a guarantee that the PEPE would get lex work. We have the same position on that as we do on everything else, that there are no guarantees that the PEPE, the private providers or the public providers will get any particular services. It will depend on how well they compete for them. I think that might clear up that point.</PARA></SPEECH>

Referring to the form on page 92, is it the intention that, whatever employment assistance activity agreement is signed, whether by a government organisation such as the PEPE proposed by the opposition and the Democrats or a private provider, the document will have the insignia of the Commonwealth on it; it will be headed, `Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs'; and it will have, at the bottom, `This form is approved by the

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are just a couple of points I perhaps have not covered. I am sorry, Senator Evans, you did raise the point about people wanting advance payments and not having sufficient money in the kitty to go ahead with that. Of course, for the intensive employment assistance, they will get an advance payment of 30 per cent. We think that is enough. If you think they either need more advance payments for intensive employment assistance or some advance payment for labour exchange work, I just refer you to Senator Brown's contribution last time in this debate. He raised a concern that a fly-by-nighter might get an advance payment and take off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do have to find a balance. We want to provide some advance payments in intensive employment assistance, because it may be expensive to get the services required. But there has to be a limit there somewhere. One of the protections is to say, with respect to labour exchange, `We'll pay you when you get the person the job.' But those current skillshares who tender and get intensive employment assistance work will of course have advance payments for that. But there is a balance to be found. I appreciate that point.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have to face the facts and see what is going to happen down the track. Whatever happens with this piece of legislation, it is not going to have a great effect, in my view, on the employment situation because the problem of unemployment is that there are more people in or seeking paid work than there are jobs available, at the same time as traditional jobs are being slashed by technological change. Whilst this is an important initiative, I think we are fooling ourselves if we think that we are looking at a panacea for the problems we have. I do not think anyone around this chamber, including the minister, is seeing this as a panacea. But let me go down the track a bit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard what the minister said&mdash;that, yes, the government do have the power under existing legislation, the Social Security Act or whatever other legislation there may be, to in fact establish a PEPE and to do so in the manner that they have told us they want. As the minister has indicated, that is going to be administratively more cumbersome than going this particular way and I am encouraged by the statement of the minister that this government does recognise that there is a parliamentary input into various policy matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the minister having said that, if we adopt Senator Evans's proposals, the ones that are coming up for the establishment of the employment services council and some of the other measures including the objects of the legislation, my concern is that, having done all that work, we may see the government then pulp this legislation and do what they want anyhow. That does concern me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to feel that, even if we do accept the propositions that are currently before us as proposed by Senator Evans, the government ought to give full consideration to these, go back to the House of Representatives and let them give full consideration to these matters and to what is being said in support of them in this chamber. No doubt there will be further matters raised in the House of Representatives and we will see what they think then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hope that would occur. It would give the opportunity for the government to reconsider but in the end I think the amendments, the improvements that the Senate wishes to make to this legislation, should not just be thrown out the window. It may be that, on a sticking point such as this particular matter, the government might say, `We'll amend that in the House of Representatives and bat it back to the Senate to see what they do with it.' Let us see what we do with it at that particular stage but I am rather inclined at this moment to vote for Senator Evans's proposition.</PARA></SPEECH>

These amendments have been suggested by community groups who have experience in dealing with unemployed clients to ensure that those clients have their rights respected and that their power relationship in dealing with EPEs is not such that they do not have full information or are  unaware of their own entitlements. These amendments seek to provide some protection and further information for those clients.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In amendment 14 I think we address something that has been removed from the bill, which was the old capacity to benefit test. I welcome the fact that that has been removed, or does not exist in this particular bill. I welcome the fact that this amendment says that these are the only things that you can refer to when someone is referred to an EPE&mdash;the participant's education, experience, skills, age and physical condition, the state of the labour market in the area where the participant lives and training opportunities available to the participant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the old notion of capacity to benefit there were a lot of people who were worried that they would be discriminated against unfairly. People with disabilities were one group. The effect of this amendment is simply
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to say, `Here's an incredible range of things that you can take into account when deciding whether or not someone can reasonably be referred to an EPE.' I think it is a comprehensive list and I do not think it discriminates. That is the point of that particular amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 17, as Senator Chris Evans said, simply says that helping job seekers to choose the particular EPE which is right for them is appropriate because it will probably greatly enhance the likelihood of their achieving a successful employment outcome. In order to make a choice about the most appropriate EPE, I think job seekers need to be fully informed about the options which are available, and that is what this amendment does.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The import of what we want to do here is to simply provide the basis for the cap and queue. We have cap and queue at the moment. I think that is the terminology in Immigration, but it is used in case management. There is not enough money to put everybody through case management who wants it. There was not under the previous government and there is not now. When the moneys run out and there is not enough money to pay for that service to be delivered, it would not be inappropriate to send someone. That is what this clause is getting at. It is not about the capacity to benefit; it is about whether the resources are available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since you mention the capacity to benefit, Senator Kernot, I just point out that if the resources were not available and you added that in&mdash;just say that you were prepared to agree to that amendment&mdash;which would allow the secretary to not have people referred when there was no money left, you would allow the secretary a much broader and less defined scope to refuse people. None of us like the terminology `capacity to benefit' but you would be creating a much looser capacity to refuse people in addition to funds not being available for other reasons, very loosely defined, which I think would be a mistake.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4367">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of us would like to imagine that everybody has the capacity to benefit from intensive employment assistance, but the community groups will tell you that that is not the case and that it is not fair to put people assistance who do not have that capacity through intensive employment. It is because of the consultations that we had with community groups following the release of the broad outline of these changes that we have introduced the community support program, which I think is worth about $10 million or maybe $11 million a year. It will mostly be for community providers to act as brokers and help these people find the appropriate help they need. If they have a drug problem and that is what is stopping them getting to work, intensive employment assistance is not going to fix that. They may have an alcohol problem or a mental illness problem. Often people in those circumstances do not know where to go to get help. No government before has provided a program like the community support program. I am grateful to the community providers for their advice and assistance in putting this together as a means of saying, `We'll help these people.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could argue that it is not an employment matter. If somebody does not have a  capacity to benefit from intensive employment assistance and they have got another problem, you could say it is somebody else's problem. This department has been prepared to say, `It's our problem to help you find assistance to get rid of whatever it is that is putting you in a position at the moment so as to not benefit from intensive employment assistance.' That is why we have introduced that aspect of it. I will come to amendment 17 later.</PARA>

What is being said now is that this is an economic tool to be used by the department broadly or narrowly to deny otherwise eligible persons even a basic labour exchange service. That is an even bigger reason why we should pass the amendment which Senator Chris Evans moved on behalf of the opposition and the Democrats. It is incredible that one could envisage circumstances where, because of the government's budgetary constraint, there may be jobs that a person on benefit could be targeted for through PEPEs but because the quota for that part of the year&mdash;the quarter, the half year or that portion of the year&mdash;has been taken up, that person is not referred at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this legislation is going to give the employment secretary the power to trickle out the unemployed over a period of a year, for example, then I think this is bad legislation. Whether that provision was in existence previously or not, in this environment&mdash;which is quite different from the previous environment&mdash;we are going to create a different circumstance. If this provision is passed unamended, we are going to be creating a  circumstance where an eligible person will not be eligible for anything&mdash;except perhaps looking at touch screens&mdash;merely because of the financial constraints placed on that region by the employment secretary.</PARA>

If you are assessed as not being eligible then under your broader scheme of things there is a community support program. You were wanting to take into account things like whether there was an alcohol problem, whether there was a grooming problem and whether there were literacy problems. Could you tell us how it would work if someone was assessed as not being eligible for intensive employment assistance and they had to go to the community support program? It is not covered in here, but you are relying on it.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with this clause now and this clause deals with the means by which the secretary cannot refer someone on in a very similar way to what happens now because of the limit of funds. Case management is now a capped program. It was, in the past, a capped program. It also deals with the capacity to not refer someone because all of the employment  providers who have been contracted for places have people in those places. This clause does not deal with the capacity to benefit. This is not the appropriate power relating to that matter. This is a resources clause and a capacity to find a spot clause; it is not the one dealing with those people who might be judged as not having the capacity to benefit because when they went to the shopfront the job classification instrument so classified them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, I will come to your question. We have now spent maybe 10 hours on this bill when it was decided we would probably get through it in eight. I am simply trying to keep the debate to the clauses at hand. What happens to the people who do not get referred as a consequence of clause 28 is the same as what happens to someone now who is on a list waiting for case management; that is, they do not get case management until the funds are available or the places are available. That is what happens.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Being deemed ineligible for a range of reasons is relevant. If you want to stick to this particular clause, that is okay, but the context is relevant too.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I don't know why you keep asking the same question in relation to a clause that does not deal with that. This clause does not deal with that: it deals with the resources available&mdash;case management now, which is not the same as but is similar to intensive employment assistance. It is a capped program. There is no willy&hyphen;nilly amount of money available. Providers have contracts to handle a certain number of places at a particular time and if
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4371"> the money has run out and/or all providers in that area are full, someone is going to have to wait until a provider is successful in placing people and they move from having 100 places full down to 99 places and when a place is available they can go into it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if you are going to continue to ask the same question I suppose I will answer the question you want to ask right out of context just to suit you. Why not? You are the Democrats; why not? If you would like to ask it now, let us deal with your queries now, completely unrelated as they are to the sections of the bill. Let us deal with it now to save everybody having to listen to you ask the same question again and again and be given the same answer again and again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community support program is, in this respect, similar to LEAP, to new work opportunities and to a whole range of other labour market programs. They are not programs that have a legislative base. You can pore through here to your heart's content but you will not find it. It is the same as LEAP in that respect and the same as new work opportunities and other labour market programs; in other words, a service is delivered under appropriation powers.</PARA></SPEECH>

I would have to go back and check the record, but I said, roughly, that, in relation to contracting, the decision had not at that point been made&mdash;I have not subsequently checked whether it has&mdash;and the secretary would be considering very seriously whether to delegate at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Labor Party believes that the government's proposal for a constitutional convention is a political exercise, an unnecessary and ill-conceived political exercise. We strongly believe that the best way to achieve a republic is via a sustained and rational debate by all Australians leading to an indicative plebiscite and, ultimately, a referendum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge the holding of a constitutional convention was a Howard pre-election pledge. It is an unusual pledge because the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) intends to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> honour it. I acknowledge that it is the preferred vehicle of the government's to progress the debate on the republic, but the proposals in this bill, which include a massive change from compulsory to voluntary voting, holding a postal ballot, not an attendance ballot and a change to optional preferential voting&mdash;all of which are of the greatest significance to all Australians&mdash;were never canvassed by the coalition before this legislation was introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor will not accept the government's plan to hold a non-compulsory postal ballot for the convention. The Liberals, in our view, are playing a huge confidence trick on the Australian people. These proposals are a blatant attempt to gain partisan political advantage for the Liberals, but the Liberals' master plan is also a grave error of judgment. Compulsory attendance ballots are a very strong tradition in Australia and the nature of such a ballot allows for a full national expression of the Australian people on their choice of representatives. Voting should be a communal act by Australians en masse, an affirmation of their commitment to democracy and its public processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both Mr Howard and Senator Minchin are on the record in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 5 May as stating they `won't be budged' from the proposed voluntary ballot and that it was `non-negotiable'. Perhaps they should think a little more seriously about this because Mr Howard's experiment with voluntary voting is signalling to all concerned that he does not regard the constitutional convention as important and that in fact a debate over the republic of Australia is a second string issue. Of course, many of the appointed delegates to the convention, those from the various parliaments around Australia, have themselves been elected at compulsory attendance ballots.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, any referendum on an Australian head of state would require a compulsory attendance ballot. Somehow, in the middle of all this, Mr Howard is proposing to introduce a gross mutation to and manipulation of our traditional voting system. The Prime Minister has to realise that, however much he wants to ignore the republic, it is an issue of passionate debate, it is an issue of vital national import
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4373"> ance and it is one every Australian should be engaged in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the many submissions to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee regarding this bill, there is an overwhelming call for the vote to be made compulsory. Ethnic groups, Aboriginal groups, women's groups and many individuals who do care that this convention is properly representative mount strong arguments in favour of the compulsory vote to ensure that everyone has their say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The supporters of compulsory voting even include former Liberal Party apparatchik Mr Petro Georgiou. In his paper entitled `The case for compulsory voting', presented to the John Stuart Mill Society,  he says that voluntary voting in the national context would be a grave mistake because it would overturn what is an ingrained political tradition. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to overturn compulsory voting would give the community an unequivocal signal that we as society's elected representatives have diminished our commitment to voting as a civic duty.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let me explain why Labor so strongly supports our current system of compulsory voting in Australia and why the Australian Labor Party will entirely reject any moves away from this system. Compulsory voting is the hallmark of our democratic electoral system. It is what empowers people in the Australian democratic process. Everyone has a stake in the outcome and we believe that it is essential in our democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When all Australians have had the opportunity to participate in the electoral process, whether you like the outcome or not, it is  pretty hard to argue the outcome is not the will of the people. We are absolutely committed to the system of compulsory voting that has served this country so well and any moves away from this system will be strongly opposed by Labor, despite whatever threats the Prime Minister and his cronies may wish to hold over us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compulsory voting has been part and parcel of the Commonwealth electoral law since 1924. It is worth recalling that, when introducing the Commonwealth Electoral Bill,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator Herbert Payne of the National Party said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If people exhibit no interest in the selection of their representatives, it must necessarily follow, in the course of time, that there must be considerable deterioration in the nature of laws governing the social and economic development of this country.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Since that time, voters have, in Senator Payne's words, ensured that those who live under our form of government `see that it is democratic not only in name but in deed'. I challenge anyone to dispute that the system of compulsory voting has operated successfully throughout the country. Moreover, research has consistently shown that a vast majority of Australian voters support it. Professor Don Aitkin, commenting on his own research, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A plausible explanation is that the great majority of Australians subscribe to the belief not only that they ought to vote, but that unless citizens do in fact turn out and vote the framework of their democratic society will be in some danger.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">People genuinely accept that citizenship and participation in a social democracy brings with it certain obligations&mdash;obligations that are largely unquestioned as part of our daily lives: paying taxes, attending school, driving on the right side of the road, abiding by the law and, of course, compulsory voting in elections. The acceptance by society of such obligations is what keeps and promotes our social and political cohesion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compulsory voting actually diminishes the alienation of the disadvantaged and disaffected from the political process. What we in the Labor Party believe is that compulsory voting actually provides society with a sense of ownership of the results of elections regardless of their outcomes. Voluntary voting would actually remove the obligation that is currently placed upon people to participate or to take an interest in issues that affect them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why does this government want to undermine our system of compulsory voting? There are two agendas that are being pursued by the Howard government through this legislation. The first is to throw obstacles into the path of the republic. The second, and more insidious, is their commitment to undermine our democratic process by abolishing
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4374"> compulsory voting in  favour of a voluntary system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party Federal Council supported voluntary voting in 1988. Senator Parer, when he was shadow administrative services minister, was an enthusiastic advocate. Senator Minchin has been an obsessive supporter. Senator Minchin has just convinced all government members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to support voluntary voting. Only yesterday, the committee recommended that Australia's compulsory voting system be scrapped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Electoral procedures for this convention are really the first step in the Liberal's implementation of that policy. We say that the Liberal's approach is fundamentally un-Australian. We have already heard a lot of arguments from the conservatives against compulsory voting. The two most frequently used arguments are that it restricts the freedom of the individual and that the vote of the apathetic voter is not worth having.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the burden of compulsory voting is extremely light&mdash;and, certainly, it is perceived to be so by the vast majority of voters. In fact, it was ex-Senator Chris Puplick who described voting as `a minimum obligation of citizenship'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Strong and effective democracy requires at least a minimum degree of participation by all its citizens, not just those who are anxious to influence the system so as to get something out of it. The decisions of government affect everyone and they are much more likely to be made on behalf of everyone if everyone plays at least some role in selecting the members of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The argument that compulsory voting caters to the lowest common denominator by enabling elections to be decided by the least informed and the most apathetic is elitist in the extreme. I believe that elitist view was encapsulated in the words of the Liberal's long time candidate and now member for Canning, Ms Ricky Johnston. She was reported as saying in 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A compulsory system meant `dregs of society' got a say whereas with voluntary voting only those who were interested actually cast a vote.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is little doubt that under systems of voluntary voting those who tend to turn out
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are overwhelming middle to upper class and better educated than those who do not. All available evidence that I have seen about non-voters points to the fact that they tend to be young, from lower socioeconomic groups, often of a non-English speaking background and disadvantaged. In short, they are the people for whom governments have a  special responsibility. They are the groups who have less access to the resources to enable them to put their views forward to influence policy formulation. Who is to say that their vote is to be given less weight than that of the so-called `informed' sections of our society? They are John Howard's so-called `poor', `needy' and `most vulnerable in our society'. There is no wonder that Mr Howard wants to disenfranchise those to whom he promised so much and to whom he has delivered so little&mdash;in fact, those people in our society whom Mr Howard and his government have abandoned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the constitutional convention, the government has tried to advocate that Australians should not be compelled to vote at a ballot for a convention that is not binding. Yet, as we said in our minority report on this bill, the convention will be binding to the extent that its recommendations will form the model of the republic that will ultimately be put to the people at a referendum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill advocates not only voluntary voting but a voluntary postal ballot. This is again a first for a Commonwealth election&mdash;plebiscite or referendum? We in the Labor Party believe that it is a very retrograde and serious precedent to set. A voluntary postal vote will not deliver on John Howard's commitment to a consultative process involving all Australians considering the issue of Australia becoming a republic. Labor is implacably opposed to a postal ballot for the constitutional convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone who has changed their address since the last election and not notified the Australian Electoral Commission is going to miss out on a ballot paper. This will wipe out the vote of many hundreds of thousands of people. Anyone who may have trouble with the ballot paper or the process&mdash;and it is an unnecessarily complicated process and I want to address that issue later&mdash;would normally be
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4375"> assisted at a polling booth. Those people will now have to rely on an&mdash;as yet unfunded&mdash;hotline. Worse still, material will only be available in written English. For the blind, the frail aged, the illiterate, the disabled, the incapacitated and those who have trouble with the English language&mdash;tough! The government is not concerned enough about their vote&mdash;or our democratic process&mdash;to provide the level of assistance that they require.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to consider the experience of  voluntary postal ballots in Australia. Voter turnout is generally poor. In our minority report we cited turnout figures of&mdash;at best&mdash;60 to 70 per cent. More usually, the figure is around 30 to 40 per cent. This result will only serve to fuel the arguments regarding lack of consensus about whatever might be the eventual outcome of the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to hold a voluntary postal ballot has been defended by the government on the grounds of cost. Our response to that very feeble excuse is simple. The cost of democracy has never before been an issue in this country; it should not be an issue now. What price do the Liberals put on democracy? A measly&mdash;in this context&mdash;$13 million. With the help of the Australian Electoral Commission, the government has costed the postal ballot at just over $36 million, while they estimate a compulsory attendance ballot would cost only $49 million. The difference in cost of $13 million will be further reduced if larger envelopes are required by the AEC to post voting material to enrolled electors and if a number of other factors&mdash;that Senator Bolkus will outline&mdash;come into play.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say to the government that, whether the difference between a compulsory attendance ballot and a voluntary postal ballot is $13  million or less than $13 million, the integrity of our electoral system is worth the money. And, if the government is looking for up to $13 million for this, perhaps they can find it in their $1 billion Federation&mdash;slush&mdash;Fund. There seems to be plenty to go round there. There is no defence&mdash;budgetary or otherwise&mdash;for the government's proposed voluntary postal ballot. It can be justified only in terms of this government's lack of commitment to a republic and its desire to fundamen
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tally change our electoral system for its own political advantage by introducing voluntary voting through the backdoor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a move that only demonstrates further the government's desire to make this whole process as difficult and complex as possible, the government has proposed a ballot paper design and voting instructions which are so complex that voters will inevitably be confused and alienated. While the ballot paper layout allows either above or below the line voting, the actual ballot paper is quite different from the Senate style ballot paper to which Australians have become accustomed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's voting system for the convention allows optional preferential voting at the federal level for the first time in our history. Below the line voters can cast a formal vote for from one up to the total number of delegates to be elected in any state or territory. But it is not easy. What you have to do is place the candidate number of your preferred candidate in the first preference box and so on. You find the numbers in the guide to the Constitutional Convention, which is sent in the same envelope as the ballot paper. This&mdash;deliberately, cold&hyphen;bloodedly and with political opportunism&mdash;makes the casting of a formal vote as hard as possible. In above the line voting, groups and candidates can lodge a group voting ticket showing preferences for candidates at least to the number of candidates to be elected. Up until this proposal came before parliament, well&hyphen;motivated governments had tried to make our voting procedures as simple, straightforward and accessible as possible. The Labor Party believes that, on an issue as significant as whether Australia becomes a republic, we must maximise the opportunities for Australians to express a view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Mr Howard is saying, by introducing voluntary postal voting in this bill, is that those who are elected to the convention will have a diminished role, even though they will be discussing one of the most vital constitutional changes that this nation could ever contemplate. It is clear what agenda Mr Howard and Senator Minchin really have:
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4376"> they do not want a convention or a republic, but they do want to change the fundamental nature and characteristics of Australia's electoral system&mdash;not just for this convention but for good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the thin end of the wedge. The Liberals are using this election of delegates to the Constitutional Convention to attack the integrity of Australia's electoral system, but we in the Labor Party will never back away from the Australian ballot&mdash;a compulsory attendance, secret ballot which is the Australian way of voting. We will never accept the Liberals' perversion of our electoral system, a system which Australians are proud of and rightly regard as the best in the world. We will do everything possible to ensure the convention does not become just a device for Mr Howard to smother the republic and rort our electoral system. The first step along the way is to make the ballot for the delegates to the convention a compulsory attendance, secret ballot in the tried and true Australian tradition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak off the cuff about an issue that is extraordinarily important in the history of this country, and that is the opportunity, as we move into the next century and indeed the next millennium and mark the hundredth year of our unity as a country, to upgrade and update our democracy, and to look forward to the sort of democracy we as a society want in a vastly changed world in the 21st century. In the wake of the last election, we have the proposal for a constitutional convention coming from this government and in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say at the outset that the Greens believe that the Constitutional Convention is  a means of empowering the people, rather than the politicians, to formulate the sort of society and indeed the sort of parliament and government that they want to see working for them in the future. At the outset then, it is logical that we stand for a fully elected convention. We are opposed to the government appointing half the delegates. That has echoes of the Indonesian form of democracy, where the government appoints the heart and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the people get to, within restrictions, appoint the other half.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also say at the outset that we believe that this convention should be at least working on an indication of what the people want. It would be logical, it would be sensible, it would be democratically wise and, finally, it would be expedient in terms of the use of public money, were there to be a plebiscite with the election of those delegates for this Constitutional Convention&mdash;which is coming up in August, September or October&mdash;whereby people could vote for a republic or the continuation of a monarchy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then you would have a convention which had a directive&mdash;if the opinion polls are right&mdash;to work on what sort of republic the people of this country want, rather than a convention which is very likely to bog down into a dispute between those on it who feel that the monarchy should be retained and those who feel that we should be making a fresh start and that we are long overdue in this nation to have an Australian as head of state. If that is the outcome, and it is very likely to be, then there is going to be a great deal of wasted time and there is going to be a need for a consequent referendum anyway. Let us have the referendum now with this vote and let the convention get on with the business of formulating the republic, rather than wasting time with a debate on whether or not we should have one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an historic opportunity to turn the constitution from a means of bringing together a disparate group of British colonies strung around the coastline of this great continent, to a means of stating the rights and responsibilities of Australia and, in so doing, charting Australia's role both domestically and globally in the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could do little better than to begin with the Australian ethos of a fair go and consider whether we might not write into the constitution an injunction to all those people who represent Australians in the future, that they should, in the consideration of every matter, not only be thinking of us now but also of those later&mdash;of going back to the wisdom of the indigenous people in this continent and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4377"> around the world, which takes note of those who have come before us as well as those who will be there after us. At the very least, they should ask this question which should, I believe, be across the portals of this parliament: In everything we do, will people 100 years from now thank us for having done it? It is a very simple question, but it is revolutionary in its effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would mean that instead of the expedience of the current economic fundamentalism, the impulsive and self-gratifying line of politics and, indeed, culture that is the hallmark of our current acquisitive and, in many ways, destructive society, we would be on the road back to a caring and long-sighted society which thought about those who come after us and, moreover, acted in their interests. I believe that we cannot really assess a quality of life for ourselves unless it takes into account the quality of life that we are bequeathing and shaping for those who come after us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, if you look at the economic fundamentalism, the materialism, the gross self&hyphen;investment of current society in this country and around the world, you have to be appalled at the short&hyphen;sightedness of it, at the greed and at the lack of concern for those who come after us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week, in the wake of an historic agreement between the state of Victoria and the Prime Minister of this country, I was motivated to go to the forests of Goolengook, the national estate forests in East Gippsland, to see how state and federal governments working together could be providing for that long&hyphen;term interest for future generations, if not for the rights of our fellow creatures on this planet. What I found frankly appalled me. Here we had grand forests, ancient forests, much of which was standing there at the time  the Aboriginal people first sighted Batman and Fawkner, and which, with all its wildlife, is being fed to the chainsaws and bulldozers and shipped out at 20c a tonne to woodchippers making $75 a tonne as the forests are sent on their way to the paper mills, and therefore the rubbish dumps, ultimately, of the Northern Hemisphere.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the simple dictum, if genuinely undertaken in everything we do, not only in parliaments but in boardrooms, in staffrooms, at home and in the neighbourhood, were to be asked in our deliberations, `What will people 100 years from now think of us in what we are doing?', it would radically change the decision making of the variety which allows us to sell for a quick profit ancient forests which ought to be part of the life, the inspiration, the adventure, the wonderment of all future generations of Australians. I feel that, instead of their thanks, we are bequeathing future generations anguish and anger at us for our short&hyphen;sightedness, our greed and our inability to deal with the rapaciousness which so often goes with the thirst for profit in the latter part of the 20th century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an economic rationalist age upon us which needs curbing. We do not have a constitution or a set of laws which is about to do that but we do have an historic opportunity here to stop in our tracks and think about it. I think it would be better if this Constitutional Convention were left to the people and not to elected politicians, and were wholly given across to the representatives of the people and not to half the appointees of the government of the day, if we were to aim to really change for the better the way this country works for future generations and, indeed, the way it works as part of the community of nations in a century which has seen us go from an isolated distant part of the world to a part of a very small inter&hyphen;reactive single community of six billion people on this finite, beautiful little planet that we have inherited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that ought to be looked at in a Constitutional Convention, in this historic opportunity, is a bill of rights, which a majority of Australians support according to opinion polls and which, as a very minimum, ensures that no Australians, no matter how small the minority in which they exist, are subject to discrimination, and a bill of rights which is built upon that ethic of a fair go on which I spoke at the outset. I quote from Mike Salvaris, the Senior Research Fellow at the Swinburne University of Technology in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4378"> Melbourne who made a speech on May Day about the republic and, in part, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Constitutions can contain many important rights and in fact overseas examples show that they do. They can entrench fundamental human rights including all those which Australia has technically signed in international conventions but not implemented. One example: twenty years ago we signed a convention to make post&hyphen;secondary education free and what we've actually done is introduce fees. They can enshrine the right to local government. They can make full employment a mandatory goal of national policy. They can make industrial rights part of our constitutional rights and they can explicitly define rights that are often neglected, such as economic and environmental rights. They can set out the major goals and obligations and goals of key national bodies like the Reserve Bank which without legal direction has become a tool of private banks. They can enshrine our right to public ownership of major public utilities. They can make politicians more accountable and set out basic principles for open and honest government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many Australians believe these things should be included in a constitution. But it seems that the politicians think otherwise. National research in 1993 showed that 70% of Australians support the idea of a Bill of Rights enshrined in the constitution but about the same percentage of coalition parliamentarians actually oppose it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Salvaris goes on to point out towards the end of his speech the extraordinary situation we have on the planet in this heightened age of materialism where there are 358 billionaires who own between them the same as 2&half; billion of the poorest people on this planet. I add to that, that one billion of those people are simply unable to get enough food to put in their bellies or to feed their children, and ensure that their children have the right to grow up and be fulfilled adults and part of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could and should, at the outset, recognise the indigenous people of this nation. We should recognise their prior occupation as the first nation people of Australia with a commitment to their rights and gratitude for the richness and tapestry of their culture which is  imbued in the national tapestry itself and which makes Australia so special, so different and potentially so much wiser than simply draw on those cultures which have been brought to this continent and neglect that special, appropriate and land&hyphen;recognising and related culture of the indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can build into our constitution the concept of global rights and responsibilities.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> After all, we are in a single global community. We forget our obligation to move towards a global democracy, a global constitution and a globally responsive and responsible community of people. We simply leave that role to the multinational corporations, which are unelected, unrepresentative and totally short of the task of reflecting what the six billion people on this planet think, let alone able to understand the plight of the poorest half of the people in the world and indeed the poorest people in our own community in Australia. We could enshrine in that global democracy a simple statement of the tenets of democracy as we see them: one vote for one person and one value for one vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could, of course, recognise in our constitution our obligation to the environment of this wonderful continent of ours&mdash;in particular, our obligation to ensure that it is left the better for our passing and is not serially degraded at record rates as is the case at the moment by each successive term of government, by each successive round of business and by each successive group of people who think that they can leave the problems of environmental degradation on the sideboard for the next generation to pick up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That said, the Greens will be moving amendments to this legislation, which aims to establish a constitutional convention elected in the spring and sitting in December. As I said earlier, we will be aiming specifically to have an indicative plebiscite with the vote so that the convention can work on what sort of republic we want, if that is the wish of the Australian people, rather than get bogged down in a non-productive debate between the monarchists and those who want an Australian as our head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we should ensure that the elections for the Constitutional Convention are conducted similarly to elections for the Senate, including public funding. We will be moving amendments to that effect. I was impressed by Senator Faulkner, who spoke directly before me. Let me say this straight out: there is a move within the conservatives, by the Liberals and the National Party in this country, to get away from compulsory voting, which ensures that everybody's voice is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4379"> heard, at least in the ballot box. It is a move towards giving greater power to those who already have and diminishing the power of those who do not have. It is the thin end of the wedge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The move to simply having non-compulsory postal voting can be seen as downgrading the power of the people in the outcome of a constitutional convention while, at the same time, being an experiment to allow those who want to to change our grand compulsory voting system in this country, ultimately the fairest form of ensuring that everybody votes in future policy moves by governments at state and federal levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, we will be moving amendments to ensure that all delegates to the Constitutional Convention are elected. We do not believe the government should be appointing people. We believe that the people should be totally empowered in so far as this Constitutional Convention is concerned. Why is it that governments cannot trust the people? Why is it that it is considered that 150 or so delegates are not available out there in the ranks of we 18 million and more Australians to bring a fresh, new view to the way our constitution should be shaped? It is because there is fear that the security we have in this now century&hyphen;old system, which vastly needs reforming, will be changed and that we as individuals will lose out. We should do better than that and put our trust in the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, we will be moving amendments to ensure that the information that goes out from candidates about this important Constitutional Convention election vote is available in a language which people understand. For communities that have more than five per cent of people who do not speak English, it will be up to those who are standing in the election&mdash;and this will be available to them if our  amendments succeed&mdash;to print material in the languages of those people so that they clearly understand what they are voting for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, we will be moving amendments to ensure that the Constitutional Convention, a gathering of elected people, can set its own agenda, can move beyond the agenda set by the government and can hasten and broaden
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the process as we move towards the new century. I think it would be a good thing if Greens policy, for example, for proportional representation in our house of government, the House of Representatives, were adopted. It would more clearly reflect, as the Senate does, the wish of the people rather than simply having a system which determines which of the big parties is set to govern. We would have greater plurality and more parties and independents in our parliament. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1897 and 1898 Australians from all colonies except Queensland gathered in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne to hold the constitutional conventions that led Australia down the historic path to federation. The founding fathers did so in a spirit which, despite the many divisions that existed in their respective home colonies, had at its core the belief that they were involved in the task of nation&hyphen;building, of shaping the form that a new Australian federation would take. It was a task that they took on regardless of their personal views as to whether the Australian colonies should take the final step towards nationhood. A century later, this government has no such vision and no such spirit. It has designed a process for constitutional reform based on fear. It is a process that is designed to pull Australians apart, not one designed to bring them together. It is a process that will entrench division, rather than promote the consensus that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) claims he wants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than embrace and consider change in an open and constructive way, this government and, in particular, this Prime Minister have been dragged into adopting a process for constitutional reform that is, and has been, all about avoiding the very reform that it sought. Have no doubt about this: this is a process designed to alienate Australians from both the process and the outcome. It is designed to minimise their involvement so that this government can, at the end of the day, disregard and discredit the genuine desire that an overwhelming proportion of Australians have to resolve this issue. It seeks to take from the hands of ordinary Australians the decision
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4380"> they most want to make and one that they should make themselves: that is, whether we, as Australians, have the right to aspire to the highest office in the land&mdash;whether we want to become a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no denying that this proposal for a people's convention is not the Labor Party's preferred means of achieving the republic. We believe that the best way to do this is to put this decision straight into the hands of the Australian people through an indicative plebiscite and, ultimately, through a referendum. Realistically, however, a people's convention is the only immediately available option that we have, and those of us who unequivocally support the republic believe that we should try to make it work. That is why we give some support to this bill and that is why we give some support to a people's convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But our support is not unconditional. The government have sought, in this bill, to abuse the desire that the overwhelming majority of Australians hold: that Australia should become a republic. They have contrived a poisonous bill designed to undermine many of the fundamental democratic institutions and principles of fairness that we, and the overwhelming majority of Australians, believe in. To the government we say, `We won't be party to your despicable attempts to subvert the democratic principles upon which this nation is based.' Accordingly, we will be seeking to make changes to this bill&mdash;changes to make the convention democratic, fairer and more reflective of community opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's response to date to our more than reasonable demands has been childish and petulant, to say the least. The government has threatened to ignore our amendments upon the return of this bill to the House. It has threatened to return the bill in its original form to the Senate in the belief  that we will buckle as a result of our desire to see the convention proceed. I say to the government that it needs to reconsider its standover tactics. We will not accept an abridgment of the amendments that will be passed by the Senate to the bill. Why? It is not because we are stubborn or unreasonable, but because we believe that democracy in this
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nation is not, and must never be, a tradeable commodity. There are certain basic standards in our democracy that simply are not negotiable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government ultimately choose to ignore the will of the Senate, if they refuse to accept our democratic amendments and refuse to proceed with the convention&mdash;or proceed with a fully appointed convention&mdash;then it is the government alone that will be to blame. They will have to explain to the Australian people why they have not kept their promise, why they do not want a fair, open and democratic discussion of whether Australia should become a republic. Let me reiterate: the Labor Party is not keen to take part in a process that is ultimately designed to destroy the very ideals that we strive for. If the decision that Australians make on whether to become a republic or not is to be adjudged as fair dinkum, then it is critical that the process to get us there also be fair dinkum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is where our concerns about this bill begin. You only have to look at recent political history to see why this bill is before us in its present form. What brought it here? It is no secret that in 1994 the then Leader of the Opposition, Alexander Downer, was in a pickle. The coalition was unable to resolve its internal squabbling over the republic. When this Prime Minister took over&mdash;this Prime Minister who is a renowned monarchist&mdash;when he inherited the leadership, the idea of a people's convention served him well as a means to neutralise the politically damaging issue of the republic, and what it had become within his own party. But he did not embrace the idea of a people's convention because he wanted to embrace the discussion on constitutional reform. Once again, it was a means of avoiding the destructive internal party infighting and the damaging political effect it had on both him personally and the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole concept of a people's convention has been poisoned since its inception. It has been contrived in fear and timidity, not in hope or vision. Rather than a means for considered deliberation of constitutional reform, it has always been a means for the coalition to avoid making a decision on this
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4381"> issue. When, earlier this year, the Prime Minister decided to push ahead with the convention to keep his election promise, it was, once again, not because he was prepared to consider change, but rather because he feared what would happen if he was seen to be resisting that change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the founding fathers of a century ago who embraced the processes of change, and who led this nation to federation, this Prime Minister fears change and refuses to lead. This is a weak and sneaky bill and it reeks of the Prime Minister's fear of tackling the republican issue head on. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Prime Minister's second reading speech. In a speech where he could have outlined his vision for Australia's future, our destiny, our place in the world, what did he do? He did what he always does on the big issues; he equivocates and runs for cover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only in the first and the last paragraphs of his speech did he describe the nature of the choice to be put before the people's convention, and then only in a formal way. Yet he devoted some three paragraphs to discussing both his and the government's reluctance to change our constitutional framework. In the remaining 18 paragraphs&mdash;some 78 per cent of his speech&mdash;he described in mind&hyphen;numbing detail such amazing relevancies as whether the ballot papers would be bar coded, the size of the ballot paper and whether appeal processes under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 would apply. This is the extent of the leadership and vision of our Prime Minister. He cannot see further than the most convenient bar code. No&hyphen;one expected a Gettysburg Address&mdash;least of all from this Prime Minister&mdash;but the Australian people did expect, and did deserve, something better than this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This lack of leadership, vision and courage manifests itself in just about every clause in  this bill. The whole thing is designed to leave the government with a way out. How? Firstly, this bill is undemocratic. It is a dangerous experiment in voluntary voting and it does seek to disenfranchise millions of ordinary Australians by ensuring that as few of them as possible express their views on this import
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ant issue. Secondly, because the government has sought to defy convention, it has sought to rig the appointed delegates to the convention&mdash;especially the parliamentary delegates&mdash;to favour the coalition. In doing so, once again, it seeks to prevent consensus, the test that the Prime Minister himself has laid down for determining the convention's success. Finally, because the government has failed to set up a framework through which the convention can undertake its deliberations, once again we have failure on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the Labor Party could try to walk away from such a weak and sneaky bill, but we do not. The approach that we have taken is to seek to amend the bill to make it democratic, workable and fair. We want to give the Australian people every opportunity to send a loud and clear message to the Prime Minister&mdash;that is, if he is not going to lead on this issue, he should get out of their way. We will do this by moving amendments which empower ordinary Australians and make the process democratic. That will help them to express their opinions on the issue and it will make this process fair and democratic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless this bill is changed, it can be fairly said that over seven million Australians probably will not vote and close to three million people will have difficulty voting. Most of these will have enormous difficulty receiving their voting package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the government's contempt for the Australian people on this issue, the first indication is its embracing of a voluntary postal ballot to elect delegates to the convention. If a voluntary postal ballot is held, it will be the first time in a Commonwealth election, plebiscite or referendum that an issue will have been determined by this means. The government, in arguing to support this approach, argues the question of costs. The government, for instance, is currently arguing that a voluntary postal ballot will cost approximately $35&half; million compared to $49 million for a compulsory attendance ballot. These figures are rubbery. These costings are based on false assumptions. Unfortunately, I do not have time to go through all the false assumptions, but there are some that are stark and unbelievable and they cannot be ignored.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4382">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, for instance, is proposing to mail out to every elector information about the convention, providing details of the election, how to vote, details of each and every one of the candidates who have nominated and a couple of envelopes. This package will also include the most important document of all&mdash;the ballot paper. Although no-one is precisely sure how many candidates will run, in New South Wales, for instance, it has been estimated that there could be anywhere between 200 and 500 candidates. Not surprisingly, these envelopes will have to carry a considerable amount of information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Naturally enough, you would expect that the government's costings would be based on sending out this information in a decent sized envelope. If you presume that, you would be wrong. The government proposes to send all this information out in one ordinary sized envelope. Even Aladdin's genie would have had trouble fitting into that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More realistically though, the government would have to send out this information in a package that is more approximately the size of a tax pack. Were they to do this&mdash;I believe that if this bill is not amended, within 48 hours, they would make such a decision&mdash;such an extra cost would cost the government $8 million alone. So in one fell swoop the cost differential between a compulsory attendance ballot and a manifestly inferior voluntary postal ballot will fall far from the government's claimed $13&half; million to $5&half; million. There are some other cost cuts that I will go to later on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other than highlighting the government's duplicity over this issue, a more important principle is at stake. Unlike the government, we on this side of the parliament believe that the cost of democracy has never been an issue and should not be one now. Secondly, the government has also argued that Australians should not be compelled to vote at a ballot for a convention that is not binding. Yet the convention will be binding to the extent that its recommendations will form the model of the republic that will ultimately be put to the people at a referendum.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, voluntary postal voting sits uncomfortably with the Prime Minister's commitment before the election. It is another breach of commitment. Before the election he made this commitment to consult all Australians at the beginning, the middle and the end of this process. How can we truly describe this as a people's convention unless all Australians participate in the process and unless all Australians have an equal capacity to so participate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Howard&hyphen;Minchin proposal for a voluntary postal ballot, not all Australians will. For instance, the Australian Electoral Commission has admitted that up to two million Australians change their address each year. Since this ballot will be held some 18 months from the last federal election&mdash;in fact, some two years from the last full habitation review&mdash;more than three million people may not receive a ballot paper simply because they have not notified the commission of their change of address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, material about the ballot will only be available in writing and in English. This is likely to disenfranchise many of those Australians who are blind, the frail aged, the illiterate or those whose language skills are not of sufficiently high standard. Two and a half million Australians come from a non-English speaking background. Most of these people are currently assisted through their attendance at polling booths or the use of mobile polling booths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue was that of people overseas. Only after pressure from the Labor Party on this issue has the government allowed the ballot paper to be distributed to approximately 200,000 Australians who are likely to be overseas at the time of the ballot. That is going to cost another $1&half; million or so and that is a considerable reduction on that differential of $5&half; million. Together with extra savings that we believe can be made by staggering the counting of the ballot, the differential comes to some $2 million or $3 million, nowhere near the government's initial claim of some $18 million or so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A voluntary vote is likely to be used by those within the government, such as Senator
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4383"> Minchin, to support their ultimate desire to see a voluntary voting system introduced at federal elections. We saw evidence of this just this week through the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in the 1996 election. Unfortunately for the government, some 72 per cent of Australians disagree with any such move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us face it, the history of voluntary postal votes in this country&mdash;a system that has been used primarily for local council and trade union elections&mdash;is not good. Recent experience in Victoria and South Australia is testament to that. Although there are rare instances where voluntary postal ballots attract some 60 per cent or more return, the more usual figure is a 30 to 40 per cent turnout. Such a return here will be used by some to discredit any message sent by the electorate through its preference for pro-republican or pro-monarchist candidates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the opinion polls are right and some 60 per cent of Australians who do vote vote for pro-republican candidates, the monarchists will try to claim, as I predict they will, that only 36 per cent of the total Australian population supports a republic. On this basis, they will then try to argue that there is no clear consensus in favour of a republic. If a more likely 35 to 40 per cent turnout is achieved, they would say that only 24 per cent voted for the republic and, as a consequence, there is less support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example of this distorted behaviour has already been demonstrated by the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), a leading monarchist, who, in the most recent edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Adelaide Review</EMPHASIS>, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even if republican candidates win two-thirds of the vote in the election for delegates . . . that still leaves the Convention `do you want a Republic' vote at about 88 to 64 which is hardly a `consensus' or even a particularly overwhelming majority for change.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, even if there is 66 per cent support for a republic in the electorate, as reflected through this ballot, the government already is position ing itself to argue that that is insufficient for a consensus. That is from a government which, on the back of one vote, is willing to claim consensus in the Senate for major
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> changes that affect the lives of citizens every day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must also say that, if you do want a bipartisan position here, the dynamic of a voluntary ballot is flawed. It encourages political opponents to spend time drumming up support amongst their own supporters rather than amongst the general community, particularly those yet to make up their minds. If the PM is serious about building a consensus among the Australian people, either for or against the republic, then it is the middle&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;road swinging voter who must be convinced to vote one way or another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we do have problems with the voluntary voting proposal. Of course, we will move amendments to it. We also have immense problems with the secrecy aspects of the proposal. We contend very strongly&mdash;I think the evidence is there to support our contention&mdash;that, in a four&hyphen;week ballot where the ballot paper will be floating around for public and not so private access, there will be enormous pressure on the secrecy of the ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not satisfied with the security proposals put forward by the government. The proposals depend on the date of birth as the major security measure in identifying the person who voted. Given the prevalence of availability of dates of birth to a whole range of people, including nursing home owners, flat owners and employers, we do not believe that the security measures are adequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have problems with the voting system. The government misleadingly says that they have adopted the Senate style voting system, though what they have put up is absolutely nothing like it. What is above the line is nothing like what is above the line in the Senate voting system, and what will be below the line is also nothing like what is normally below the line in the Senate system. The government's defence in respect of this, which I will go to in the committee stage of the bill, is one which I think is demeaning to the Australian democratic system. If you wanted to ensure that as many Australians as possible were confused or excluded from the system, then you could not have come up with a better proposal than the one that the government has come up with.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4384">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also concerned with the process of the appointment of delegates to the people's convention. Despite the fact that they will make up half the convention, and thus be highly influential in its deliberations, we have only the Prime Minister's word that appointments will occur in the manner which is described in the second reading speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say at this late stage that, if the government was interested in bipartisanship, they would not have sent out letters to their appointments to the convention today and in a manner which was non&hyphen;consultative with the parliament. They knew there was a proposal coming up to ensure that the parliament had a bipartisan approach to the selection of those appointed delegates. They have seen our amendments for some time, but they chose to pre&hyphen;empt, in a very divisive way, the consideration of the Senate of those amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence, today they notified a group of people that they will be the appointed delegates to the convention. We say to the government that our proposed amendment still has relevance, and we will pursue that, together with amendments, to provide a fair balance.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the way this government has chosen to implement that commitment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997 is not about providing the mechanisms for a fair, reasonable and inclusive debate on Australia's future. Far from it, we say. This bill is essentially about two things. Firstly, it is about allowing the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), whom we know is openly opposed to the concept of a republic, by a combination of ownership of appointments and ownership of the formulae for representation, to engineer, to stage manage, to manipulate&mdash;in other words, to stack&mdash;the Constitutional Convention in favour of his desired outcome. Secondly, this bill is an illegitimate, Liberal Party driven, Nick Minchin inspired, ideological experiment in voluntary voting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are fortunate, I might say, that the debate on this bill has coincided so neatly with the tabling on Monday of the report of the inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the conduct of the 1996 federal election, because that report revealed very clearly the agenda of some in this government with respect to voluntary voting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no secret that the Democrats, like others, would have preferred an indicative plebiscite to gauge the feeling of the Australian people on this issue prior to the expenditure of millions of dollars on what has the potential to become a celebrity talkfest. What is the point of holding a convention before the views of the Australian people on the fundamental question about whether we want to have an Australian head of state are ascertained? What we are faced with now is a potentially divisive, expensive and, most of all, overly complicated constitutional convention grudgingly offered by the Prime Minister in response to former Prime Minister Keating's republican timetable and framework announcements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats could have lived with a constitutional convention. We could have tolerated it because it was clearly the only option available to us under this coalition government. They were honouring their commitment, and it seemed a reasonable compromise.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4385">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that was before the government began to politicise the whole event. That was before Senator Minchin and the Prime Minister started to inject their own political and electoral agenda into this important debate about Australia's future as a nation. I do question the motives behind the finer detail of this bill, and I do question Senator Minchin's assertions that the departures in this bill from normal electoral practice are only the result of budgetary restraint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has provided in this bill for a non-compulsory postal ballot. This is a monumental departure from the time&hyphen;honoured Australian practice of compulsory attendance voting, and it is a departure to which we are strongly opposed. Is the Prime Minister trying to suggest that electing delegates at a constitutional convention, designed to discuss the very shape of our nation in the 21st century, is any less important or any less significant than an election to determine who will be your federal, local or state member of parliament? I think a lot of Australians would strongly disagree with the implication behind the Prime Minister's view of why we can have voluntary voting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal Australians, people from remote and rural areas, the elderly, the disabled, Australians of non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds and Australians with learning disabilities should all be very worried about the precedent being set here. There are innumerable foreseeable and unforeseeable problems associated with the conduct of a postal ballot, and Senator Bolkus clearly articulated many of those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should pay attention to the fact that more than two million Australians change address each year. They will not receive a ballot paper if they have not informed the Electoral Commission of their change of address&mdash;and, as I recall it, they only get a week to do that in this process before the roles close&mdash;nor will the hundreds of thousands of Australians who happen to be travelling overseas at the time of the election. They  would normally vote in an overseas polling booth. On this occasion, they will not have the opportunity.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A postal vote conducted in English only will effectively disenfranchise those from non-English speaking backgrounds. It will disenfranchise those with literacy problems, the blind and the aged because, at a normal election, these people would receive assistance at polling booths or mobile polling booths. This kind of assistance will not be available to that extent at this election, although the Electoral Commission have indicated they will provide assistance via an 013 free call line. But you have to know it exists to ring it, and you have to know how to read English to find out that this facility is available to you. I do acknowledge that the Electoral Commission have said they are going to advertise in 11 languages. I think that is welcome, but I do not think it overcomes the fundamental problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the government's calculations, a postal vote instead of a normal attendance vote would save&mdash;although it is a bit hard to estimate&mdash;around $18 million. If you look at that in the starkest terms, we would be paying less than a dollar for every Australian towards having the most democratic opportunity to debate probably one of the most important questions facing our country and its government&mdash;that is, its relationship with its citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard the government say that we are obsessed with compulsion. I say that this government is obsessed with implementing an electoral system which ensures that the Liberal Party advantages itself in future electoral contests and retains its status as the ruling party within the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin wants voluntary voting in all elections&mdash;federal and state. Compulsory voting, according to him, `has contributed to the depth of cynicism, apathy and ignorance in the political process'. Not only is it `a fundamental breach of the civil liberties of individuals in a liberal democracy', but it has `damaged the Australian political process' and `weakened the political parties'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What rubbish. To suggest that government is not the concern of all citizens is an absolute furphy. To suggest that compulsory voting is the route of cynicism and apathy in the political process is just plain dishonest and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4386"> manipulative. But bad workmen always blame their tools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to hear the explanation offered by psephologist Malcolm Mackerras on ABC radio in Canberra this morning. He suggested that the Liberal Party, after 13 years in opposition, has developed a great big chip on its shoulder and wants to change the system to benefit itself but is not willing to be honest about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a pity that the idea of a peoples convention has been hijacked by Senator Minchin's particular obsession with voluntary voting. I am sure if you asked Petro Georgiou, if you asked Senator Alan Eggleston&mdash;although we know what his views are&mdash;if you asked the Liberal Party federal executive, if you asked a range of Liberal Party state directors and if you asked the National Party, some of them would tell you they think it is a great pity too and they are opposed to what is happening with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some support for Senator Minchin from others but it is purely political self&hyphen;interest. They rely on research that shows that the Liberal vote would increase if voter turnout decreased. According to a news poll in February 1996, if voting were made voluntary at least 19 per cent of Labor voters but only 14 per cent of coalition voters would be likely not to vote at all. Malcolm Mackerras said this morning that surveys such as this one translate into a two per cent swing to the right. How convenient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Research does not demonstrate, however, that a decline in voter participation would advantage the National Party and I am sure they are paying close attention to this debate. In fact, the abolition of compulsory voting in any election is against National Party policy. I suspect that National Party candidates were prominent among the 24 per cent of coalition candidates who indicated strong support for compulsory voting in the 1996 candidate survey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are very strong arguments for retaining compulsory voting in this election and in all elections in Australia. It has been the norm. It is not that you do not want change  but there are sometimes very good reasons for preserving things that work well and reflect
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> history. To a great extent, compulsory voting says something about the Australian character. We like having to be focused and forced to go along and make a choice. We are not asked to do it very often. It has been the norm since 1924, having been introduced to combat voter turnout as low as 58 per cent in the 1922 election. The rationale for its introduction was expressed by the independent senator who moved the Commonwealth Electoral Bill as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Claiming to be a democratic community we naturally expect the people of Australia to be sufficiently interested in the constitution of the national parliament to see that it is thoroughly representative of political thought in electoral divisions. Parliament is supposed to be a reflex of the mind of the people. If people exhibit no interest in the selection of their representatives, it must necessarily follow, in the course of time that there must be a considerable deterioration in the nature of the laws governing the social and economic development in the country.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that statement still holds true. Compulsory voting is accepted by Australians as a national tradition. Australians accept that it is their duty to vote and in the main they do so on a Saturday, usually at their local primary or high school, more often than not in a spirit of willing participation and community spirit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Voting provides most of these people with a sense that, on this occasion, what they are doing matters. Their vote counts. A man said to me recently, in response to all these arguments about mainstream Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you know who mainstream Australia is? They are the people who have no power, no say in what goes on in their country, no form of redress if they are unhappy, except for their vote at the polls.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think compulsory voting ensures the expression of choice of all those who are eligible to vote, not just those who choose to vote. A compulsory vote will ensure that, as far as is possible, the delegates are elected according to the wishes of all citizens. I think compulsory voting assists in legitimising the entire electoral process and it gives authority and ownership to the outcome. I note from recent AAP reports that even Fiji's Prime Minister is now committing to the introduction of compulsory voting in his plans for constitutional reform.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4387">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats say: `Yes, let's have a convention if that is how you honour your commitment, but let's make it a proper peoples convention by ensuring that all Australians are given the opportunity and encouragement to participate.' Conducting a voluntary postal ballot with a ballot paper requiring a PhD to decipher it does not encourage people to vote; in our view it turns them away. We have spent millions of dollars since 1984 educating Australians on how to cast a formal vote in a normal Senate election. We have done reasonably well in that quest. Why overturn that now? Why introduce, overnight, a confusing competing process?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very important debate. This is about the future of Australia and all Australians should be encouraged to participate, if not directly by putting themselves forward for election or appointment, then by being present and attending a polling booth on the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This convention represents, according to Michelle Grattan of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> `a return to politics on the cheap'. I will defer to her vast experience on the matter of a `return' to politics on the cheap, but certainly if cost is the government's rationale for holding a voluntary postal ballot instead of the compulsory attendance ballot, as is the norm, then this is indeed politics on the cheap. But I do not think it is cost; I think it is a much more sinister longer term agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn to the issue of equality of representation of women in the parliament and to women in positions of power generally and say that we believe women should be given encouragement to actively participate in this debate; that is, in the convention. The Prime Minister has promised to ensure a proper balance between men and women at the convention and Senator Minchin has indicated his own preference for a 50&hyphen;50 representation. We welcome this and urge the government to abide by its promise. Will this be reflected, for example, in the fact that 50 per cent of the government's appointed delegates will be women?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think we need to go further and to legislate to ensure that women candidates are
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> given proper exposure and that there are an equal number of them there to be chosen. There were no women at the Australasian federal conventions in the late 19th century. Women's representation in parliaments across Australia is still an average of 20 per cent. Twenty per cent to represent 52 per cent of the population is just not acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats do not support quotas, and we would not support the implementation of quotas in this situation, but we do believe that to require those setting up group voting tickets in the election to have half their candidates as women is one way to address gender inequity, and we will be moving an amendment to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As this is essentially a single&hyphen;issue poll where candidates are, for the most part, either for or against the question, we think candidates for election, as well as appointees, should be required to indicate where they stand on the issue. We will be moving an amendment to ensure that candidates are required to declare this at the time of nomination. Even if they want to say, `Well, I am on the fence on this one,' we think voters choosing them should have the right to know this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also urge the Prime Minister to require appointees to publicly declare their point of view prior to the close of nominations for the election. I think this is a protection against deliberate stacking of the processes by those who would be trying to hide their particular position from the general public. The Democrats are avid republicans. We do not believe Australia as a democratic and modern nation should have as its head of state a person who lives in another country and whose legal and constitutional position in relation to us is inherited. In our view, those who advocate the status quo support a technical subservience to a group of people who are not elected and who did not earn their place through endeavour or merit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We view this debate as the ideal opportunity for the people of Australia to explore the important question of what sort of nation we want to become in the next century. This will be our second century as a federation. Do we want to retain a legal attachment, even if only symbolic, to the British Crown, when the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4388"> sentimental attachment has long since faded? I do not think we do, but then I do not believe Australia should move into the next stage of our history under a cloud of illegitimacy because the Constitutional Convention issued its verdict amidst allegations of stacking and experimentation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We understand the Prime Minister's concern to ensure a proper balance in representation, so that indigenous people, women, migrants, youth and people from rural and remote areas are properly represented. But, rather than the Prime Minister appointing the 36 non&hyphen;parliamentary delegates, we think he should have allowed for the federal parliament to make the appointments via the committee process or through some other mechanism. That again would protect the convention from allegations of stacking. I do not think the spoils of victory extend to the right to make the appointments on every single statutory authority or convention or public body in existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also agree that state and federal parliamentarians should have an input, but we question the formula used by the Prime Minister to decide on the number of delegates to be chosen by each federal party and from each state. Under the Prime Minister's formula, the coalition will have 25 parliamentary representatives at the convention and the ALP will have only 13. An Australian republic will persist beyond the current political arrangement of a coalition majority, and a Prime Minister with foresight and a sense of fair play would have acknowledged that. We question the formula used by the government to determine the number of delegates to be elected from each state and territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I express my regret that the government has chosen to use this debate as a political device. Ideally, a move to a republic would have been a unifying experience, not a cause for finger pointing or experimentation in voting techniques. If the government spit the dummy and say that it is voluntary voting or no convention, then we are entitled to ask: how committed were they really? In fact, they might be secretly very relieved if  the convention does not go ahead, because then they will not have to proceed with the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> next step of giving Australians a say in an indicative plebiscite.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In preparation for tonight's debate, I read through the second reading speech for this bill, the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997. It is not called the republican convention; it is called the Constitutional Convention. I notice that the government representatives often call it the republican convention, but it is actually called the Constitutional Convention, which would, I imagine, generally make people believe that what is going to be discussed is the constitution. This is wrong, but that is their opinion. The second reading speech says:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but has decided that on balance, this convention should deal only with the question of a change to a republican form of government.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is conscious of the advocacy of other proposed constitutional changes within the community, and will consider ways in which the government can facilitate sensible consideration of the more significant of these proposals.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I see a very strong thought control in this process. Once the government gets together a group of people who have been selected and elected, what means will it use then to try to control their thoughts? We have seen a lot of thought control lately. We have seen community bodies who have worked their rear ends off to do service to the community, to provide information where governments often do not provide information, to be able to provide things which can be of great use to the community and which also often save money&mdash;save money in crisis care, in crisis
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4389"> management, in all sorts of things. We have seen groups like that in recent times have their funds cut or threatened to be cut for the terrible crime of speaking out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With all of the control mechanisms that are available within this bill and within the selection process, if you get that many people together and, lo and behold, either the government or certain members of the government are not able to control the thought process of that many people in one group at one time, what means are they going to use to try to control the outcome considering it says in particular `which republic model' and `in what time frame'? What if, for instance, the government actually allows them to meet&mdash;another way of trying to control not only their thoughts but the thoughts of the Senate&mdash;for 10 days in December this year and they decide they cannot develop their own model of what other people should think or decide on and they need to go out to the community, they need to ask the government to fund a process of going out to the community to discuss what other people want, what the community in general would like to see develop into Australia's constitution in the next century?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will the government do to try to control that outcome? After all that, will they then say, `That's not what we really wanted.' Will they then accept that decision? Will they accept that some people might still be able to think for themselves despite the efforts to control the outcome? I just wonder. I note at the end of the first page of the second reading speech it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Balanced and easily understood information on the issues will be prepared and distributed widely before the election of delegates.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I also note there is a very limited amount of time that the actual delegates will be able to give out their own information. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That material will explain, in plain English,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">let us pretend that no other languages are spoken in Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">how the existing constitutional system operates. It will identify the arguments for and against change.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Can the candidates not speak for themselves? The government also wants to control this
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> process of what people believe they are going to be deciding upon so it will approach the Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy and the Australian Republican Movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So already we have decided that we are dealing with a minimalist option: do we have an Australian head of state or not? I think Senator Brown's idea of having an indicative plebiscite before the election is a good idea. That means that we can already do that simple stage of saying, `In general, do you think that Australia should have an Australian as a head of state?' We can get that issue out of the way. It does not bind anybody, but it gives everybody an idea of whether or not they are working in the right direction or not, and then you can get onto the really interesting things. That is, if Australians in the majority do believe that we should have an Australian as a head of state, what kind of country do we want to live in in the next century?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are we going to do? Do you think it is going to be right to simply change the head of state and assume that people are going to be happy with a constitution that was put together with all the best of intentions over 100 years ago? Are there not a number of people in our community who know that there are issues about the roles of states, the roles of local governments, the roles of federal government, the roles of courts, whether or not we have freedom of speech, whether or not there should be a bill of rights and, instead of handballing environmental destruction from one government to another, whether or not we have ecological sustainability as a right of citizenship? If you ask young people, that seems to be on the top of their agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do we forget about those concerns? Do we go into something that could be exciting, creative and inclusive or do we try to stifle debate and perhaps punish those people who lobby? If there are any funds going to any groups who may have an opinion on this, perhaps they will get a little letter saying, `If you don't be quiet, we're going to cut your funds too.' Is this what we are going to get by way of a debate? Is this what we are getting at the moment? Is this what should be ringing bells in our heads that perhaps we
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4390"> should have other rights built into our constitution because we can see quite clearly that some of those rights are being threatened as we speak?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we have a situation where the majority of the Senate supports the views of many people in the community that the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill, not the Republican Convention (Election) Bill, ought to be changed and altered, as we have the right and the responsibility to do for any bill that we are dealing with, what do we do if the government picks up its toys and goes home? What kind of representation is this if the government says, `No, we understand we ought to be looking as if we're doing something but, if you change it in any way to actually do something to make this more inclusive, we're not going to do it.' How long can any government stand out?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What would happen to Australia if the United Kingdom moved to change its head of state and Australia was left with a constitutional monarchy&mdash;that is, a constitutional monarchy without a monarch. We have to start thinking about this issue. We have to be grown-up about it. We cannot say, `There is no law, there is no constitutional ability, for this government to say, "You may not change this bill because it is about the Constitutional Convention."' No announcement was ever made to say that there was one section of laws which cannot be altered by the Senate&mdash;that is, anything to do with constitutional debates or debates in relation to a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a backlash if there is an attempt to try to gag the community's concerns and gag the legitimate role of the Senate in trying to bring the community concerns to the parliament. If the majority of the Senate votes for changes to this bill to make it more inclusive, what kind of basis would any government use to say, `This form of bill cannot be amended and should not be amended. So there'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of people&mdash;and I would have to include myself very strongly amongst those&mdash;who believe that we are at a very exciting point in history. That exciting point  is the opportunity to look back over the last 100 years. We can look at the things that have
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> gone right, the things that we have learnt, and we can see what we want as a nation for at least the next century. We want to see the values in Australia, but at the same time we can see that values in general are being ridden roughshod over by some totally undemocratic force in relation to international corporations via the World Trade Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have never been under so much threat. The sovereignty of Australia and many other nations has never been under so much threat. In my opinion, there has never been a period of greater need to think about what we as a country deserve to have as constitutional rights. There has never been a greater need to make sure that whatever process we take to go towards that goal is as inclusive as possible. It is totally wrong for me as a politician to consider that my view is any more important than anybody else's. I have the opportunity to speak in parliament but other people do not. They could try to speak through their politicians but often do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to know, therefore, how we got to a situation where the government decided that there were going to be nominated candidates, they set closing dates for nominations but, ironically, the nominations were never opened. Who saw the ads in the paper asking the general public to think about who they thought would be good to be their nominees? Who saw that ad? Guess what, there wasn't one&mdash;not that I know of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there was a closing date for nominations but they were not ever opened. Who was able to make those nominations? Who knows? Where were the guidelines? Who knows? There weren't any. I did not see any. I asked for them and I was told that there weren't any. This is a private club with no written guidelines. But, obviously, some people must have known the rules. So we will have to wait with bated breath to see who is part of that private club.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have mentioned before that there might be a spread of groups represented, but we have no indication whatsoever of how that might occur. Parliamentarians know&mdash;and there are quite a few that might be a part of this process&mdash;that the government says it does not wish to be prescriptive. So there is a fairly
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4391"> large chunk of this selected group for which there is no process to make sure that half the population&mdash;by way of women&mdash;is represented. How can you make sure that in this process there is a fair representation of non-English speaking people who have taken Australia as their home or of Aboriginal people for whom this is an extremely important debate or of young people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do we know that we will not get a group like the Prime Minister's daughter and his daughter's friends and those people who all have a particular upbringing, a particular viewpoint of what they want in life and a particular outlook? How do we know that we will not get a group of conservative young people or a group of monarchists amongst Aboriginal representatives? How do we know that amongst the selected group we will get any range of opinions represented at all? The answer is that we do not know because the process is not open, it is not free. The only indication I have had that there will be anything other than autocratic decision making is that the names will be run by the Leader of the Opposition. We do not know who is on the short list. We do not know if there is a short list. We do not know if there is a long list. We do not know how many people and what kind of process people went through to put those names forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is a pretty good indication that things are going to be difficult and very much controlled. We also know that amongst our elected representatives, as Senator Kernot indicated, we have about one in five who are women&mdash;and that has gone up in recent times. Female representation in the Australian parliament has been one of the worst representations of the western world. If you were to take that alone, how would you then make up the difference amongst the other selected candidates? What would the government be doing? The answer is that we do not know what will be happening. Perhaps they will just say, `We will take the representation as it is in parliament.' What does that mean for that half of the population who feel that they are not being fully represented by those people who are attending the Constitutional Convention?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As always, I would like to see that such a Constitutional Convention may just have the hope of bringing something positive, may just have the hope of not being totally controlled in its outcomes. I very much doubt it, but I would like to think that there are enough people in the community who are concerned about the outcomes to make sure that good, representative people from a wide range of opinions are elected to the Constitutional Convention. I would like to hope&mdash;and it might be a faint hope&mdash;that some people who have a mind of their own and who are not going to be cowed by those people who want the debate to be as quiet as possible, as limited as possible and with no threat to the current constitutional monarchy, will escape into the system amongst the selected delegates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to think that the range of opinions that exist amongst the coalition will be represented. I think it is a pity that there is such a great parliamentary contingent of this delegation. It is also a pity that the chair and the vice chair have automatically been selected from politicians. So there is already an assumption that what we will have is a political agenda. It is such a pity to think that we cannot have a situation where the delegates from that Constitutional Convention could elect their own chair. It does not bode well for their ability to make other decisions without direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How much direction will be given by the government during this process? What notice will be taken if, by sheer accident, the Constitutional Convention ends up being represented by people with a range of opinions who can speak for themselves, who actually want to see changes to our system, who believe that just changing the head of state without looking at the other things that go with it does not mean a lot if people really believe it is important that Australia becomes a republic?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps it is a good thing to think about the indicative plebiscite and get that through&mdash;and do it, as has been suggested, by compulsory voting, because we all know very well that those who have a lot of money benefit from non-compulsory voting. If you have to get people to go out of their houses to vote in an
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4392"> Australian election&mdash;or even to go to the effort of putting in an envelope to vote&mdash;the ability to have access to paid media, to advertisements and so on, is obviously very important. We also know that the reality is that even now there is limited ownership of the Australian press and that a total range of opinions is not always possible within our media. So it is important that we see that there is compulsory voting, to make sure that everybody participates in a very important decision. Otherwise the government is saying, `This is not as important as other decisions.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to have compulsory voting&mdash;which I very much hope we are&mdash;we should have the indicative plebiscite and then get on to the important issues: how we go about this and what kind of republican model we choose. I would like to read that as broadly as possible. And perhaps, instead of having a group&mdash;however good&mdash;of Constitutional Convention delegates deciding what the rest of Australia should decide, we should make sure that enough people contact those delegates and say, `We want a say too.' Let us take it back to the community, before you ask us further about anything that binds Australia in relation to the republican debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

I have a long held belief that Australia should become a republic. In 1981, within my party in Western Australia&mdash;and I made mention of this in my first speech in this place&mdash;I was instrumental in moving a motion at a special state conference that later became our policy at a special national conference of my party. That policy has held up until today.

I hope the same thing happens on this occasion; I hope this proposed Constitutional Convention will die a death in this place&mdash;or very soon after it leaves this place.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party's position on this bill is very clearly on the record, particularly so from the contribution made by my colleague, Senator Bolkus, here this evening, but also as Senator Bolkus and I participated in the deliberations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. I commend the report from that committee to those that are interested in this particular debate. I particularly commend the minority report of the Labor Party senators and, indeed, the minority report from the Democrat senator, Senator Murray. The concerns are widespread about this piece of legislation. They trawl the whole area of community concerns about what the government proposes in this bill, not
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the least of which is the impact and effect of what a postal ballot would do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee heard evidence that the bill discriminates against those who have no literacy skills. This claim was not refuted by the government. There were claims that it discriminates against many Australians, particularly students, who will be at different addresses. We heard evidence during the deliberations of the committee that up to two million Australians change address from one year to the next. So there will be a difficulty&mdash;and the Electoral Commission admits this&mdash;in catching up with those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be particularly disadvantageous for Aboriginal communities. Also&mdash;and I expressed this during the hearings&mdash;I have great concerns about the security that will surround the voting procedure for Aboriginal communities, particularly those in remote areas. It will discriminate against and disadvantage those Australians who will be travelling overseas. It will disadvantage non&hyphen;English speaking people, and millions of them have, as heads of their household, people who do not have a command of the English language as good as we would probably like them to have. Also, it would generally discriminate against those who are less powerful in our society. Maybe it is the wish of the government to do that. Maybe that is what they are about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned in passing my concerns about the security of the ballot in remote Aboriginal communities, but even greater concerns were expressed to the committee; concerns which we were not able to get adequate clarification on from the Electoral Commission officials or indeed from the  parliamentary secretary who also appeared before the committee. An immense scope for fraud exists through the use of the postal ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be some security provisions built into it, but those security provisions, including the bar coding, are themselves not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, as indeed we know. Our own very good system of voting which is in place now for elections is not 100 per cent perfect and errors, manipulation and electoral fraud have taken place in the past. But the scope for it to happen in this particular ballot is just immense. It is mind&hyphen;boggling
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4395"> that we in this chamber could be proceeding with this proposal here tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACTU had their concerns and they are experienced in the area of postal ballots. They drew the committee's attention to the more vulnerable sections of our community, the elderly who live in nursing homes. There are many good nursing homes, we know, but there are also some nursing homes which are not so good. It must be remembered that management in the not so good nursing homes, as well as management in the good ones, would have access to the birthday details of residents in the home. Another security provision that is supposed to protect the elector after casting their vote is for them, if they are able, to put their date of birth on the back of the envelope, which can be then checked by the Electoral Commission when they receive the envelope. There will be some people who are disadvantaged, who have sight problems, who will not be able to do that. There are also others in our community who, unlike me of Irish origin&mdash;I write my date of birth with the day, the month and then the year&mdash;write their birth date in reverse and there are others who do it in a different way again. That will cause a huge difficulty for those checking the security of the ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ballot for the supposed people's convention does not address those 76 individuals who will be appointed to it. Senator Margetts drew attention to the fact that there may have been adverts calling for nominations to be appointed to those positions but only 36 of those 76 are going to be nominated from the community. The other 40 are going to be politicians. In the break&hyphen;up of those 40, are there going to be equal numbers between the government and the opposition throughout Australia?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You will get your opportunity, Minister. You can make your contribution and I will come in and listen to it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS>  There are a couple of things that I want to conclude with. Attention was drawn by a number of people to what might be the ballot paper. The committee heard evidence that there could be up to 200 delegates from New South Wales. During the committee hearings, we directed questions to the Australian electoral office. We asked if they could help us in our deliberations in understanding the size of a ballot paper that would contain 200 names. We were provided with a draft ballot paper which, unfortunately for tonight's illustration, contains only 140 names. Were it to contain 200 names, obviously things would be more cramped. If things were more cramped, the names of the individual candidates would be less readable. For somebody like me, who needs glasses, it is going to be impossible for some members of the community even to read the names that are on here. That is what we are going to be faced with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To fit in with the financial situation, this ballot paper&mdash;it probably will be this size in New South Wales and possibly in Victoria or the other larger states where there will be a big number of candidates&mdash;will have to be folded three times to fit into an envelope. That envelope will have to be big enough to hold two other envelopes and instructions on how to vote and not exceed the weight and size limits imposed by Australia Post in order for the ballot paper to be posted for 35c or so per item, if it goes overland, and it quite likely will. It is quite likely that it could cost in the region of 70c per item. The government's argument about saving money by running a postal vote instead of a full presence vote that would occur in the course of a normal election is blown out of the water. It may very well be blown out of the water when the nominations for the convention, if the convention is ever held, come to the fore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final thing is that, even in the conservative south of my home state, my electorate of Western Australia, the people are not happy with this proposal. They have written to me,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4396"> certainly the Central South Regional Council of Western Australia have written to me, with great concerns that the proposal in the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill that the people of Australia will vote upon is not wide enough. Their concerns are manyfold. They name five things, but they go on and talk about another seven things. I did not give Mr Hassell, the secretary of the organisation, any hope that I would be able to change the bill before the Senate in order to accommodate his interest, but I did say that I would try to represent his interest in this place. I have shown a copy of this letter to the whip on the other side and I have asked permission for the letter to be incorporated into the speech that I am making this evening to the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and Senator McKiernan for your assistance in my being able to speak now. It is my turn for chair duty, and I appreciate the assistance of my colleagues. I am very pleased to speak in the debate on the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997. I think it could probably be better called the `breaking convention bill'. I also am pleased to speak in this debate as a South Australian senator, a representative from a state that, in 1894, was the first place to see women win the right to vote. Anybody who has had a passing interest in or knowledge of the campaign run to achieve that success in South Australia over 100 years ago will know how vitally important being able to participate in the parliament and the elections of the day was to women then and in large part is to women today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The women back then had such a long and tough campaign. Many times that proposed amendment was brought into the parliament and thousands of signatures were gathered by  industrious women working around the colony of South Australia. It was a matter of great rejoicing to read the descriptions from the women themselves of how they had to walk home from North Terrace to Prospect very late at night, but it did not matter because
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they walked with lighter feet because they had won that right to vote, to participate, to have their say. What women wanted was an opportunity to have a say. They had to win that right against very many people who argued, and indeed still argue, that women are not really fit for public office and are not really able to have a proper say or give proper consideration to or deliberate on issues, particularly the so-called larger issues of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In South Australia, women were very clear that they did want to have a say, and they have shown over the many years since that they are more than able to represent their views and the views of many constituents who often feel better represented by women because they themselves are women or that women have a different sympathy for the issues. Anyhow, if we are in a democracy and want broad representation, clearly we would want as wide a representation as we can. I am delighted that South Australia is the state that started the run for women to have an opportunity to vote in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will allow that interjection, Senator Vanstone, that I am not alone; because it will allow me to distinguish between you and your good colleague Senator Minchin&mdash;also from the same state. I will come back to that in a moment. It is interesting just in passing to note that Aboriginal women in South Australia also were able to vote after that ballot in 1894 when the legislation was passed into law in 1895. Aboriginal women did have the opportunity to vote and did exercise their vote. They subsequently lost that opportunity in the federal bill of 1902. The history on this matter is full of pertinence and nice ironies about the debate and the concerns confronting us tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not too long ago, in late May&mdash;a mere three weeks ago&mdash;I held a function in this place which I called `Women and the People's Convention'. I invited to speak at that convention Helen Irving, Deborah Cass, Hilary Charlesworth and Sue Dunlevy representing the media, for their important contribution to issues of public debate like this one. What we were campaigning for was 50 per

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that the paper today&mdash;and you often tell me never to believe what I read in the paper&mdash;says that Senator Minchin is minded to accept 50 per cent women to the convention. I am not clear whether Senator Minchin will actually accept 50 per cent of appointed and elected delegates. He has designed this legislation to designate a percentage representation of Aboriginal people and young people but, to this point, there is still no designated representation for women. `An appropriate percentage or representation' is what I believe the wording of that bill to say. I note that Senator Minchin&mdash;at least as reported in the paper which you, Senator Vanstone, tell me not to believe&mdash;now says that he is minded to accept 50 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted if we can get a 50 per cent representation of women. That is fair. For the record it should be noted that women are conceding a percentage or two of representation in this country, but we are not unreasonable. I am one who would argue that fair is fair: 50 per cent is a very good way to go in terms of representation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know what has changed Senator Minchin's mind. I mentioned him before because he also is from South Australia and until now&mdash;and even in large part in the design of this bill&mdash;I have had the view that Senator Minchin would have opposed the right for women to vote in 1894. He is very grudging about the benefits of moving towards a republic in this country. He is certainly not of the same South Australian ilk as his Liberal colleague Steele Hall, who went a long way towards electoral justice for the people in South Australia when he reformed the lower house vote and did away with  probably one of the better gerrymanders in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to note that when Don Dunstan was Premier he raised and won the issue for reform of the upper house in South
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia after fighting it through the South Australian parliament and in the community. I arrived in South Australia in 1969 and was shocked to discover that, if I did not own a property and I did not have a university degree, I was not entitled to vote in the upper house in South Australia. Fortune has favoured me and I was able to exercise my right to vote, but thousands of women were not.</PARA>

One of the things that is very interesting to learn is that people will often say, `This is not an issue that really bites to the heart of the community; they don't care,' but, yes, they do. Time and time again electoral reform has proven to be a very significant issue that enjoys and brings great support for the people proposing it. Certainly, Don Dunstan's name is associated with that electoral reform, and it is to his benefit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Vanstone, you should stop shouting at me. You should know already&mdash;and you do&mdash;that I am being very even&hyphen;handed here in reporting the truth of those reforms: Steele Hall was the Liberal Premier. He is a different sort of Liberal from a lot of others in this place. Since you have provoked me, Senator&mdash;not really, because I am not able to be provoked by you&mdash;let me say that I am sure that Senator Minchin is not of the same Liberal Party as Steele Hall. There is some grave doubt about where half the Liberals in South Australia reside. One could recall that at the moment the Liberal Party in South Australia is very publicly divided&mdash;something like 50 per cent&mdash;in its parliament, straight down the middle. It is line ball about who might be Premier next week&mdash;it depends on just who has the votes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You should be cautious with that interjection, Senator. I would have thought&mdash;and if it was not clear, I would like to make it
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4399"> clear&mdash;that when I was referring to Steele Hall I was quite clearly acknowledging a Liberal contribution. I do not believe I called Don Dunstan a Labor man but, since you are asking me to put a party ticket on Steele Hall, I will put a party ticket on Premier Don Dunstan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that electoral reform, which is often argued as not a matter of principal concern to the community, always turns out to be a matter that enjoys considerable community support and subsequent respect. When people argued, as Don Dunstan did, for one vote one value, we wanted some kind of fairness and equity for the people of South Australia in their representative vote for the upper house.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of an extensive preamble, that leads to a few other points that I want to make. As I said, I was very pleased to host a `Women and the People's Convention' because of my passionate commitment to building on the vote won for women in 1894 by the marvellous women and a number of significant men&mdash;after all, only men in parliament were able to vote for that change and their voting record should be noted. The women of South Australia have history and that campaign on their side and it is important that this convention build on that and that women in 1997 should be equally represented at the people's convention. It is long since past that there is any argument that says that women are not fit to hold public office or represent their views and the views of many people they know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have in this bill a proposal to move to non-compulsory voting. This is a very frightening change. I believe that it is a very significant change and a very frightening change because it is asking us to support in this place a significant change to what I think is one of the characteristics of this country. Compulsory voting is Australian. It is how we are. It actually enshrines in effect and in symbol the understanding that everybody is equal in Australia. There is no one vote more important than any other vote. We do not have a hierarchy of votes. We do not say that people who have university degrees have a better vote than people who work on assembly lines or push cars through Mitsubishi,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Ford or Holden. We say that everybody in Australia has a vote and every vote is equal to every other vote. That is Australian.</PARA>

You will not get child-care assistance unless your child has been immunised. It is not a case of saying, `It's a good thing; let's educate people to immunise'; you must. In particular, I find that curious since that same coalition when in opposition fought me all the way on proposals to make sure that there was quality care provided in child-care centres. The coalition is very slippery in the way it argues about this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point has been very well made by my colleagues that this legislation does not take into account people who cannot read English, whether they are unsighted or short&hyphen;sighted or whether they are not familiar with the English language. I think that is a significant move away from the efforts put in place over the years, particularly by the previous Labor government, to ensure that people did have access to the necessary information so as to be able to exercise their vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today at lunchtime I went out to a rally of the Association of Non-English Speaking Background Women of Australia, ANESBWA. They were actually campaigning by way of protest at the cut of at least $40,000 of their moneys to continue that organisation to assist women of non-English speaking background in this country. There is a nice irony that they have lost their money recently in the budget, we have a rally at  lunchtime and I can come in here and say that we are also seeing, as part of a consistency, legislation that is also denying women and men from a non-English speaking background
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> access to easy information to enable them to exercise their vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few years ago I represented Australia at the Southern African Development Coordination Conference, SADCC, as it was known then, in Mozambique. It was very interesting to be in Mozambique at that time and to learn the interest and the enthusiasm with which Mozambique was about to welcome advice from Australia on how to conduct elections. In particular,  they were very enthusiastic about the electoral education scheme that Australia had developed&mdash;a mobile service in this country that was particularly focused on assisting Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mobile service would go to remote and rural communities and ensure, by way of education and time out to talk with people, that Aboriginal people understood their rights and were able to exercise their vote at elections and referenda in this country. It is interesting to note that in the budget before this the $19 million to maintain that service was also removed from the Australian electoral scene. It is interesting and very ironic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As other countries emerged to a democracy they used to look to Australia for the assistance and the advice that we could offer. We were very pleased to offer that advice, but I find it is terribly sad, and beyond that really, that such a commitment to electoral education is now no longer part of the Australian electoral scene. I welcome Senator Minchin. It is time you turned up to take this in person across the chamber instead of via the benefits of electronic media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think much more needs to be said about this. I have made the point that I think compulsory voting is very much part of the Australian character. It is Australian; it is part of our symbol. It is interesting to ask: what sort of country are we and what are our symbols and mechanisms? I was terribly interested to note that Senator McKiernan took some of my lines that I have written right here. We did not speak about this; it is just that great minds think alike. We have a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who has just gone to the United Kingdom. We have a Prime Minister whose interest in symbols is actually characterised by the opening of the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4401"> Lord's test, some strawberries and cream on the lawns of Wimbledon, popping in to see Baroness Thatcher, and then visiting the Queen of England. They are unashamedly the symbols of our Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is where Prime Minister Howard stands. It is way out of step with so many people in Australia. Well over 60 per cent of Australians have indicated that they clearly see that the time has come for this country to move to becoming a republic. They want to do that with some kind of generosity, not by this mean&hyphen;spirited, creeping and grudging approach to whether or not Australia will be a republic.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite who argue the importance of trade with our nearby nations should be sympathetic to the importance those countries place on the emerging pride this nation has in moving toward becoming a republic.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the way of electing to this constitutional convention people who truly represent Australians' views on the republican issue. It is a bill that will see a majority of delegates who agree with the Prime Minister's narrow agenda and anachronistic views elected and appointed to the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a pity that we have this bill before the Senate rather than a bill that would allow for a direct vote by the Australian people on the question of whether or not Australia should be a republic and hence have an Australian as head of state. But, most of all, it is an absolute disgrace that the transition of Australia to a republic has been robbed of the dignity it deserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would first like to focus on the matter of the electoral system that the Prime Minister is advocating in this proposed legislation and the flaws associated with it. I find it ironic that one of the main arguments used by monarchists for maintaining the constitutional monarchy is the old adage `if it ain't broke, don't fix it', yet we have a bill that is not advocating following our normal compulsory attendance voting system in electing delegates to the convention&mdash;an electoral system that is proven and has provided for fair and democratic elections in this country since 1924.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So do we have the Prime Minister and anti-republicans calling for use of this electoral system that most definitely ain't broke? No. Instead we have a non&hyphen;compulsory postal ballot system being proposed. This electoral system will see the greatest number of Australians disenfranchised from this Constitutional Convention election process. They are going to be cut out of this extremely important process&mdash;a process of historic proportions&mdash;because the system chosen by the Prime Minister to elect delegates to the convention is designed, quite specifically, to make it difficult for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are going to see a package, probably around the size of the Tax Pack, arrive in the mail&mdash;and the rest is up to us. Who are the people who are going to be disenfranchised most? It is going to be the elderly and the frail, the young, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people in remote areas, people for whom English is a second lan
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4402"> guage, people who have literacy problems and people with disabilities. In fact, this Liberal government is continuing in its normal vein because the people who are going to be disadvantaged and left behind in this process are the Australians who are continually being kicked by the coalition government with all their other policies and budget measures. At least we can say that this government is consistent: consistent at cutting Australians out&mdash;out of security, out of protection and out of participation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Electoral Commission has already stated that there could be up to two million people who do not even get a postal ballot, merely because they have moved recently and have not updated their address details. This government prove with this bill that they believe in active citizenship only when it is cost effective&mdash;at least, that appears to be the excuse they are using this time round.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the matter of cost, the Australian Electoral Commission is going to have to send these out: a ballot paper, although at this rate most Australians will be lucky if they even get one of those; an envelope to place the completed ballot paper in; an envelope to return to the Australian Electoral Commission; and an information booklet&mdash;one assumes and hopes that this will be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this, and what does the government base its costings on? Sending out one small, normal sized envelope. So much for credible financial estimates. The government claims that a compulsory attendance ballot for the Constitutional Convention is both cost prohibitive and unnecessary. This rings hollow. As Senator Faulkner outlined earlier, the Australian Labor Party has never believed that the cost of democracy is an issue, nor do we believe it should be one now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the chamber support the use of a compulsory attendance ballot because it is the system that ensures that all Australians get a say. It is a fundamental principle of the Australian electoral system which is now going to be cheapened by the Liberals, merely  because they do not have faith in their own convictions on this matter and they are not brave enough to go before the Australian
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people&mdash;before all Australians&mdash;and put their argument against the republic. Why is this the case? Because they know that Australians would overwhelmingly support a republican model.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is the Prime Minister doing everything he can to ensure that this Constitutional Convention electoral process is one of disempowerment for Australians; he is also ensuring that it is the pro&hyphen;constitutional monarchy voices that are heard above everyone else's. The Australian people will be more than aware of the confidence trick the Prime Minister is trying to play on them, and I am sure they will be unforgiving of him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister is effectively guaranteeing that the Constitutional Convention will not come up with resolutions supporting a republic, because he is stacking the appointed delegates in favour of the government at a ratio of two to one. Talk about a man who likes working with good odds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to mention the issue of gender equity with respect to the Constitutional Convention. This is an issue I have not heard any government members mention. If the Prime Minister is trying to recreate that historic event at the end of the last century where a group of men got together at the Constitutional Convention to decide whether Australia would become a federation or not, he is going about it the right way. There is no commitment by the coalition to ensure that women have proportional representation at this convention. Perhaps there is a point of consistency there as well, given the large number of policy and budget decisions that also have disenfranchised and disempowered women in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that the Prime Minister is yesterday's man. The real problem is that he is trying to make Australia a yesterday's nation. This bill is just another step backwards. Where is the dignity in our transition to a republic? Under this government, there is none, and this bill will go down in history as a slight, as a reflection on the poor quality of this country's Prime Minister and this country's federal Liberal government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make my position clear from the beginning. I want more than just a republic. I want Australia to be a just republic. What we have got from this government in this Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997 is a proposal for a constitutional convention which is fundamentally anti-democratic. As Senator McKiernan pointed out earlier this evening, it is clearly not about a people's convention. The bill we are debating tonight is fundamentally in breach of the pre-election commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to involve the Australian people fully in the debate about the Australian republic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall that the Prime Minister has in the past attacked the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, because it was said that he sought to impose his views on the Australian people about the need for an Australian republic. What we have here though is a Prime Minister who seeks to impose his views by stealth. How does he do it? In his usual weak and sneaky manner. This bill is primarily aimed at making it as difficult as possible for Australians to actually be involved in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister is quoted in today's press as saying that, as far as he was concerned, the republic issue had gone away. Quite clearly, he is wrong. That is just what he wishes to be the case. This bill quite clearly reflects his wishful thinking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the question of the appointments, what you see is that there is quite a blatant bias towards conservatives in this country. Rather than having equal numbers from the various forces represented in this country on such a fundamental issue as the future constitutional make-up of this country, you see a mechanism being put in place which will ensure the domination of this convention by conservative coalition delegates. In terms of the appointed persons, under this proposal you would see 25 coalition delegates, 13 Labor delegates and two delegates from the minor parties or the Independ ents&mdash;and one of those Independents would be drawn from a hat. What a joke.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appointment of the non-parliamentary delegates equally is a joke. No-one knows who has been asked to nominate. No-one knows what criteria are being used to allow the Prime Minister to make his judgment on who he regards as appropriate. People have been asked to decide tickets of candidates for the election not knowing who is actually going to be appointed. The Prime Minister is trying to keep groups such as the Australian republican movement in the dark for as long as possible. He is trying to make things as hard as possible, and of course what he is trying to do through this bill is to extenuate that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The election process contained in this bill is also a joke. A system has been designed that will clearly disenfranchise, in my view, quite possibly the majority of people. It is designed to be voluntary, which of course is completely at odds with the way we vote for everything else within the government system of this country. It sends an implicit message that the government does not regard this event as particularly important. It seeks to denigrate it. It seeks to delegitimise the whole process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By also seeking to establish postal voting, the system seeks to disadvantage the homeless. It seeks to disadvantage those who move regularly. It disadvantages renters. It disadvantages students. It especially disadvantages young people and it especially disadvantages a group in the community who are known to be supportive of the republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Various estimates by the Electoral Commission have demonstrated that over a million Australians move every year, and it is likely that up to a million people will not actually be on the rolls at their correct address. If we look at the situation in recent council elections in Victoria, we see quite clearly the likely consequences of such a proposition, because this is the model the undemocratic government in Victoria seeks to adopt for local government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the elections in Monash, based on the state electorate of Oakleigh and the suburbs of Oakleigh, 119,118 voters were enrolled for the Monash Council elections, of which 74 per cent actually voted; that is, 88,000 voters. In various wards the rate of return fluctuated
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4404"> between 67 and 77 per cent. Over 3,000 ballot papers were returned with the voting packs marked `return to sender' because of the inaccuracies in the voters roll. An unknown number of voters were admitted to the ballot after ballot papers were completed and declaration slips were signed by people other than the intended voters. Signatures on the declaration slips were only checked to the extent that the right name had been signed. Or, if ineligible, actual voter signatures were not checked at all. Of the unknown numbers of ineligible voters no longer residents or ratepayers in Monash, we cannot tell how many actually participated in the ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further 3,000 ballot papers were excluded from the count by the returning officer because of their late arrival or because of mistakes by voters in completing the bureaucratic procedures associated with the ballot. The largest incidence of voter exclusion was where a group of voters forgot to sign the declaration slip or removed it themselves or inserted it in the ballot paper envelope after sealing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was also a very high incidence of family members signing the wrong declarations; that is, husbands signing their wives' declarations and vice versa. Voters who had a signature incorporating a different surname from that appearing on the voters roll, such as those who were newly married or separated women, also had their votes excluded where that difference was detected. Where the signature was illegible, the voter was excluded from the count. It is quite clear, from the assessments of those who are reviewing this matter and the residents groups in Oakleigh, that the blind, disabled and elderly who had someone complete their declaration slips on their behalf had their votes excluded where the signatures did not seem to fit the voter's name.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a pattern emerging from the election, where there were confusion errors and where there were allegations of fraud in regard to the number of voters excluded from the election. It made the whole ballot within that electorate, according to the assessments  of community groups in the district, subject to challenge. It is quite clearly indicative of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> how unacceptable that model of voting is for government elections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nature of the particular balloting system that is being proposed and the particular ballot papers in question is quite confusing. One would have to ask whether or not it has been designed to produce exactly that result, because it is quite clear to me that, in any examination of these ballot papers, they would maximise informal votes. While it might look like a Senate ballot paper, it quite clearly is not. The rules are not the same as for a Senate ballot paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is quite clearly a question here about the capacity to rort this balloting system. A complex method of filling out and returning maximises the chances, in terms of the ballot, for an increase in the informal vote, even for those who are actually committed to voting in such an election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 2.5 million Australians, as I understand it, come from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds. It strikes me that those people for whom English is not their first language are quite clearly disadvantaged by this system of voting, particularly as there will be no translations of the material. It further disadvantages a significant group of people who are known to be strongly supportive of the need to have an Australian republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other argument that is put is the question of cost. As Senator Faulkner pointed out earlier this evening, the cost of democracy has never been an issue in this country before. So why is it now? Why is it now a question of the cost of democracy? As far as I am concerned this is yet another miserable and pathetic effort by the apologists for the royalist position in this country to actually try to subvert what is quite clearly the majority will of the Australian people on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People indicate that the government is clearly following a minority position on these questions. This is despite the fact that the government promised it would give the Australian people full involvement in the processes leading up to the formation of an Australian republic. The government has rejected the simple concept of a plebiscite on whether Australians want an Australian as their head of state. Yet that is the fairest way
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4405"> of directly involving the Australian people in such a basic proposition. I believe it is because the government of this country knows what the answer would be to such a simple proposition as that. People would overwhelmingly say `yes' to that question. It would not be possible, under those circumstances, for the government to rort the system in terms of the expression of the Australian people's will. This is the sort of question we should be discussing: what is the mechanism by which Australians can best express their will?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people deserve a lot better. This country deserves a lot better than it is getting from this particular bill. The Australian Labor Party's amendments to this bill are designed to improve people's capacity to actually participate&mdash;to give Australians a fair go in deciding such an important issue. We want everyone to have a say. We want to be able to give everyone a chance to think about the issues. We are encouraging people to actually participate in such a fundamental question as this. Instead of showing people leadership on such a basic question, what you see is this Prime Minister wimping it yet again, as he has done on Wik, on the stolen children, on jobs and on industry policy. He would like to bury the issue but we are not going to allow that to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that the Senate also makes sure that the Prime Minister does not get away with such a blatant attempt to bury such an important issue. He should be held accountable. He should be held to the promise that he made to the Australian people to involve all Australians in the process of this convention and to genuinely make it a people's convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That means that we should have a proper election for candidates. We should not allow the rorting of the system to go on in the way that it is proposed in this bill. We should be seeking to ensure that there is a genuine capacity for people to participate and have their say in the sort of country that they are to inherit. We all have a real interest in this proposition. As far as we are concerned, the proposed method to select candidates to the  Constitutional Convention should be condemned. This process is quite clearly aimed
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at undermining the credibility and the potential usefulness of the convention itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our particular concerns go to the issue of the method of selection of the parliamentary representatives which gives an unfair advantage to coalition parties. There is a lack of an open, transparent and representative process in the way in which other appointments will be made. The method of election of elected delegates should be fundamentally reviewed. A voluntary system involving direct elections should be proposed. Otherwise, the proposal by this government&mdash;what is essentially a voluntary and postal system&mdash;will effectively disenfranchise a large section of the population, particularly those who have moved in recent years. It will also ensure that persons from a non&hyphen;English speaking background, the poorest and the less literate sections of our community, will be disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal being voiced by this government is quite clearly a political experiment for the broader application to the Australian electoral system. It is a system that Senator Minchin has championed. Mr Georgiou in Victoria&mdash;from the same party&mdash;has indicated that it is a mistaken view adopted by Senator Minchin. It is rare that I agree with Mr Georgiou, but on this occasion I do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin, your proposals and those of your Prime Minister, are fundamentally elitist and undemocratic, and it is disingenuous and discriminatory for you to suggest that other actions should be taken. Your proposal is designed to minimise the level of political participation in this country&mdash;not to maximise it. It is designed fundamentally for you to gain narrow political advantage as you perceive it in the short term and to disadvantage the rest of this country. What is being proposed is a form of ballot paper which, as far as I am concerned, is unnecessarily complex and constitutes a major disincentive to voting. It is aimed to further disadvantage people who have difficulties with both language and literacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are suggesting that the government ought to adopt a genuine Senate style of voting. We are the first to admit that the Senate has its limitations. But it is a far better system of voting.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Let us turn to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, of which, I have to say, I am somewhat critical, but which the Left wing upholds in this country as though it is some great document. What does this document tell us about family life? It is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Convinced</EMPHASIS>  that the family, as the fundamental group of society and the natural environment for the growth and well&hyphen;being of all its members and particularly children, should be afforded the  necessary protection and assistance

<PARA STYLE="Para">So that is the first point of the Lyons Forum's beliefs. The second one is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe marriage is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life . . .</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very interesting to comment on Senator Neal's interjection. Do you know where that wording is from? It is directly out of the Family Law Act, introduced into this place by your hero Senator Lionel Murphy. Section 43(a) of the Family Law Act says, there is:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA STYLE="Para">So it is hardly something that the Lyons Forum thought up overnight. It is in the Family Law Act of this country. The beliefs of the forum go on to say that we believe the family unit:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The Convention on the Rights of the Child clearly acknowledges that. The third belief is:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">If the first two points are accepted, as they are by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, by the Convention on the Rights of the Child and by sections in the Family Law Act, I think the third point that the Lyons Forum believes in stands on its own.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw that, Madam President. The Lyons Forum is the organisation that has been labelled somehow as sinister, secretive and extreme. It has been labelled as sinister and secretive because it does not disclose its membership publicly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a member of Rotary International. I am a member of the Liberal Party. I am a member of the RSPCA. None of those organisations disclose their membership publicly and, might I add, nor does the trade union movement in this country, nor does the Australian Labor Party, nor do the Australian Democrats. By the same analysis, they are somehow sinister, somehow secretive. But, of course, the most galling thing of all is that all these journalists who write these things and promote these things on the airwaves, I am sure, are members of the Australian Journalists Association, which similarly does not publicly disclose which of its number are actually members of that association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that anybody concerned about today's society, if we have a look at the statistics on drugs, if we have a look at the statistics on suicide, if we have a look at the statistics on antisocial behaviour amongst the youth of this nation, would know that there is, very unfortunately, a common thread that is often found&mdash;that is, a dysfunctional family background. That is very, very sad. Therefore, we in the Lyons Forum say that if we can somehow arrange or assist families not to become dysfunctional, the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> youth of this country would be so much better off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been some astounding assertions made, for instance, that the organisation is patriarchal. There is a female member on the executive, a superb female member, the honourable member for Lilley, Elizabeth Grace. She is a fantastic member who, I am sure, will continue to serve the people of Lilley very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then they tell us that none of the members of the forum are divorced. That is also wrong. I happen to know of a member in the forum who is divorced and has remarried a woman who was divorced and had a child from the previous marriage. That assertion is completely untrue. When those sorts of facts are pointed out to the journalist concerned, do we get an apology? None whatsoever. So, once again, we have this misinformation. Within the Lyons Forum, we have married people, divorced people and remarried people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some in our community who are superstitious about the 13th of the month falling on a Friday. That was the case last Friday. There were some people who were particularly unlucky on that day. But I would suggest that the majority of Australians were very lucky. I want to elaborate on that point and draw attention to reports in Saturday's newspapers and exemplify the point of those who were unlucky. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>  had a headline on page 11 which read `Rapist must go: Ruddock' and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>  had this headline on page 3 `Ruddock to deport rapist, swindler'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anybody who cares about a free, open and fair immigration system for this country and those who are concerned about our refugee and humanitarian programs would be aware of the very good decision of the High Court of Australia in the matter of Mr Guo Wei Rong and Mrs Pan Run Juan. It is the latter on which I want to concentrate, but I am particularly pleased to record Minister Ruddock's decision with regard to the rapist in Perth. That was causing a great deal of consternation amongst constituents of mine in Western Australia who made contact with my office. I recognise that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the decision I particularly want to recognise is that of the High Court of Australia in the matter of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) against Mr Guo Wei Rong and Mrs Pan Run Juan. I want to concentrate my effort here tonight on Mr Guo. He has led a very chequered career which brought him to the attention of the authorities way back in 1985 when he was apprehended in Hong Kong and fined for smuggling a boatload of people, human beings, into Hong Kong. We do not know how many trips he had made smuggling these people in before he was apprehended, but the apprehension and the fine did not deter him because the very next year he was at it again. He was apprehended again and sent back to China where he was sentenced to two years in a labour camp in China for his illegal activities. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to digress for a moment to note that today we see in our newspapers photographs of the gates of the Whitehead detention centre in Hong Kong closing. I went to that place some years ago as part of my parliamentary studies and witnessed some 6,000 people being detained there in conditions that were not very pleasant for the individuals and that were certainly not very pleasant for somebody to look upon how human beings were living there. I am very pleased that the Whitehead camp in Hong Kong has closed. That blight of boat people in detention on our society has very nearly been brought to an end in that part of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us get back to Mr Guo. He served his apprenticeship in shipping people illegally into Hong Kong&mdash;to whatever fate is something others have to address. But Australia was to get a taste of him. In April 1992, he, his wife and one of his two children&mdash;and that is important to remember&mdash;arrived illegally in Darwin on a boat named the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jeremiah</EMPHASIS>. There were 10 other people on that boat. He and the rest of the people on the boat applied for refugee status in Australia, but he was rejected after a departmental review of his application. He did not accept this decision willingly and participated very publicly in a demonstration with others on the roof of the buildings of the Port Hedland detention centre. They received quite an enormous amount of publicity for that protest and some of the people actually hurt themselves pretty badly when they jumped off, but not Mr Guo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He appealed the earlier rejected decision to the Refugee Review Tribunal, but in September 1992 that was rejected as well. In October 1992, he was forced by the minister of the day to leave Australia. In October 1993, a year after he left Australia, the couple's third child was born. I said earlier that it was important to recognise the number of children because we do hear quite a deal of claims made by people about China's one child policy. Here was a person who fled China after having two children&mdash;he left one behind&mdash;who was returned to China, had a third child and then fled again.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4410">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They came to Australia on this occasion on a boat named the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quokka</EMPHASIS>, which was carrying 24 people. It landed in Broome in Western Australia in December 1993, where they again applied for refugee status in this country. That application was rejected but, in accordance with Australia's laws, they appealed against that decision to the independent review body. In May 1994, their appeal was rejected. That was the fourth occasion that their claims for refugee status and their applications for protection visas in Australia were assessed and rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Mr Guo was a determined man, and he had quite a deal of support in his applications. He and his lawyers trotted off to the Federal Court of Australia. They made an application to try to overturn the review decision. The application was duly heard, again in accordance with Australia's laws. Mr Justice Sackville dismissed the application in May 1995. Five: nil. The application was rejected on five separate occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, Mr Guo was determined. He&mdash;and the lawyers who were providing benevolent service to him free of charge&mdash;then took the case to the full court of the Federal Court of Australia. On 26 February 1996, in a landmark decision, Justices Beaumont, Einfeld and Foster handed down&mdash;in their wisdom&mdash;a decision which overturned all the laws that this parliament was making and had made in regard to the determination of refugee decisions in Australia. In short&mdash;it was quite a lengthy decision by their honours&mdash;they determined that they had the right to determine who was a refugee and who was not, despite what this parliament had said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Timing was important in this. Although it was during the hiatus period of an election, the minister of the day decided to appeal against the decision to the highest court in the land: the High Court of Australia. Last Friday, the High Court, with their honours Chief Justice Brennan and Justices Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby, handed down a unanimous decision overturning the decision of the full court of the Federal Court of Australia. I certainly welcomed that decision&mdash;so much so that yester
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> day I gave notice of a motion I wanted to move in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I asked for formality for that motion, which I thought was a relatively simple motion. It was in four parts. The first part noted the High Court decision, the second part called on Mr Guo and Mrs Pan to accept the decision. The third part suggested that they make their own plans to immediately leave Australia. The fourth part called on the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) to set in motion whatever lawful procedures were available to him to effect their removal if the individuals did not do that themselves. The matter was not declared formal, and hence tonight I am putting my reasons for putting the notice of motion.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4410"><TITLE>Newcastle Youth Forum

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to talk about a recent trip I made to Newcastle and some of the discussions I had with young people in Newcastle&mdash;in particular, with students who were feeling the effects of budget cuts to the University of Newcastle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I arrived in Newcastle the weekend before last, at a time when there was quite a degree of upheaval. The papers had been dominated by issues such as the BHP pull out&mdash;the closure of the steelworks in that region and the consequent job losses over the next two years. On a happier note, I was there at a time when two conferences geared towards issues of environmentalism and sustainability were taking place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was proud to take part in a youth forum organised by youth workers, social workers and charity workers in the region. It was at a place called the Ark, which happens to be the new headquarters of the Salvation Army in that region. I also attended a place called the Pod, which is a public place funded by youth&mdash;with no government assistance, I might add. It is full of computers, and facilities for young people to take refuge, talk or have a place of their own.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4411">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that the level of youth unemployment in Newcastle is higher than the national average. The rate of youth suicide, specifically for younger males in the central coast region, is amongst the highest in the industrialised world. I certainly got the impression from many young people in the area that they felt they faced quite an uncertain future as a result of the BHP closure. Many of them were worried about job opportunities for themselves and their families and were equally concerned about access to education and training facilities and the opportunities for them and their families to be involved in reskilling and skill development in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of these young people made clear to me that they felt that their city could make the transition from being a steel city to being a smart city, but they acknowledged that it requires a gutsy government that is prepared to invest in long&hyphen;term future sustainable industries. That means putting money into areas like education, research and environmentally sustainable fields. In fact, I think these days more people are employed in the education sector in that city than in the BHP steelworks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned that while I was in town the Pathways to Sustainability Conference was happening. The Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) was a guest at that conference. He had to face many protesters who were, understandably, lamenting this government's record on issues such as greenhouse gases and other environmental issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conference tied into young people's view of a green, high&hyphen;tech future for the city of Newcastle. They feel that the future of Newcastle entails more than simply mines and vines; it entails high&hyphen;tech, sustainable and information based industries of the future. I was also impressed by plans for an&mdash;at this stage&mdash;environmentally friendly waterfront development. As I understand it, it is funded primarily from better cities funding. Understandably, the people of that region are very concerned as to whether or not that development&mdash;and the consequent employment opportunities&mdash;will go ahead, given the changes to funding arrangements involving better cities projects.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I return to education, because this seemed to be an issue that recurred in my discussions. Contrary to suggestions made by the minister today that institutions, higher education institutions in particular, in remote or regional areas&mdash;I might add that the University of Newcastle is quite a large institution&mdash;are being well looked after and strengthened, I would like to point out some of the changes that have taken place at the University of Newcastle as a consequence of budget measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have lost 40 general staff from the Finance and Property Division; 40 general staff have been shed from the University Secretary and Registrar; in the Faculty of Architecture, the budget has been slashed by $250,000, two academic staff have gone, there are no funds to repair equipment that is badly in need of repair; in the Faculty of Art and Design, the budget cuts have taken away $720,000 and nine academic staff, contact hours have been reduced and many of the consumables and supplies are now available on a user pays basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences have lost over $1 million, six academic staff, eight general staff, and they have had a reduction in support staff as well; the Faculty of Economics and Commerce have lost $666,000 and 15 academic staff, three general staff members will also be lost; the Faculty of Engineering have targeted savings of over $1 million with 11 academic staff and 20 general staff due to lose their jobs; the Faculty of Law is due to lose around $200,000 as well as four academic staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences will lose over $2 million and 14 academic staff and 30 general staff are due to go; the Faculty of Music will lose over $200,000, two academic staff and four general staff; the Faculty of Nursing, $340,000 will go, six academic staff and three general staff; the Faculty of Professional Education has a targeted savings of around $150,000, one academic staff member and one general staff member, the research is $20,000 down; and the Faculty of Science and Mathematics have targeted savings of, I believe, around $1 million with 18 academic staff and 13 general
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4412"> staff to go. The total number of academic staff made redundant is around 95. The total number of general staff made redundant is around 198 at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The university may have less staff but, of course, as the minister insists, enrolments have been maintained. Accordingly, class sizes have jumped, student contact hours have been reduced, tutorial times of course have been reduced as well. The library has cut its budget by around $900,000 and it is proposed that something like 21 library staff will also be shed. I think they are quite startling figures. They certainly give a local and very specific perspective of the kinds of job losses and the impact on quality as a result of budget changes over the life of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note the government's claims that it has enhanced opportunities for young Australians in regions such as Newcastle, and across the board. I cannot help but mention the proposed common youth allowance&mdash;the announcement made by Senator Newman, the Minister for Social Security, earlier today. We will see people who are not employed, people who are not engaged in education or training, those who are not studying, under the age of 18, lose their benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier tonight, Senator Abetz got up to talk about families and how they must be adequately looked after and resourced. What this government has just done to Australian families with the CYA&mdash;the common youth allowance&mdash;is absolutely shameful. It is all very well to tout families as being places of safety and security, but how can you really misread the economic reality? Consider the economic situation of families today, struggling in many cases with one or even two parents out of work, and now they have this further burden to endure of young people who are under 18, who are not employed, who are not in educational training, being deprived of any kind of benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I listened to Senator Abetz's speech regarding the Lyons forum, I have to say that, while I acknowledge families can be heaven on earth at times, they can also be places of absolute terror and destitution for some people. If we talk about protecting young
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people in Newcastle or anywhere else in this nation, we have to ensure that families and family environments are safe, that they are adequately resourced, that they have money, that they have access to employment, and that they have ways and means to get out of poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The young people that I met at the Ark and at the Pod in Newcastle shared these concerns. They talked about issues of sexual abuse and drug abuse at home and homelessness. They talked about those young people who could not access benefits, such as homeless benefits, because they did not know what rights they had or what benefits they could access. In fact, sometimes they were victims of their own resourcefulness, because they found ways of finding a day here or a night there where they could stay with friends or families or kind strangers and charity workers who would take them in. But those hidden homeless statistics are rarely taken into account by governments and by welfare systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that poverty is intimately linked with unemployment. I think the youth unemployment figures released this month are a sad reminder of the fact that youth unemployment is at crisis point around this nation and, particularly, in Newcastle. Finally, I would like to thank those people of Newcastle for their hospitality and I look forward to returning to update those young people on what has been happening in these decision making bodies and others around the country.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4412"><TITLE>Bowen: Unemployment</TITLE>

It is interesting that I am following Senator Stott Despoja, because I will be referring to the comparability between the situation in Newcastle and the situation in Bowen. But before speaking, I would like to thank my colleague Senator Ian Macdonald, who deferred his place on the speakers' list so that I do not have to speak at 100 miles an hour. Thank you, Senator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is appropriate that I should be speaking in these circumstances, because it
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4413"> gives me the opportunity to say that I do believe there is, in regard to the crisis in Bowen, a cross&hyphen;party approach. I would like to just recognise the work that the local member, De-Anne Kelly, has already done in lobbying ministers of the government to recognise the extent of the crisis. I refer to a press release in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bowen Independent</EMPHASIS> on 28 May, `Kelly lobbies ministers on Bowen's future.' The local member has already indicated her concern and approached ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, the Labor state opposition has been to Bowen and has made strenuous representations to state government ministers about the need for a rescue package. They have also had discussions with the council and clearly they are equally as concerned as the local member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many senators would not know very much about Bowen. It is a small seaside community. It has traditionally had an employment base largely connected with the meatworks at Merinda, some primary industry and some tourism. The plight of meatworkers from the Thomas Borthwick and Sons Merinda works has been highlighted in recent months. The meatworkers were four months into a 12 months agreement&mdash;registered with the Industrial Relations Commission last September&mdash;when the management called the agreement off, just like that, and put forward another one, a non&hyphen;negotiable agreement in which the workers would have to work longer than 40 hours per week for less than the award wage. For some this pay cut equalled up to $150 per week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Naturally the meatworkers refused to agree to this and Thomas Borthwick and Sons, owned by Nippon Meat Packers of Tokyo, have said that the Merinda works will not be reopened. Moreover, they have gone on to say that the buildings will be demolished, which seems to be an extraordinary waste of a very appropriate facility. I know that a number of people in the community would like to see a feasibility study of whether or not a community cooperative with an interest&hyphen;free loan from state and federal government could reopen the meatworks. There has also been talk of the building being listed as part of the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> national heritage, that it would be absolutely criminal to bring the building down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While Bowen is a small community and does not have the big numbers of Newcastle, the extent of job loss is indicated in these figures which I would like to table. These figures highlight the problem in Bowen because there has been an increase in the registered unemployment benefit recipients of some 286 between November last year and May this year and some figures that I obtained while I was in Bowen last week indicate that the figures now could have increased to 1,275. Whether we look at those figures&mdash;the official figures&mdash;or whether we rely on the word of mouth figures, which I am sure have considerable reliability, we are looking at between a 44 per cent and a 50 per cent increase. That is way ahead of even the highest in Queensland which is Rockhampton and Ingham at around 35 to 36 per cent in the six months. So clearly Bowen does have an enormous problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When BHP announced the 2,000 job losses in Newcastle within the next two years, an instant response from federal and state governments and a $20 million rescue package was announced within a matter of a few weeks. I commend the federal government on its prompt response to that situation, although I note that that will be a crisis in two years time. I do not begrudge Newcastle having that assistance. It is very much needed. But the crisis in Bowen is now. The jobs have gone, 1,275 are on the DSS unemployment lists and we have still to hear from federal government. I know people in state parliament were hoping that there would be something in the Queensland budget and unfortunately there was not. Clearly, there has to be some immediate, urgent action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have joined De&hyphen;Anne Kelly in writing to a number of ministers&mdash;Minister Vanstone, Minister Moore, Minister Anderson and indeed the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)&mdash;putting these four points that were highlighted to me last week. One related to the meatworks. I have already talked about how many members of the community were interested in establishing a community cooperative, if that is a viable option. Obviously some form of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4414"> feasibility study would have to be done and that would have to be done speedily, because we need urgent responses. There are primary industry and tourism opportunities in the region thatcould be enhanced if relevant federal and state departments offered professional advice and some strategic financial incentives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, Bowen should be in receipt of an immediate grant of assistance under the assistance for depressed regions program. I note from the budget papers that there is something like $20 million in that program. I am sure that, under any criteria, Bowen would have to qualify. Finally, the council and the community are not just sitting back waiting for government to respond. They are taking their own action. There is talk of establishing a Bowen's future think&hyphen;tank, which would meet in the next month and work with federal and state governments and the community to start to develop a practical course of action to plan options for job regeneration both immediately and in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing more depressing than talking with people who feel that the world has gone by without giving them due care and consideration. Certainly there are many people in Bowen who just wonder whether federal and state governments realise where Bowen is on the map. I am sure that, with the efforts of cross&hyphen;party support, we will get some urgent action on a scale comparable to that in Newcastle. It is equal to the crisis that faces Newcastle, with BHP withdrawing so many jobs. The difference is that the crisis in Bowen is now. Therefore, it is absolutely essential that the relevant ministers respond immediately and send their representatives to Bowen to sit down with the council and start to talk of both short&hyphen;term and long&hyphen;term packages to assist this small town.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="11.07 p.m." PAGE="4414"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 11.07 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)&hyphen;(2) All Members and Senators are required to register their private interests and to regularly update their declarations. These registers are available for public inspection. In addition, Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries are required to provide and regularly update a declaration of their private interests and also to declare any interest which might be affected by their decision in relation to particular issues. As Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I have no knowledge of declarations by other Ministers and by Parliamentary Secretaries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The cooperative environmental assessment process currently underway between the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments will ensure that any impacts on coastal wetland habitats are minimised.
