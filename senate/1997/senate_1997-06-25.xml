<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a general trend with this government with regard to public policy. It is a trend that has seen the government blame those people who are worst hit by this government's policies for their predicament. Rather than government policy that encourages participation, assists in economic growth and provides a safety net for those worst hit by dramatic changes, we have a government that seeks to make budgetary cuts which at best may be characterised as inappropriate. We have witnessed this trend in many areas over the past 12 months. These are reflections of a government that appears to have no strategic plan to resolve the issues confronting Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Health care for the aged in Australia is one of the most compelling issues facing governments in this country. The Australian population is increasingly moving towards an age of dependence. This requires a policy that seeks to adequately provide top quality health care and support services for the aged population. The policy needs to take a strategic view of the necessity to combine the need for improved service delivery and maintenance
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> standards with the reality that government outlays will inevitably be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, more efficient and effective ways of spending money must be found, but at what cost to our elderly? As I said, this needs to be a strategic policy. It requires a proposal to mix the reduction in funds with better service delivery. The acceptance of fewer funds should not be used as justification in itself for financial cuts. Improved service provision is an integral part of the framework in which aged care must be designed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In understanding the proposals of this government in regard to aged care, some historical knowledge of the portfolio is required. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a dramatic increase in the number of homes opening up to care for the aged. This growth, however, was unchecked and concerns arose regarding poor standards of accommodation and care. It additionally appears that there was an overemphasis on institutionalisation. Access to care was not universal around Australia and differed significantly in each of the states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result of those concerns was the introduction of the aged care strategy in 1985 by the Hawke government which at that time received bipartisan support. The strategy established a system of care that was based upon standards of dependency and care required. For example, the distinction between nursing home and hostel was established. Additionally, entry to a nursing home was by way of assessment by the aged care assessment teams.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1990, there was a review of the strategy, and modifications were introduced. The emphasis placed on providing care for the aged was not viewed as a burden by the government. Rather, it was accepted as an important function of government. In 1985, the government spent $1.2 billion on aged care, and this was increased to $2.6 billion by 1993&hyphen;94. This money was not seen as a burden by the government. Rather, it was money designed to ensure that an ageing population had appropriate care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, the dollar value was not the only focus of the government's strategy. The Labor
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5066"> government had a strategic view of aged care and ensured that it was funded adequately and targeted appropriately. Labor's view was, and  is, that nursing home care should be available to all Australians equally on the basis of clinical need. The quality of this care is paramount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nursing home care is exactly that: a care issue. It is not, as the government views it, an accommodation issue. This has not been the approach of the current government. The Howard government's Aged Care Bill is not about upgrading and improving health care services to this nation's elderly. It is not designed in a framework that seeks to address the issues of health care for the aged. It provides no proposals to improve and enhance service delivery. It is a bill that stems from last year's federal budget, which was about cutting federal expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aged Care Bill was designed by the minister to ensure that her department played their part in the cuts on government spending. This is the undeniable truth. The bill is a cost cutting exercise, not an improved health care bill. The issues addressed should be more about effective service delivery, better targeting of problems and groups affected. The issue addressed should not be cost cutting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has introduced this cost cutting exercise in relation to aged care in two main ways. Firstly, there has been an up&hyphen;front entry fee of the so&hyphen;called up&hyphen;front accommodation bond. The Labor Party believes that this will result in a two&hyphen;tier aged care system: one tier for those fortunate enough to be able to pay the uncapped up&hyphen;front fee and those who do not have the financial means available for top quality care. The wealthy and the better off will get top quality health care, and the poor and those less fortunate will receive a substandard service. An assets test will determine ability to pay the fee and, importantly, the family home will be classed as an assessable asset. Only those with a spouse or a relative who is a carer on a government benefit and has been resident in the family home for five years will not have to sell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no upper limit to the size of the entry fee. The only requirement is that the person must be left with $22,500 in assets.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The nursing home is able to hold the money in trust, keep the interest earned and draw down $2,600 per annum for five years. For those government senators who argue that Labor claims regarding up&hyphen;front entry fees are a scare campaign, I would point out the fact that the current average entry fee for hostels is $40,000 per person. The sums mentioned are already real.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is easy to see that people who are wealthy will be able to afford health care, while those who are less fortunate will be left with less than satisfactory health care. The government attempts to argue away this problem by pointing to the service provided by not for profit aged care providers. This, though, is a weak argument. Clearly the trend is a shift towards user-pays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As government funding for aged care is further reduced and dries up under the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, not for profit homes will have little to no capital to adequately provide their service. The result will be either a complete reduction in building facilities and service provision, with not for profit homes closing eventually, or the need for them to commence charging up-front fees in order to raise the capital required to continue, thus destroying the purpose for their existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that senators also understand the legal requirements that for profit nursing homes have upon them that force them to leave the disadvantaged people behind. This issue has been discussed in some detail in the House of Representatives, but I believe that it requires discussion here also. Senators need to understand that under corporations law the managing directors of the nursing home, particularly if it is listed on the stock exchange, are obliged to do everything in their power to maximise returns to shareholders. That is their obligation under the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, if there is one bed available, and one person has a $200,000 home to sell for the entry fee, another person only has half that amount to sell and another person has no money at all but clinically needs the care, the nursing home is obliged under corporations law to give the care to the person who can pay the maximum amount. A failure to do so
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5067"> would be a breach of fiduciary duty to their shareholders. Even if the directors wanted to  assist the disadvantaged person, they could not. That is the effect of this law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the impacts do not stop here. The fee will also result in most people having to sell their homes. While the legislation makes some allowance for relatives and carers who have been in the house for five years, there is no support or protection for single persons. Statistics show that around 90 per cent of those entering nursing homes have been living alone. Therefore, for 90 per cent of entrants, selling their house will be a requirement. The government has attempted to cover this up by providing a subsidy for concessional residents. The subsidy is $5 per day, subject to later amendments that were agreed to yesterday, as I understand it, between the Democrats and the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure creates an obvious problem. If nursing homes have to choose between those who receive the agreed amount and those who have a home to sell in order to pay the fee immediately, the nursing home will accept the person with the home. The person selling the home can provide the nursing home with a larger income than the person receiving the government subsidy. Thus, we create a two-tiered health care system for the aged. Equally, if the fee is uncapped, what will stop the nursing home allowing entry to those with $200,000 homes, who can therefore afford a higher fee, against those with $80,000 homes, who can afford only a lesser fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister in the House of Representatives argued that there was no need for pensioners to sell their homes. The minister argued that pensioners could move into a nursing home and rent out their house, using the rent to make periodic payments to the nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us consider a fairly typical problem, and here I rely upon a document provided by the Department of the Parliamentary Library Information and Research Services headed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Accommodation bonds for residential aged care: will we need to sell our homes?</EMPHASIS> I refer to page 7 of that draft document, where there is a discussion of options available to persons
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in this category. There they give a fairly typical example of a widow, Mrs Smith, who lives alone in an inner Brisbane suburb. The market value of her home is around $250,000. The market rent is about $250 per week net. Her personal effects and furniture are minor, and she has no other assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the example, Mrs Smith needs nursing home care. She is hopeful of returning to her own home when her illness is over, but she needs to rent the family home to meet the periodic payments of the nursing home. As I said, her rent is $250 a week and her pension is reduced to $76.10 per week, giving her a total income of $326.10. She pays tax of $33.19 and resident fees of $197.95, determined according to the formula in the act. Her net income before the periodic payment is $94.96, and the periodic payment for the accommodation bond is $99.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Mrs Smith, at the outset, is $4 per week short of the periodic payment option. Even if the rental on her home were $350 per week, she would still only have an additional $8.75 per week. The position would be worse if higher bond figures were used. So the draft of this report concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The combined effect of the reduction in the pension, increased resident fees and taxation along with the high interest component of the period payment is to eliminate this option as an alternative to selling the home for someone in Mrs Smith's circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has commented several times that no-one will be forced to sell their home to pay an accommodation bond. It is difficult to see that Mrs Smith has any option but to sell her home to raise the amount necessary to pay a bond. However, she may be able to avoid this if she is willing to move to an area where there may be excess capacity in nursing homes and where bonds are not charged or where they are very low. So the option put by the minister&mdash;and constantly referred to her in debate and in discussions&mdash;is, in fact, no option at all for persons in the situation of Mrs Smith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister attempts to argue that this measure is designed to arrest the decrease in funds available to health care by injecting
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5068"> private sector funds into the aged care system and to make accessible to nursing homes the  funds required to immediately, and into the future, upgrade their facilities. There is, however, a flaw in this argument, and it highlights the devil in the detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aged Care Bill only allows certified nursing homes to charge an entry fee. However, the nursing home will have to meet certain standards before it can get certification. The nursing homes will be in a position where they will not be able to charge the fees required to upgrade their services because they are not certified, and they have no way of improving the condition of their buildings and services without capital injection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a flaw the government is yet to explain. Even if this flaw were rectified, the government faces one further problem with the capital injection rationale. There is no requirement in the legislation for the nursing home to spend the entry fee on upgrades and improved service provision. They may, if they so please, take the fee as profit. The only requirement for the nursing home is that the draw&hyphen;down money of $2,600 per year be used for maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second method in which the bill cost cuts rather than improves health care is through the increased charging of daily fees. As the situation stands at the moment, all residents pay 87&half; per cent of the pension. By way of this bill, there will now be an extra daily fee of 25c in the dollar above the pension free area of up to $60 per day. If a pensioner earns $1 more than $50 per week then the government will impose an additional tax. This will be a tax on people earning just $51 per week while Mr Howard gives $450 in a savings rebate to those who choose to go down that path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A 25c in the dollar tax for anything over $50 per week is a blatant attack on the elderly in this country. When this is calculated in addition to the Medicare levy, the income tax on extra earnings, the withdrawal of the pensioner rebate and a social security pension reduction, Australian pensioners stand to pay an effective marginal tax rate of 75c to 91c in the dollar.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn my attention to the quality of care that will be provided under these new changes. Firstly, there is no auditing process in place to monitor the quality of care and to ensure the service provision is adequate. We are already aware that the self&hyphen;funded homes are pushing for self-auditing. This would be a situation where a nursing home could charge any entry fee it likes, take that money and place little emphasis on health care once agreements have been signed and the money has been handed over, and then audit its own procedures. Additionally, there is no guarantee or proposed measure to ensure that moneys received by the nursing homes from the Commonwealth are spent in specified areas. There is no suggestion that the Labor requirements for usage of Commonwealth money for nursing homes, requiring expenditure or a refund to the Commonwealth if not spent, not profit delivery, will be retained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quality of care is an issue that received significant attention from the Senate committee inquiry into the funding of aged care institutions. The committee had various concerns in this regard. Firstly, the committee was concerned that the quality of health care would be significantly reduced. The committee was particularly concerned that highest quality nursing care would be available to residents and that this would be provided by qualified and trained staff. Another concern of the committee was the auditing process through which the quality of care provided could be assessed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To this effect the committee has proposed the establishment of the new Aged Care Standards Agency. The intent would be for the agency to have sufficient power to investigate the quality of care and rights of nursing home residents and to ensure they meet predetermined standards. Additionally, the agency should have enforcement mechanisms and would require funding accordingly. The committee also expressed concerns regarding the loss of acquittal through the care aggregated funding formula. In this regard, the committee recommends that nursing homes continue to be required to acquit that proportion of their funding expended on nursing and personal care.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5069">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be much debate over the recommendations of the committee and the response from the government in due course will be interesting. Regardless of the final position of all senators and their parties, the committee report has highlighted the large degree of concern generated in the community in relation to nursing homes and aged care. This high level of concern, which is a result of self&hyphen;interest and concern for family members who do or will require support, must be understood and acted on. A resolution must be sought in regard to funding issues rather than simply deciding to cut funds and leave the end result to market forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">User rights is a further issue that requires a more detailed explanation before it is considered satisfactory by the opposition. The issue of user rights is at the core of the debate regarding the appropriateness or otherwise of marketplace practice being applied to health care for the aged. It should be remembered by the government that in excess of 60 per cent of people entering nursing homes do so after an acute illness. This may be a heart attack or severe stroke. This means that patients are literally forced by their illness to immediately enter a nursing home. There are currently no proposals to ensure that where the nursing home becomes essential, there is adequate counselling, advice and protection for those signing nursing home agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I make the point that the issue of health care is one that does not face Australia alone. It is a problem being confronted by many other governments world wide. In this regard, it is not a crisis. It is an issue for government planning and action. I am always sceptical of governments that push the crisis button. It is done by governments to create an atmosphere and environment that will encourage, allow and justify draconian actions like wide, sweeping budget cuts. The Aged Care Bill is an important one for Australians to confront.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our senior citizens do not deserve to be told that they should sell their homes&mdash;the ones they have worked for all their lives&mdash;to move into nursing homes the government is not prepared to ensure provide certain standards
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of care. The government has often talked about family values and returning to the days when there was self-respect and community respect, where Australians treated each other with dignity and respect, particularly when relating to our elders. In my view, this bill makes a sham of that view put forward by the government. This bill does little to show respect and care for our elderly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst it was good of everyone to come, I point out that I have a few brief comments to make on the aged care legislation we are considering this morning. I want to refer to part of the introduction from the Australian Nursing Federation submission to the Senate committee inquiry into this legislation where they state&mdash;and I think these words ring true:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The public and consumers ought to be able in 1997 to have a reasonable expectation that an appropriate level and quality of care will in most circumstances be provided to nursing home residents. This reasonable expectation is due in part to previous scrutiny of nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Having said that, I think that really gets to the nub of what this legislation is about. Whilst I am not going to canvass all the issues, I think of importance from my perspective is that this piece of legislation will inevitably threaten the safe staffing levels within nursing homes and also the quality of life of the patients within those nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this legislation we will see a proposal for single funding, which removes the requirement for funding for nursing care to be quarantined from other nursing home expenditure. In the report of the Senate committee at page 56 this particular issue is addressed. Paragraph 4.13 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many organisations, including the ANF and the New South Wales Nurses Association, expressed concern at the proposed abolition of CAM funding and the adoption of single non&hyphen;equitable payment systems.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So it is this issue that is of concern today&mdash;we are going to see the care aggregate module, which looks into specific issues such as the nursing component, the personal care component, and the therapy component, collapsed into a single non&hyphen;equitable payment
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5070"> system. The basis of the care aggregate module is currently, on nominal staffing hours, 32&half; per cent for registered nurse time, 59&half; per cent for enrolled assistant nurse time, and eight per cent for therapy, which includes physiotherapy, diversional therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and podiatry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the system is accountable and currently ensures that the money is spent in accordance with the basis of the funding. So we have a system which guarantees quality care to the patients in nursing homes. The money that is not spent on the staff currently must be returned to the government. This I believe will not happen under the new system. The current system is transparent. There is certainty about it. There is predicability about it. That leads to, in turn, predictability of staffing levels and the care and the attention that will be given within nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst it was before my time, I believe that all of this arose out of the excesses in the 1960s and 1970s culminating in the Giles report in the early eighties. The Giles report, as I understand it, established clear links between staffing levels and the quality of care. Prior to the Giles report, the industry was riddled with claims of exploitation and abuse of nursing home residents. Surely we do not want a return to the past. We do not want to have to go down the path of a further Giles report in years to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current proposal, as I have said, seeks to abolish the strictly supervised funding categories that exist and have just one single non&hyphen;equitable payment system. In replacing this with the single category, there will be no requirement to justify the spending as applies under the current scheme. Whilst some people may maintain that there are some warts on the current scheme, at least it delivers a quality of care which is clearly understood, clearly defined and clearly ascertainable when one goes into a nursing home. However, we will see the removal of these requirements and this will see that there will be no nominal staffing hours as currently occurs under care. As a result, the care, I believe, of the patients in nursing homes will be compromised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Personal care and nursing costs must be kept separate from other funding to maintain
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> standards. Care will be sacrificed for profit if we go down the current path. Of course there is no substitute for quality when it comes to the care of elderly persons in nursing homes. Basically, with the single non&hyphen;equitable payment system, we will see the current strict auditing process replaced with an accreditation program for all nursing homes by the year 2000. This must lead to a weakening in the standards that must apply within the nursing homes themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once we have a system of accreditation in place and once we have a system where there is a single non&hyphen;equitable payment system, surely one must hold one's doubts as to the standards that will be maintained within particular nursing homes. Undoubtedly, what we will see is the entrepreneurs driven by the profit motive seeking to maximise their profit and thereby jeopardise the standards that apply to the elderly within their care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe we should have a market forces driven nursing home system. Currently, I understand that many nursing homes&mdash;whilst their figures are not published and part of the public record&mdash;record profits which vary between eight to 18 per cent per annum, which of themselves are not insignificant profits in this day and age. This particular measure will see the nursing standards put at risk because people will be driven by an opportunity to make even more profit than the already reasonable profit they make now. Very simply put&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7L6">Senator HOGG</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good. It really is about the standard and quality of care in nursing homes. As far as I can see, the concerns that have been expressed to me in respect of the standard of care that is given in nursing homes is well founded. This should be well and truly taken on board by this government. I do not think it is in any way addressed by the Australian Democrats in their compromise situation. I believe that we should avoid under all circumstances a return to what previously existed in the nursing home area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that I only wanted to say a few things in this debate, it is worth while looking to the Department of the Parliamentary Li
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5071"> brary report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Accommodation bonds for residential aged care: will we need to sell our homes?</EMPHASIS> I think the conclusion in that document says everything better or as well as I could ever say it myself. It is worth while putting on the record, if someone else has not already done so in the debate. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It can be argued that it is the nature of our society that those who can afford to pay and do pay receive better quality goods and services than those who cannot. It would therefore be hardly surprising if those who can afford a bond found themselves in a single ensuited room in a quiet corner of the nursing facility, whilst those who cannot share a room and a bathroom with one or more people at the front of the facility near the road.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, what needs to be ensured is that the standard of care provided is uniformly high.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And that to me is what this is about. It is about ensuring that aged people are cared for in a proper and fitting way. They look to having the registered nurse on site to care for their needs and to tend to their every concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report says `that the standard of care provided is uniformly high', and I think that there is no more important place where that applies than in the staffing of the facilities themselves. It is not only the matter of the bond, which a number of my colleagues have covered on other occasions here, but also the level of staffing. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within a facility there should be no distinction in the level of care provided to someone who has paid a bond and someone who has not. Between facilities there should be no distinction in the level of care provided at a facility occupied primarily by bond paying residents (excepting the minimum level of concessional and assisted residents) and a not for profit facility with high ratio of concessional and assisted residents.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is the dilemma that we are going to run into in this particular piece of legislation. The people who are least able to afford the quality of care will be disadvantaged because we now have everything folding into one single non&hyphen;equitable payment system which really will be without any scrutiny once the accreditation has been given. So these people in the longer term must suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the government to be very careful with this piece of legislation. I think it will cause a great deal of uncertainty out there amongst aged persons. They do want access
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to professional staff, registered nurses. They do want quality aged care but they do not want to go back to the 1960s and 1970s. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been a number of contributions to the debate on the Aged Care Bill and associated bills to date. I feel the need to address this matter also. Some significant potential consequences of this legislation do concern me. I also have some concerns about what appears to be an arrangement reached between the Australian Democrats and the government in respect of matters relating to concessional residents in nursing home facilities, and I want to deal with that. I imagine it will receive more substantial coverage when we come to the committee stage of this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to this bill, however, a primary concern has arisen out of the submissions to the inquiry undertaken by the Community Affairs References Committee of this chamber which you, Madam Acting Deputy President, chaired. In my opinion, from the witnesses to the inquiry, there was a focus on the lack of real detail provided at the stage the inquiry was held. I realise that subsequent material was provided, but I think it was difficult for some of the participants in that inquiry to grasp the totality of this package and to be satisfied that the system being put in place would be a workable one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is much concern that this lack of detail, combined with the poor consultation process, will result in the community completely misunderstanding the intent of this bill. Aged Care Australia, for example, whilst generally supporting the direction of the bill, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the government has provided insufficient information for our members to be confident that the proposals are viable and that they will enable the provision of adequate care for their residents particularly low income consumers . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that is highlighted by the fact that the subsequent statement by the minister with regard to the provision of a concessional resident subsidy has very recently been altered&mdash;and there are some comments which I will make later about that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5072">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further evidence was given to the inquiry on 23 April by Professor Picone, Executive Director of the New South Wales College of Nursing. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe the bill in its current form is only partially drafted and we would have to say that that is our area of deepest concern and therefore, it is really totally inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Also, a public meeting was held on 7 April this year at the masonic centre in Sydney. Convened by the New South Wales Aged Care Alliance, that meeting carried a resolution which, in part, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This meeting calls on the Federal and State governments to delay any implementation of proposed changes to aged and community care (including the Aged Care Bill 1997) until all impacts have been fully explored and debated . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Many of the concerns of the inquiry's witnesses centred around the question of how the low income sector of the community&mdash;perhaps better described as the sector of the community not being endowed with significant assets&mdash;given the impact of this bill, would be treated by it. Moves towards competitive service delivery and increases in the user pays systems present serious problems for older people, particularly those with a low income or asset base. It has been stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For most Australians superannuation will supplement rather than replace the aged pension in retirement . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">at least for the next 30 years&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proportion of aged pensioners with superannuation income was 9.3% up from 8.9% in June 1995. Some 62,141 or 3.9% of age pensioners were paid under the assets test. This has declined from the June 1995 level of 4.5% of age pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the data suggests that there is a higher level of financial resources among age pensioners. However the data also show that of those who do receive a full rate pension, there is an increased proportion of people with no other income . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have taken that quote from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">DSS Clients&mdash;A Statistical Overview 1996</EMPHASIS>  which, I think, was presented to the committee in a joint paper from the Alzheimers Association and others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we have at this part of the equation is the potential for a two-tier level of care which can arise from this bill. I know that some of the government senators to the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> inquiry have a different view of the matter. But allow me to develop mine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Gregory, when he inquired into the structure of nursing home funding and presented a review, I think in 1994, specifically devoted a chapter of his report to the deregulated fees model with entry contributions. He begins that chapter by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 4</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">showed that deregulated fees alone would probably lead to only a few</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">homes becoming self sufficient for capital.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Perhaps I should say that, essentially, Professor Gregory found that there was in excess of a $500 million need for capital funding to upgrade existing nursing home stock and to replace a few of the nursing homes to have a satisfactory capital structure level for the nursing home industry. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Chapter examines the possibility, which may allow more homes to become self sufficient, of allowing entry contributions as well as higher fees.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In that paragraph, under the subheading `The Nature of Admission', he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The circumstances under which clients seek access to nursing homes are considerably different from hostel clients. Approximately 60% of nursing home admissions are from hospitals. This is one indicator of the fact that nursing home entry is often urgent, motivated overwhelmingly by the need for nursing care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sheer size of entry contributions and the impact on a client's life of having to agree to sell assets to receive care would be a considerable barrier to entry. Thus, while allowing residents who can afford it to pay extra may be the fairest way to provide the extra funds needed for nursing home stock, the substantial increase in the amount that could be paid by allowing entry contributions seems too harsh a measure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even if entry contributions were only allowed for long stay nursing home residents, the emergency entry would mean that issues such as how much might be charged some time in the future are unlikely to be thought through properly when entry was being sought, leaving the resident effectively bound to whatever was agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In contrast, most people entering hostels have time to look for the hostel of their choice, taking into account factors such as how much will be charged.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There has been some attempt to suggest that there is no problem with these measures being proposed in this bill because they are modelled on the hostel regime, with some modifications, and that has worked reasonably well.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5073"> I draw attention to that passage from Professor Gregory's report to indicate that he had given consideration to the question of entry  contributions and made those findings. His summary, which appears on page 33 of the report he presented, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it would be practical to charge entry contributions to nursing home residents who stayed for a substantial period, the balance of the other factors relating to the circumstances of entry and lack of effective choice diminish it as a viable option for nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was the framework under which, I suppose it is fair to say, this government prepared its proposed regime for funding the capital needs of the nursing home sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is proposed is an arrangement whereby there is a period of grace of six months for residents who enter nursing homes. For that period, an administration fee which totals over the period, as I understand it, $1,300, can be charged. A significant number of nursing home residents stay for less than six months. There are also significant numbers of nursing home residents who stay for more than six months&mdash;I think it is approximately 60 per cent. With the bond system that is proposed, that will raise the issue for those residents of whether they have to sell their home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say `raise the issue' because the question of whether they will be concessional residents and entitled to the subsidy the minister proposes per day of occupation towards the capital cost of the home will be determined by their assets. Their assets in this case will be tested, including the family home. This is the only assets test which is applied, as I understand it, to any recipient of, for example, social security benefits where the family home is part of the assets for the purposes of the test. So the issue will arise for a number of people as to whether they are confronted with selling their home. In most circumstances, as I understand it, if a resident of a nursing home owns a home it is probable, particularly in the larger metropolitan areas, that they will have assets which put them above the level at which they would attract the government subsidy as it is proposed. That would see them faced with that choice.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Selling the home for people in those circumstances will not be essential, but if they do not sell the home they will be required to agree to accept whatever the entry contribution is as a notional figure with an amount of interest calculated on that notional figure which can be required over a period of time. That will ultimately raise the issue of selling the home, depending on their period of occupancy, and may affect other family members, for example, who live in the home either immediately or subsequently. It will also affect the decision that some elderly people will take about whether they wish to enter a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that in the senior community there is some resistance to the proposal of having to sell their homes. I know that members of this government have said, `What's wrong with people having to sell their homes?' In terms of managing the capital base of nursing homes I can understand where they are coming from. But the reality is that there are a lot of older people in the community who will strenuously resist agreeing to the concept that they will never return to their home and that they must sell it. This bill will almost require them to sell it. That will motivate people, where they have any choice, against making that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know from conversations with my parents, who are no longer with me, that there would have been strong resistance from them to the idea that the home would be sold while they were alive. They saw that as their base, their connection. My father, particularly, after my mother died, saw it as his continuing connection with my mother who he was no longer able to be with because of her death. I have no problem imagining his response to this legislation were he alive today. I believe that there are a great many people in the community who will respond to this measure in that way. They will strongly resist selling their home. They will be offended by the proposition put to them that they need to sell their home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, it will motivate some people, where they have some choice, not to go into nursing homes when it is recommended that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5074"> they do so by their doctors or other practitioners, such as nursing staff who are able to assess the condition of elderly people in their homes and recognise that these people need to have ongoing and specialist care in a  nursing home. But that resistance will arise under this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put that proposition to the government not just on the basis of the information that was put before the inquiry but on the basis of my personal experience with my family. There are probably many other senators who are able to draw on their own circumstances. There may be differing ones, but I would respectfully suggest to the government that that will be the sort of response it gets in a significant number of cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That does not even deal with the concept, for example, of a dependent daughter who has been looking after an elderly parent and living in the family home for years and who does not have an income, apart from the carer's pension, because she has become a full&hyphen;time carer. She does not have assets available to her. Such people will also be put in difficult circumstances. I will be interested to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Senator Ellison) has to say in response or during the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of talk about capping of fees and two&hyphen;tier systems. In the short time available to me, I will not be able to deal with that matter. Hopefully, I will have an opportunity, if it is not dealt with by others, to contribute during the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say in conclusion that, with regard to the money that is going to be raised by this measure&mdash;that is, the interest on the bonds lodged with proprietors and the administration fee of $2,600 per year that is able to be drawn down from the capital&mdash;I understand that it is only mandated that the draw&hyphen;down amount of $2,600 per year must be used for the purposes of capital replenishment. Firstly, am I right in that regard? Secondly, if that is the case, is that a proper measure if what we are trying to do with this bill is to create a capital base for the industry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for that reason that I asked my staffer for her thoughts on the Aged Care Bill 1997 and related measures. Lidia Argondizzo has looked after me well for some years. She prepared these words which I thought were very apt: `The aged are those we should hold in high esteem, and offer them the greatest respect and thought and not stress them with cuts and changes and more changes on an ongoing basis.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That proposition, that we should hold the aged in high esteem, is absolutely correct. In other cultures and societies it is much more readily accepted than it is here. I do not want to in any way denigrate the efforts that have been made with regard to the aged by governments of both views over the years. The introduction to the second reading speech bears that out. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Australians we all believe that we should be able to maintain the same high standard of living that we have enjoyed throughout our lives, when we become older. The vision that this government has for older Australians is to build an aged care system that will maintain comfort and dignity in a way that is viable and sustainable. To build a safe and secure future.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">People could not disagree with that. The next proposition that my staffer, Lidia Argondizzo, puts is a proposition that does require debate and has been talked about by previous speakers. She says that bean counting should not be a priority when talking about the aged, the sick and the needy. That does not mean that fiscal responsibility should not be a major
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5075"> factor in the debate about aged care, but it does mean that it should not be a priority, that there are other forces that should be allowed to work. Those forces are the natural care and affection we should have for the more elderly in the community, that we realise we live as a community, that we all have responsibilities as a society and that, to paraphrase the words of John Donne, no person is an island. It is in that context that we ought to approach this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next proposition that Lidia Argondizzo puts is that we need to understand that cost cutting undoubtedly leads to cuts in services. That is so. We should try to make sure that any cuts are not such that they will diminish the quality of care for anyone. That is a proposition that has been put before again and again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lidia Argondizzo says, `A user-pays system for our aged care is not the most user-friendly method I can think of. An entry fee will, no doubt, lead to tiered level of care. There will be many levels depending on purely how much one can pay and the service being provided accordingly.' That is a matter I need not delate on because it has been discussed by previous speakers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She also makes the comment, `The entry fee is ambiguous in itself. There is no upper limit and there is no indication of exactly what people will have to pay as an entry fee and for what reason.' By the end of the discussion on these bills, one thing we should have done is made clear just what the situation is with people going into aged care. I think that requires us to clarify two things: just what the financial issues are and just what a person is faced with when he or she goes to a nursing home. We need to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has been, I readily concede, much discussed for some time now, but one thing we could do in this debate is make clear to people listening, to people who are undertaking care of the aged and to the aged themselves&mdash;to all those people&mdash;exactly what is involved financially. If we can do that, we would make a great contribution. I think that is why the committee stage is going to be so important.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue I want to raise in this context is not so much the rights that people have under this legislation&mdash;and there are rights held by the service providers, the people who run the nursing homes, and there are rights held by the people who will use the nursing homes, the people going into them&mdash;but, more importantly, how those rights can be enforced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great issues facing us as a community at the moment is to work out how people who are recipients of services can enforce what rights they have. This is perhaps not so much in this area but in other areas where there is going to be a change from services provided by government to services provided by the private sector. Where that happens there should be a ready means for people who are recipients of those services to be able to enforce their rights. The private sector has provided a lot of aged care up till now and we have got some history as to how rights can be enforced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any legal proceedings are likely to be stressful not only for the aged but for anybody. It is essential that we as a legislature ensure as far as possible that the system we set up does not have to be enforced by legal remedies. I note that there is an amendment being suggested to set up a system of committees that will listen to complaints and will ensure that rights are enforced properly and as expeditiously and cheaply as possible. Perhaps that is a matter we can discuss in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am glad to see that Senator Ellison is taking this aged care legislation through the committee stage because he does have an appreciation of what is involved when people want to enforce rights that they have under legislation. It is not simply a matter of giving people rights; it is a matter of seeing how well and how efficiently they can be enforced so that, where the provider and the recipient of services are in conflict&mdash;not that this would happen all that often; at least I hope that the it does not arise all that often&mdash;the conflict can be resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there needs to be a remedy whereby aged people, who perhaps are more vulnerable
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5076"> than they might otherwise be and do not want to be worried by stress and strains, have a way through any conflict, whether it is potential or real, that spares them as much as possible. That is perhaps a matter that we can discuss in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is legislation that does change the situation that presently operates. There are problems in terms of the finances that are available, in terms of how people who have to use these services are going to contribute to the cost of those services. People listening to this debate have already heard those matters raised. There is the issue of rights and there is the issue of how those rights can be properly enforced. I look forward to the committee stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Aged care is a subject that I have a great deal of interest in. Before I start, I should declare some interest here as I am by profession a registered nurse, and I am a member of the New South Wales College of Nursing and of the Royal Australian College of Nursing. Both of these organisations have expressed some extreme concerns about the impact in some areas of this legislation, and I will deal with those later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been something that the government certainly has talked about&mdash;not in a great deal of detail but for quite some considerable time. When we were in government, the then opposition had several attempts at abolishing the separation of CAM and SAM, which is the care model and the other model for funding, and abolishing the acquittal of how the moneys were expended. They were not successful when they were in opposition but now they are having another go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister tabled an exposure draft of the bill in late February and gave about 15 days for the industry and everybody else to comment. This would have to be the shortest exposure draft and commenting period that I think has ever been given in the history of this parliament or any other parliaments. Not only did they leave the exposure draft for only 15 days, but also there were insufficient copies of the bill available for the industry. Some of the peak bodies and interest groups
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were able to get access to the exposure draft, but not all the nursing homes, aged care hostels and ACAT teams out there were. Many did not get a copy of that exposure draft until six to eight weeks later, and in fact members of parliament had difficulty getting hold of exposure drafts, so we could not even provide them for interested community members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not as if it was only a 10&hyphen;page document. This exposure draft was a 300&hyphen;page document. What it did not tell you and what you had to read to discover was that associated with it were a whole lot of principles. It was the principles that would be able to tell the institutions the finer details of the mechanisms involved in the administration of the changes. The principles did not come out until the end of March or early April. That was another 300&hyphen;page document. There were a few more copies of that available but it was still hard to get hold of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what happens when we get to the back page of those 300 pages? We discover that the nine key principles are yet to be released. In the interim, they have been dripping out like a leaky tap&mdash;every now and then you will get another principle coming out and another principle will be announced. There may be one week, three weeks or five weeks for the industry and for people to comment in. In fact I understand there are still some exposure documents out there from the department and the minister on which it is still open for people to comment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are being asked to pass this legislation before all the comments have been received from the industry on all the principles and all the aspects of the bill. This is like buying a pig in a poke. It would be funny and it would not be serious if it was not aged care and if it were not elderly citizens, the frail aged, the frail and people with disabilities in this community who are going to be affected&mdash;the group in the community whose members have the least ability to speak for themselves. In nursing homes something in excess of 50 per cent of the group's members have dementia and confusional problems so they may not be in a position to make considered and well&hyphen;
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5077">balanced decisions, and this is the group that this is being foisted on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are told repeatedly by the government in debate that Professor Gregory said there needed to be additional expenditure in the aged care area, and I am not disagreeing with that. As for the aged accommodation bonds, the government says forcing some of the people to sell their homes prior to admission to nursing homes will provide the increased funding level, but I have not seen anywhere any figures that clearly indicate what the expected income is for nursing homes on accommodation bonds. What the government has done though is cut its side of expenditure to nursing homes and aged care institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know now that, with some of the amendments and with some of the pressure that has been put on the minister, there have been some amendments to increase this funding. But it is ludicrous, given that the ageing population in this country is growing, mainly because in 15 years time we babyboomers will be hitting the time frame when we will start to need nursing home care and nursing home assistance. The time when this is growing is not the time to be cutting the government's commitment to aged care. It is a real worry and a real concern, but it does not seem to bother this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some grave concerns about accommodation bonds because there is no maximum level, and for the first time we are seeing, in assessing accommodation bonds, the use of the family home in assessing an asset. Not only are we seeing the use of the family home as one of the criteria for assessing an asset, but we are also seeing the contents of that family home involved. I know that in Sydney there are some family homes in which people have lived for 50 years or so where, with the passing of time and with the craziness of land prices in Sydney, those people may well be living in million dollar houses. But I will wager that those homes are probably in need of significant repairs and have a great deal of sentimental value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are a lot of places in this country where homes have not appreciated like that.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I was talking to one of the general managers of one of the councils in western New South Wales yesterday about this very issue of the provision of aged care services in his community. He estimates that something like 70, 80 or 90 per cent of the people in their institutions may have a home, but the home is of such a value that in some cases it possibly still has earthen floors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is fine, but people forget when they talk about their homes that there are still places like that in this day and age. There are still people who live in caravans out in this shire. There are still people who are not doing much more than live in tents. A huge number of people are still living in housing commission accommodation. They are gravely concerned because there is no market for the sale of their homes in this community. It is a very slow market. It is a very low market. They cannot estimate, they cannot work out, how they will get adequate revenue from the accommodation bond to make up the additional money that they will need to undertake the maintenance and refurbishment that may well be needed. It is of grave concern to these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, when we are talking about aged care and accommodation bonds, I mentioned earlier that in excess of 50 per cent of people going into nursing homes have dementia or some confusion. We have also been told by the departments that about 50 per cent of people sell their homes when they go into nursing homes. What they have not been able to tell us is whether that 50 per cent includes those with dementia or not. How will somebody who has dementia be able to undertake the sale of their home? How can we ensure that they are not ripped off; that their family will not want the home sold and the money invested because they see that as their inheritance right? That is an argument that we might want to get into at another stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern is that there are families out there who not want to see the family home sold. They will do everything they can to keep either mum or dad at home. I am assuming that most of the people in this situation are single people by this stage because their other half, their spouse, has died. They are
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5078"> single people, so they are in a situation where the home will need to be sold in order to access the accommodation bond. The only asset, the only source of income, that that family has got is the home. I am assuming that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to know if anybody has looked at what the impact will be on the workload of the Guardianship Board and the Office of Protective Commissioner, as it is called in New South Wales, and the other states' equivalents. I do not think anybody has. There will be an increase in the number of people who need to utilise the Guardianship Board and the Office of Protective Commissioner. It will also involve taking cases to the Supreme Court. The big thing with this is: does anybody know what the current timing is&mdash;how long it takes to get cases dealt with by the Guardianship Board or by the Office of Protective Commissioner or how long it takes to get cases through the Supreme Court? It takes weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this legislation changes people will be expected to sign up quite quickly. Sure, they have got six months within which to make their payments, but that can be the length of time it takes for the Guardianship Board to get all the processes through the Supreme Court alone. There will be an increase in the workload of the Supreme Court and the Guardianship Board, but there seems there be no cognisance of this or any discussions with the states about what the implications are in budgetary terms for the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are talking about the states, we also have the crazy situation where a number of the states require the nursing homes and institutions to have lodged their budgets for this coming financial year some weeks ago, yet we still have this Commonwealth government fluffing around at the last minute making decisions about what they should be doing, how they should be funding it and what the waiting time will be for the different classifications. It is only in recent times that nursing homes have been able to have a go at making some financial decisions and judgments about what their budgets are going to be for this coming financial year, yet these are the same institutions who have been
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> required by state laws to have their budgets registered with the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It strikes me that this government has not consulted. That is the cry that we have been getting for the last three months across the board from organisations within the industry: organisations that represent nursing homes and institutions, church groups, organisations that represent consumers and organisations that represent those who actually provide the hands&hyphen;on care, such as the nurses. They are all saying it. A number of them are saying, `We like accommodation bonds.' I have a problem with that. But what they are all saying is, `There has been inadequate consultation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We already know that the minister has had to defer the implementation of this legislation from 1 July this year until 1 October this year. This legislation is too hasty. There has been inadequate consultation. I know the department is going to say, `We had this meeting, this meeting and this meeting with all these organisations.' But what these organisations tell you is that the department came and told them. The department and the minister have not sat down and consulted and taken on board the various problems and issues that have been raised. As for trying to get groups and individuals in to see the minister to discuss the problems, I may as well go and talk to a brick wall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had requests in since the end of March, early April, for several organisations to meet with the minister. I am still waiting for a date. The minister has now decided that these organisations should talk to the department first, and then she may decide to meet with them. Some of these organisations are in the business of the provision of aged care. They know how aged care is administered. They know all the problems. They do it every day, five days a week&mdash;and probably for a lot longer in their own personal time. They are being told, `Oh, talk to the department and we'll see if we can't sort the problems out.' This has been going on for months. I find that highly unsatisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I run out of time, I want to raise a key issue of concern which, as I said earlier,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5079"> with my nursing experience and background, I share with the two colleges and with the unions: nowhere in the bill does it stipulate that nursing care has to be provided by registered or enrolled nurses or by people with training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a grave concern to those in the industry, because we have seen over a period of time that the sickness and the debilitation of the residents of nursing homes have in creased. There are now many more residents with multisystem problems. When I was involved in aged care, it was a lot of hard, heavy, basic nursing care. Certainly, in a nursing home you very rarely saw the use of even oxygen and there was no intravenous therapy. Now it is not at all uncommon for people to have intravenous therapy in nursing homes. Oxygen is frequently used. They are even using hyperalimentation, that is, ventral feedings, which is feeding via tubes either into the stomach or into one of the major blood vessels, to provide adequate nutrition. I am told by the colleges that we are seeing people who are on dialysis in nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is helping to relieve the pressure on the acute care  hospital system, but it also means that because of the level of nursing care provided in the nursing homes they absolutely need registered nurses. If you look closely, there are a number of procedures that, legally, should be provided by registered nurses. But there seems to be nothing in this legislation that is going to ensure that aged people in nursing homes are provided with adequate nursing care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw your attention to a discussion paper by Julienne Onley, Professional Officer of the New South Wales College of Nursing, titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The importance for the Australian community of maintaining a professional nursing presence in residential aged care facilities</EMPHASIS>. It deals with high levels of acuity and associated care needs. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The findings of studies reported by Rantz and Naylor are supported by Australian researchers, O'Hara, Hart, Robinson and McDonald (1996). Their findings indicate that, in a study conducted by a major Victorian teaching hospital, 30% of patients who were transferred to long term care facilities died within four days. Older age was reported as a significant factor in death after discharge,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whether to long term care facilities or elsewhere. Of the 60 to 69 year age group, 21.6% died within 28 days of discharge, in the 70 to 79 year age group the percentage was 31.3%, and in the 80 plus group, 29.9%.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The authors question the timeliness of transfer as a factor in the higher rates of death within a shorter period of time for those transferred to long term care, saying they may have been "in extremis and less salvageable than patients who were transferred to other acute treatment centres".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The quote in that last sentence is from O'Hara et al 1996:47.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The quote from Onley's discussion paper continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . or they may not have been expected to recover anyway. Their findings indicate the need for a high level of nursing care, including palliative care skills, in long term care facilities which receive patients transferred from the acute care sector.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That quote opens up a whole minefield of ramifications for the changes that are taking place in the aged care industry. I also quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Collegian</EMPHASIS> , the journal of the Royal College of Nursing, Australia, Volume 4, No. 2, April 1997. Part of the editorial, titled `Unregulated care workers . . . the thin edge of the wedge', by Helen Hamilton, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Deregulation has meant that care is provided according to the type of organisation in which the person is located, and sets aside the concept of providing care in accordance with the needs of clients. Nursing homes and hostels provide a significant amount of care with unregulated workers. It is little wonder, then, given the high levels of medical intervention and increased use of technologies, that there are all&hyphen;too&hyphen;frequent anecdotal reports of unregulated workers providing care well past their level of skill and competence, raising concerns about the quality of care provided.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This has just scraped the surface of this major issue. In fact, the department did not include the Royal College of Nursing in its consultations in the initial stages, because they had not even realised that the Royal College of Nursing is in fact the organisation, along with the New South Wales one, that is there to provide the professional standards for nurses in this country. They were ignored. That is the sort of lack of consultation that has taken place. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is obviously a lot of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5080"> emotion in this debate. I believe this is appropriate, because the interesting thing about politics in the last few years is that the word `certainty' is used by industry to beat governments around the head. It is used as an excuse to remove the rights of workers and of indigenous Australians and to trash the environment. It seems that industry, especially big industry, has the right to certainty. Whatever  they want they often get. Often, they are fully involved in the discussion, they have put forward the suggestions in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what about the certainty that ordinary people want? What about the certainty of people who are concerned about their lives as they move into their elderly years? What sort of certainty is it when the government has used the two&hyphen;thirds rule in order to shove through a piece of legislation which should have been carefully considered and is going to affect everybody in one way or another in our community? The legislation is creating a great deal of uncertainty in our community and the government has used a mechanism to try to shove it through without proper community consultation&mdash;I mean `community' consultation. We have had it at the eleventh hour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a dreadful version of the ideological preference for user pays and government cuts. We are going to be moving from duty of care to duty of profit or duty of governments to provide profit. In the end, what we will be doing with this badly thought&hyphen;out proposal that we are being asked to consider is consigning the elderly to the market&mdash;often when they are in the least favourable position to be able to make choices. If large amounts of money are involved, that level of fear that many people have about what their final years might be will be exacerbated&mdash;the fear that basically that choice may become a one&hyphen;way street or become very difficult to reverse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How many of us have experienced the situation where people we know of or relatives have gone into a facility, have been concerned about it, and then have been taken out by relatives immediately or at some later time? Loving families do not always know immediately about the quality of care that is
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provided because people who are consigned to that care are not always capable of properly articulating their concerns about their treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is a dreadful situation when people can be forced to make large contributions but are not guaranteed quality care. Even in those nursing homes that are providing quality care, we will find that the market will force them to reduce that level of care so as to cut employment costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be spending more time on these bills. There is an unseemly rush to deal with something of such major importance to all Australians. And I am not the only one who believes this. Yesterday, the Australian Nursing Federation put out a press release entitled `Aged Care Bill 1997&mdash;Democrats let residents and staff down'. I will quote from this press release:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Nursing Federation (ANF) today slammed the Australian Democrats and their Aged Care spokesman, Senator John Woodley, for caving in to the Federal Government over the Aged Care Bill 1997 and failing to force changes that would keep nursing home proprietors honest in terms of staffing levels, nursing care and the cost to residents and their families of accommodation bonds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANF acting federal secretary, Denis Jones, said the break&hyphen;neck speed at which they sought to do a deal with the Government has sidelined the issues of cost to consumers and accountability in the use of Government funding.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yes, there is government funding used here, and we are talking about outcomes&mdash;those things we do not properly consider in the rush to privatisation and user pays. The press release goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He criticised Senator Woodley for his selective representations to the Government on behalf of church organisations, because they ignored the interests of aged care staff and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"They also ignored the fact a Senate Report on this Bill has been tabled and is still to be considered. The interests of nursing home proprietors have been put ahead of residents.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is not good enough. It is not good legislation. The argument cannot be made or pulled through in this debate that what has been achieved by this very fast deal is a great advance for aged care or for the elderly. It is not. If it was such an advance, we would be
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5081"> taking the time to look at it properly. But this is not being done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The suggestion that this legislation should have been held over until at least next year is a very good one. Other than the government wanting to pull out of its responsibilities to provide quality aged care for people in Australia, I cannot see any justification at all for proceeding now. The government wants to make sure that people are involved in user pays; it does not want to be responsible. That is the only reason I can think of for pushing this through with such unreasonable haste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be commercial considerations here, but these should not be our primary motivation. Our primary motivation should be outcomes. And our primary motivation should not just be outcomes for aged care but outcomes for people who are concerned about their living choices in their final years. We should not be doing this to our aged population; we should be thinking about how we can be a caring and reasonable society and how we can act reasonably, compassionately and responsibly in the use of public funds. I think the speed in this matter is deplorable, and I do not support the fast tracking of these bills.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in opposition to the Aged Care Bill and related bills. Senator Margetts has just read from the Australian Nursing Federation press release regarding the agreement reached between the government and the Australian Democrats on certain aspects of the bills. It has been a very hasty agreement that has been reached, I agree, and I also agree that we need a much longer period of time to consider the legislation because the amendments agreed to by the government and the Democrats demonstrate that the legislation has not been thought through thoroughly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is very important legislation which proposes very important changes to the aged care system in Australia. It is of importance to Tasmania because the ABS statistics indicate that the aged population in Tasmania will be significantly higher on average than that of the national population. The ABS estimates that the proportion of the population aged 65 and over in Tasmania will be between 28.2
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> per cent and 32 per cent by the year 2051, yet nationally the statistics indicate that the proportion of people aged 65 and over by 2051 will only be between 22.5 per cent and 24.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any final agreement we get on the Aged Care Bill will have an important impact on Tasmania because of the fact that we now have and will have a significant degree of people over 65 in our population compared to the national average. And, of course, our economic circumstances are significantly worse than those in most other states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does this legislation seek to do? Firstly, it seeks to cut the guts out of public funding for aged care in Australia. In 1996, the government cut more than half a billion dollars out of aged care funding. I think the effect and the impact of that are yet to be felt, and we are going to see a significant decline in aged care facilities. There is the fact that the government has, in part, used as its argument for this legislation the report that identified that Australia's nursing homes were suffering. The infrastructure spending was some $900 million short of bringing them up to what is currently the standard that is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I cannot see the logic of cutting public funding at a time when we do not know whether or not this proposal from the government can even meet those funding needs. Of course, the proposal is to introduce a system of accommodation bonds. What is an accommodation bond? An accommodation bond is something that, apparently, a potential resident for a nursing home negotiates with the potential provider of the service. There is no particular level that the accommodation bond can be, except that I think it has to be above $13,000. A person who has no financial means other than their home will have to sell their home&mdash;which the government says you do not have to do&mdash;to provide the bond. So a single person will be left with $22,500, and a couple will be left with $45,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government put out a series of question and answer papers to explain their new legislation. As I said, in terms of the accommodation bond, they say, `Well, you negotiate it. So long as a single person is left with
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5082"> $22,500 or a couple is left with $45,000, that is all we are really interested in.' There are no real prudential arrangements in place to ensure that, although the Democrats somehow think that they have achieved an agreement for an independent tribunal in each state to consider any disputes in relation to aged care matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, before we even get to that point, we already know that it is very difficult for aged  care recipients around this country to actually know whether or not they are being ripped off. There would be many aged care nursing home claims. Over time we have seen claims where people have not been receiving the level of service and the level of care that they ought. They have been ripped off. We really do not know, from a financial point of view, whether or not people are being ripped off. There have been a number of claims that they have been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was one claim in particular in my own state, and I am quite curious about the government's position, because I have raised this matter before in terms of the standard. They say, `Well, nursing homes that do not meet the standards that we set down cannot charge accommodation bonds and should not receive funding.' There is a nursing home in Launceston called Cadorna House, and there are claims that the management of Cadorna House have been ripping off the residents. The home does not meet the standards, yet it received government funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be very curious when we get into the committee stage of this legislation to hear some explanation about how the government intends to deal with these issues. What is going to happen to some of these homes that do not meet the standards, as they currently are, and have been receiving government funding? It is going to be very interesting to turn around now and say to them, `Look, you can't charge an accommodation bond until you get up to standard.' They have residents there. In the case of Cadorna House, in particular, I think $500,000 was needed to bring it up to standard. If you look at the accommodation bond and the application of it in terms of it being the new provider of infrastructure and redevelopment and mainte
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nance funds, as I understand it, the legislation says that current residents do not have to pay an accommodation bond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are talking about replacing hundreds of millions of dollars of infrastructure funding over the course of the next two, three or four years that was taken out of the 1996 budget. If existing residents do not have to pay a bond, how are homes going to generate sufficient income? What about those who can negotiate accommodation bonds? Where are they going to get all of this magical money from? How will those private homes and some of the charitable homes manage? Some will manage. The private sector ones will manage. Some of them probably already charge some form of bond or entry fee. They will benefit, I would think, if now you have legislation that says there must be an accommodation bond. They will benefit significantly, and they may well have standards within their nursing homes that are above standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it really comes down to where the fairness and the equity are in that sort of an approach. I guess that is why the government gave in to the Democrats' pressure, albeit small amount of pressure, and increased the daily fees in those homes that have between 40 per cent and 100 per cent of concessional residents, who are charged $12 per day. Why did they do that? That surely is a clear acknowledgment that there are going to be real problems with those homes that have concessional residents, and that is a significant number of them, probably the vast majority. How will they derive their money to either maintain the standard of the home or upgrade the home to meet the standard? There is no answer in this legislation for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose the converse of that is, where you have a home that already meets the standard and is doing very nicely and can charge an accommodation bond now through legislated means, the owners of the home may well pocket the interest earned. There is nothing in the legislation that says there is an obligation that the interest earned from the money that is banked by the home has to be put back into the system and the maintenance of care for
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5083"> the residents of those homes. There is nothing at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You may well see around this country that some homes that are privately owned and do meet the standards are able to profit from this legislation. Then we will have the others that are desperate and have residents that do not have the financial wherewithal to actually pay an accommodation bond or pay the types of fees we are talking about, and they will battle and struggle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this legislation goes through without significant further amendment we are going to end up with a two&hyphen;tiered aged care system in Australia. There is no doubt about that. There is one to a limited degree now. This will draw a very distinct line between socioeconomic groups in different states. My state in particular is going to end up with a substandard arrangement in terms of aged care. There is no doubt about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has allocated $10 million for 1997-98 for infrastructure funding. That is nowhere near enough. I received a letter from an operator of a nursing home who said that it would be an abrogation of the government's responsibility if it were to cease public funding of nursing homes before such time as the standards have been achieved. That is right. Some people do not have the financial wherewithal to actually contribute. Those homes that will have to say, `You will have to sell your home to pay to come in here,' will not be able to attract residents. They will be head hunting people who have homes of higher value so that they can get more money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just like the Australian banking system. The banks do not want to know the punters that have no money. That is what you are going to breed into aged care in this country. You are going to develop a system where those people who do not have significant amounts of money and do not do reasonable transactions that are in the interests of the banks of this country will be fobbed off to a building society or friendly society to do their banking. They will be left out in the cold. That is what is going to happen to a lot of aged people in Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to deal with the accreditation system and standards. I am curious about the government saying that until nursing homes reach the standard they cannot charge an accommodation bond, but a resident can agree to go into a home on the basis that when the home achieves accreditation and meets the standards they can pay an accommodation bond. I come back to the question: how do those homes get there in the first place?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen homes in Tasmania close down because they do not meet the standards. On the basis of the income they derived under the old system where they actually had infrastructure funding, they could not meet the standards. Why would homes not seek out those people who can pay. Of course they will. Another question I put to the government is: why should a person be forced to sell their home at a time of depressed housing prices? Why should they be forced to sell their home because the time has arrived when they need to go into a nursing home and there is a depressed housing market in a particular state and region and therefore the real value of that property that might be realised cannot be realised due to the economic circumstances in that region or state. Therefore, they could be looking down the barrel of having to sell their home for a much reduced price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should people have to do that? Why should that be the case? Why should we not have a fairer system for people? Surely the government has a responsibility to actually provide for&mdash;and I remember the old slogan `for all of us'&mdash;all of them on an equal basis. From a government point of view we should provide for Australia's aged people equally. This legislation does not do that and, at the moment, has no hope of doing it. Even with the very small changes that the Democrats have negotiated&mdash;and I note Senator Woodley has come into the chamber&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appeal to you, Senator Woodley, that these changes are simply not enough. We have to seek a far greater explanation of this from the government and ensure that, at the end of the day,

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge senators to have a long debate and give this serious consideration. The opposition has a number of amendments. They will at least go some way to making this legislation a lot better than it currently is and will make it a lot fairer than it is. I hope that the Democrats will take note of that and will see their way clear to support what would be some very positive changes to the legislation. The  one underpinning problem I think the government has is that this will not deliver an equitable system. I think one of the greatest shames in terms of the government's proposal to change something that affects people is that they will deliver something that is going to make a very unfair, two&hyphen;tiered aged care system in this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;At the outset I thank honourable senators from the opposition, the Democrats and the Greens for their contributions. The aged care bills before the Senate today represent a fresh start for aged care in this country and a chance to build a better future. The history of aged care in this country is one of change. As the Senate Community Affairs References Committee acknowledged, we have an ageing population and increasing demand. It is this dynamic which has required aged care to evolve to meet new challenges as they arise. I wish to acknowledge the work of the committee and note in particular the efforts of the chair, Senator Bishop, the deputy chair, Senator Knowles, and also Senator Woodley from the Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The structures we have in place today were appropriate for their time but they do not meet today's challenges and they are not sustainable. The government's reforms embodied in these bills address today's pressing issues and put in place a structure which will support quality care and accommodation in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the future. Our reforms will ensure major and sustained investment in nursing home buildings and infrastructure&mdash;investment which will deliver the quality home&hyphen;like accommodation, privacy, dignity and comfort that older Australians deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some opposition senators have also claimed that these reforms will take $550 million out of the system. This is utter nonsense. This package provides for older people who can pay a little more to do so and the $550 million is not a cut on previous government outlays. In fact, each year expenditure is growing steadily, reflecting the growth in the older population. The opposition claims capital funds have reduced, but I note in the last year of Labor's government capital funds for nursing homes were only $10 million and that could not hope to meet the demands or the recommendations made by the Gregory report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, while I am on that, let me just say that it is utter hypocrisy for the opposition to attack this government for trying to reform aged care because it is 10 years, since 1987, when the opposition introduced the CAM and SAM modules. In that 10 years nothing has happened. In fact, while the Labor government was in power they were called on repeatedly to address the issue of capital funding and to address the problems in aged care. Before my time in this place I noticed that Senators Patterson and Knowles raised these issues repeatedly. Senator Patterson from Victoria and my colleague from Western Australia Senator Knowles repeatedly called on the then government to do something about aged care. Today they will not be speaking in an effort to minimise the amount of time that this bill takes so that it can get through this week&mdash;that is the urgency that we face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition should not misrepresent the facts about the Gregory report and misquote aspects of it to suit themselves. The Gregory report, which the opposition commissioned when it was in government, stated that there was a need for ongoing funding of $125 million if the aged care system was not to fall over. The opposition should not misrepresent the facts about the family home. Nobody will
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5085"> be forced to sell the family home. It is specifically protected where there is a spouse or dependent child in the home and there are also protections for close family members and long-term carers. This, I believe, answers Senator O'Brien's claim that family members would be disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator O'Brien also raised concerns about accommodation bonds. I would point out to Senator O'Brien that services must refund all of a person's bond except for the modest retention amount of $2,600 each year for a total period of five years. There are specific protections for the family home in the cases  I have mentioned. In other cases, there are a range of payment choices that will allow people to pay an accommodation bond other than by selling their home. It is on this point that Labor should be condemned for their fear campaign. They are responsible for causing alarm amongst a group of vulnerable people in our community. Labor does not have the facts. It does not have a strong enough argument to attack this well&hyphen;considered aged care package, and it must be remembered that it did nothing when it was in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reforms that we have before us will bring the focus back to the individual. The new funding system will bring an equitable distribution of funding according to need and, more particularly, ensure that people are funded according to their care need and not according to what sort of building they are in. Another aspect is the improved funding for dementia care. That is a major objective of these reforms. Funding for the average hostel resident with dementia will increase by 30 per cent. The industry has been crying out for proper funding for dementia care for years and they strongly support the changes we are making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, I received a copy of a letter sent to Senator Harradine from Mr Peter Miller, the President of the ADARDS Nursing Home&mdash;a specialist dementia nursing home in Tasmania. Mr Miller says that in the past governments have declined to acknowledge the cost of dementia care. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be catastrophic if this legislation was not passed.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Miller goes on to support the introduction of accommodation bonds. He says that this is a positive measure that will ensure building quality. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other alternative is to do nothing and let nursing home stock deteriorate and eventually close for want of maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I point out to those people who want to put this legislation off till next year or, as Senator Margetts says, until at least next year, that we do not have the luxury of time. We have to act now if we are to be responsible as a government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Forshaw said that the government had lied about accommodation bonds and the difference between nursing homes and hostels. He said nursing homes and hostels were so different that you should not extend the system currently in place in hostels to nursing homes. Senator Forshaw, I would submit, with respect, is living in the past. Let us face it: there is now a significant overlap between nursing homes and hostel residents. Probably 50 per cent of dementia hostel residents would be eligible for nursing home care. Many older people tell us that they want to age in place; they do not want to move from a hostel to a nursing home. This reiterates and reinforces the point that the government is making. We do not want this existing two-tiered system to carry on. We want to combine the two systems into one for the benefit of older people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reforms also bring a new approach to quality care&mdash;a new approach which will involve industry and consumers as partners in pursuit of quality care, an approach which will bring incentives for quality and excellence as well as swift action for non&hyphen;performance. I would point out to Senator Bishop who said this was only a cost cutting measure that we are interested most importantly in outcomes and not just cost cutting. It is in fact our preoccupation with outcomes that causes this government to address this important issue at this time and not put it off until next year or the year after, as others would have us do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These reforms bring substantial improvements to consumer protection. We have built
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5086"> on the existing framework to ensure much stronger and clearer protections than the existing system provides&mdash;protections for spouses and dependent children for carers and family, protections to ensure that access to care is based on need and need alone, not means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the government's reform package has been considered by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee. That committee has issued a report, together with minority reports from government senators and the Democrats. It is important to acknowledge that this report makes some useful and constructive suggestions to improve the reform package. In fact, of the 28 recommen dations, you will find that, if not in whole, in part, most of those recommendations are to be found in this reform package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has listened to these concerns, as I have said, and has decided accordingly to make three major policy changes in response. I will now deal with each of those in turn and explain them. The first relates to an independent complaints mechanism. I have talked about the importance of quality care and the moves the government will take to secure improvements here. But it is also important to recognise that a vital part of any quality assurance system needs to be the people's right to complain and have their complaints addressed fairly. I believe this is the point Senator Cooney raised. It is vital that consumers are able to complain about any aspect of an aged care service that makes them unhappy. Similarly, providers need to be able to complain about actions by the department. It is always preferable that, where problems arise, they can be promptly resolved by those concerned in the individual facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the government agrees that all parties to the aged care reforms should have access to an external complaints handling system. The bill currently makes it the responsibility of service providers to operate an internal complaints mechanism, to advise people of any other complaints mechanisms that are available to address complaints and to allow access for authorised officers to investigate and assist in resolving complaints.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has listened to a range of concerns as to how this will operate in practice. These indicate that the community is looking for an independent mechanism for resolving complaints, a mechanism which is clearly promoted and accessible to everyone. The Australian Democrats have also raised these issues with the minister. They have been very focused on consumer outcomes, and the Democrats have made a strong case. We have responded to these concerns. We now propose to implement a comprehensive complaints handling system which is not connected to the complaints mechanism operating in each facility and propose two amendments to the bill to carry this out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a well-known, easily identified contact point for anyone wanting to make a complaint, supported by a well publicised free call phone number. There will be complaints units under the auspices of the department providing national coverage through staff skilled to handle and resolve the complaint in a timely manner. The complaints units will work to committees which include community representatives who will review and evaluate the operations of the complaints handling system and will have the power to make determinations, where necessary, to resolve the complaints. The committees will report to the minister on a regular basis. The complaints units will be able to refer standards issues to the Aged Care Standards Agency and possible breaches of legislative requirements, such as overcharging accommodation bonds, to the department for action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where the department confirms a breach of legislative requirements, it will also inform the standards agency to ensure that this is considered in deciding a facility's accreditation. Where an issue arises which the complaints handling system does not have statutory power to handle, referrals will be made to other more appropriate bodies. This approach will allow people's complaints to be handled independently and fairly. It will ensure that, where necessary, action is taken to resolve them. This I believe takes care of any opposition concerns about the enforcement of people's rights. Another aspect is the funding for concessional residents. The
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5087"> minister has listened to concerns from the Democrats and also from some of the churches who are major providers of aged care. As I said, this government has a paramount concern to ensure equality of access for all. There are a combination of strategies in place which relate to this. Assessment teams, mandatory quotas and a supplement as an added incentive will achieve exactly that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were, however, concerns that providers who care for a large number of concessional residents, often providers in poorer areas of Australia, would not be able to generate enough funding to maintain building quality over time under the $5 supplement that the government had previous ly proposed. We had strong representations from the Uniting Church, the Anglican Church and the Catholic Church. The minister consulted with the Democrats at length on this issue. It is appropriate to acknowledge in particular the contribution of Senator Woodley, who is in the chamber today, and Senator Lees. They were strong and effective advocates for a different approach, and I thank them on behalf of the government for their willingness to engage in constructive dialogue and to grapple with the real policy issues which underlie this complex issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has developed a response which meets these concerns and which she believes has the endorsement of these key players. The new arrangements will provide for a $7 a day concessional resident supplement for those facilities which cater for up to 40 per cent concessional residents. Facilities which have over 40 per cent, those primarily being religious and charitable operators who pursue a mission to care for the financially disadvantaged, will receive $12 a day for each of their concessional residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the assisted resident supplement has been increased from $2 per day to $3.50 per day. This new structure will provide maximum support to those facilities which specialise in concessional residents. It provides an unprecedented level of recurrent funding to those facilities and will enable them to maintain quality accommodation over the long term. I am sure that this measure will be widely supported in the aged care industry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final policy change that I have mentioned is that of commitment to review of the aged care package. This change highlights the willingness of the minister and the government to listen to the concerns of the community and those in the aged care field. From the beginning, when the minister announced the structural reform package back in the 1996 budget, the intention was to work with stakeholders in developing detailed arrangements to take account of their concerns and to create a system which was workable and practical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has had the audacity to suggest that there has not been sufficient consultation on these reforms. Let me say that this reform package has been on the table as a result of the budget last year, and has been open for discussion since February this year&mdash;not to mention the four working groups and a number of subgroups that have been working constantly to develop these reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was, for instance, the funding and implementation issues working group, which considered the major funding and policy arrangements; the accreditation working group, which is developing the new quality assurance system and the standards agency; and the technical reference group, which oversaw the development of the new resident classification instrument; and the certification working group, which developed the building certification process. These people will tell you that they felt they were actually being listened to, that they were actually contributing and that they were partners in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister intends to maintain this theme of consultation and partnership in the implementation of these reforms. The government commits itself to reviewing the aged care package, once implemented, as follows. Within three months of implementation&mdash;that is, from the date of proclamation&mdash;the government will review the operation of the resident classification scale to ensure that the relative care needs of residents have been adequately determined, and that the resident classification scale is operating consistently with the government's objectives. This review will also consider the implementation of the resident classification scale and, in particular,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5088"> the training of staff to ensure that this is adequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following implementation of the package, the government will commence an overall review, including the effect of the subsidy scale of $7 per concessional resident for facilities, which takes up 40 per cent, and a flat rate of $12 for every concessional resident for those facilities catering for over 40 per cent of concessional residents. This will enable both the policy and its implementation to be reviewed in an ongoing fashion over the course of two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's two-year review will be chaired by an independent person who will be assisted by a committee comprising industry,  consumer, union and departmental representatives. The review will consider evidence from all parties involved in the reform process, and will incorporate the capacity for recommendations such as remedial funding for inadequate care subsidies. While the review will be expected to monitor issues relating to the ongoing implementation of the package, it will also be expected to deliver a progress report at 12 months and two years. These reports will be tabled in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Acting Deputy President, I know that you have had a long interest in aged care, and I believe these changes that the government has announced today will strengthen the reforms and help to ensure that older Australians get the quality care and accommodation they deserve now and into the future. It is time that the opposition realised that it is alone in the community on this issue and that, with these policy changes, with these reviews, with the independent committee looking at complaints, we now have a reform package that will deliver to older Australians but with ongoing protections to ensure that this reform package does what it was set out to do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will agree to the three amendments that have been circulated by the government. We are currently
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dealing with amendments 1 and 2. Each of the amendments relates to the establishment and activities of complaints committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened very closely to the parliamentary secretary in his closing remarks in the second reading debate. I would like to make two comments leading into consideration of some issues that arise out of the government's amendments. Whilst we will not oppose these amendments, in our view there is still a long way for this government to go&mdash;and, indeed, the Democrats agreed with the government in this respect yesterday&mdash;before it gets this legislation right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Ellison said that the opposition, the Labor Party, was alone out there in respect of issues relating to this legislation. I can assure Senator Ellison that that is far from the case. If you have a look at my in&hyphen;tray and the letters that I have received and that the shadow minister and members of the opposition have received even as recently as a day ago complaining about this legislation and expressing their concerns about it, then you will see that we are not alone. In fact, we are very much in tune with the expressions of concern by providers and people affected by this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Ellison tried to indicate that this was legislation that was going to take us into a new era and that the Labor government had done nothing whilst it was in power. Again, we reject that, and as we come to deal with the issues in the legislation during the committee stage, we will be pointing out quite clearly just what the former government did to advance the provision of aged care over the course of our years in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to these amendments, I want to turn to the media release and the announcement made yesterday by the government and the Democrats regarding the deal that they have reached whereby the Democrats were prepared to support the legislation this week rather than deferring it to allow further opportunities for people with all these concerns to continue to negotiate with the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The deal that has been reached between the Democrats and the government goes to two key areas. The first part of the agreement
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5090"> relates to the concessional resident subsidy,  which we will no doubt come to later. We have welcomed this as an improvement and as a recognition by the government that its original proposal was totally inadequate, but it still does not go far enough. The second part of the agreement relates to the review of the entire aged care reform package in two years, annual reporting to parliament and a review of the operation of the single instrument within three months. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have made great play about this aspect of their deal with the government. They claim that they have forced the government to undertake a complete, independent, wholesale review of this legislation in two years and that they will also be conducting a review very soon, after three months operation, of some key aspects of the legislation. They have put great store in this. What they say is, `There are still a lot of concerns out there; we're  going to be monitoring them and we've forced the government to establish procedures whereby this monitoring will be undertaken.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government came back into this debate and brought in amendments which arose out of its acknowledgment of concerns expressed by the industry, the opposition, the Democrats and other minor parties, you would have thought that they would have come back with proposals that gave effect to what is highlighted in the Democrats' announcement about a deal on this legislation. But, no, there is nothing at all in these amendments that in any way relates to the establishment of a process of full review. There is nothing in here which relates to the establishment of an independent review of the entire legislation. There is nothing in here that relates specifically to having a review after the act has been in operation for three months; rather, what these amendments deal with is specifically related to the reviewing and resolution of complaints about matters dealt with in the Aged Care Bill or in the principles made in relation to the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments fall a long way short of expressing what it is that the Democrats have claimed they have negotiated with the government and what the government has stated. Senator Ellison, in his closing remarks in the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> second reading debate, directed a lot of attention to this. It was said that the government was going to get this legislation through the parliament this week. That is the government's intention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding the fact that they claim they have got experts on their side of the parliament who have long followed this issue&mdash;and Senator Ellison named them and said that they had actually decided not to get involved in the debate in an effort to push this legislation through this week, just as they used their numbers in the House to guillotine it through in a matter of a few hours a couple of weeks ago&mdash;they have said that they are not going to get their so&hyphen;called expert speakers in here to even debate these issues. These issues are still of major importance to the aged community, to the people involved in providing aged care services and to the families of the elderly who, of course, are dramatically affected by this legislation and by decisions that have to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what do we get? We get these amendments which only amend, in a minor way, provisions in the legislation which relate to the reviewing and the resolution of complaints. I would ask the parliamentary secretary and the Democrats how they can reconcile the agreement that they have supposedly made and have trumpeted so loudly out there in the community, which is to provide for a wholesale review of the legislation, with these very simple and straightforward amendments which only relate to dealing with complaints. I ask the parliamentary secretary to respond to that. You would have thought, as I said, that the key element of the deal would have been reflected in amendments that the government was bringing back in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note in the explanatory memorandum that has been circulated that it also acknowledges that the amendments will allow for the establishment of an independent committee or committees to coordinate and review the resolution of complaints made by aged care recipients or their representatives about aged care services, facilities or the administration of the aged care legislation. That is not what the deal is supposed to cover.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5091">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have some questions that I wish to put to the parliamentary secretary in due course about the formation of these committees. I think we can get on to that shortly, but I would ask the parliamentary secretary and the Democrats&mdash;and I would be interested to hear what the Democrats have to say&mdash;just how it is that these amendments reflect the deal that they have made that they say is so important.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by just going back a little bit for Senator Forshaw. The actual amendments we are dealing with now together by leave are government amendments Nos 1 and 2. Therefore, we are only dealing with those amendments relating to complaints resolution. I will go back over the negotiations that the Democrats had with the government, with the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) and with the churches.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The specific issues on the table for the industry related to the actual amount that they were going to get for those people who were not going to be able to pay any sort of a contribution by way of a bond. Also they related to the two reviews: firstly, the three-month review&mdash;if I can clarify that for Senator Forshaw, that is just about the single instrument&mdash;and, secondly, the longer review, the two-year review, which is really an overview of the legislation itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put on the table during those discussions and that debate another issue that was of concern to me and to Senator Woodley, following evidence given at some of the hearings, having read the various submissions and letters that, no doubt, you have also received and having listened to the phone calls and contacts from the industry. They wanted a resolution of some of the issues in nursing homes, which in some cases have been unresolved for many years. I have been in the unfortunate position where I have had to go through the processes of reporting homes. There were not easy resolution processes, believe me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as the issues the industry pursued as its primary interests in those last few days
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of discussions, the complaints issue was taken up by me as a specific thing I wanted to see resolved in order to really take notice of those last minute letters some of which are still coming in, the longer term complaints and problems that have been within the industry as well as the various comments that were made during the committee process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are setting up here with these two amendments is only that last resolution process. We are not doing any more. We will discuss the other amendments as we come to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, we wanted a one-stop shop. We did not want people to have to look around as to where their particular complaint belonged, who they should ring and which department they should go to. How were they ever going to get to square one? We wanted a single authority that could make the basic decision as to whether it could deal with it, whether the minister should really see it or whether it could go out into a range of other possible areas and be dealt with back there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the understanding we have, the basic format is that there will be five complaints committees: one over in the Western Australia, one for South Australia and the Northern Territory, one for Victoria and Tasmania, one for New South Wales and the ACT, and one for Queensland. Based in the relevant capital cities, they will be supported by existing Department of Health and Family Services complaints staff in those cities. You will have to agree that is adequate national coverage. If the parliamentary secretary could add any more details there, we would be quite happy to have those now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The complaints committees will also include people who are external to the departments, independent representatives. Because the complaints committees are being established under the auspices of departments, their decisions will be subject to review and appeal under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Complaints can be made by anyone, as I said. It may be a complaint from a resident, a family member or a service provider. Indeed, it could be a complaint from staff,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5092"> employees. A few of the late faxes I am getting through I believe will be sorted out once people understand how the legislation works, but, if some of those complaints continue, this is the sort of body that could handle those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those complaints can then go off perhaps to the minister or to one of the independent review bodies that we have just set up. I think particularly the two-year review will be hearing some of the messages that are coming through to the complaints body. It may be a complaint that should be handled by the state. It may be an issue under state regulations that has been overlooked, that is not being dealt with and that has to be referred back to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The determination has to be within the ambit of the act and its principles. So there is some limit as to what the complaints committee can force a provider or the department to do. There are still some specific issues to be discussed here. We will get some more details  as we look at how it is all going to be worded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The intention is that the complaints committees would only make determinations as a last resort. Their prime function is as a clearing house. I suspect, from looking at some of the issues referred to me, some of that will go straight back to the state. But people still need the confidence and they still need to understand they have one place they can go where the problems can be sorted out for them. They are not going to get the run&hyphen;around. They are not going to be shuffled between various departments and between various levels of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that Senator Forshaw has a better understanding of what we are doing now. I will let my colleague Senator Woodley go through and talk through this with you, if you so wish. I stress again that this is separate from the reviews; we are looking at government amendments Nos 1 and 2. Then the parliamentary secretary can answer any additional questions as well on the reviews.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lees, I am quite aware
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the fact that these amendments relate to that issue of the complaints. The point that I was making is that what the Democrats have signed off relates to reviews of the legislation. There are no other amendments coming from the government, and I do not see any from the Democrats, that put into place in the legislation a capacity for that wholesale review to occur in two years, for a review in three months and for a single instrument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only measure that exists in the legislation is this one that relates to handling of complaints from individuals. Senator Lees has spoken about that and, as I have said, we do not object to that. We will support these amendments, but there are no other amendments that reflect this agreement. The point that we are trying to make and to which we want some answers is: why not? At the end of the day, what you are left with is simply still a mechanism for individual complaints to be dealt with. Does this process also allow, for instance, for systemic complaints to be made&mdash;complaints that go beyond the complaints of individuals? If it does, how does it do it? That is the point that I am making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I understand that we are specifically dealing with amendments 1 and 2, amendment 2 actually refers to clause 96&hyphen;3 in the bill, which relates to the establishment of committees and which presumably could also at least provide for potential establishment of some broader based committee looking at broader issues. Amendment 3 contains a specific amendment to clause 96&hyphen;3, so the point is that you cannot actually discuss amendments 1 and 2 without reflecting or commenting upon what is contained in amendment 3.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand precisely what Senator Lees is saying, but we want to know where in these amendments and where in the legislation there will be any legislative basis for conducting the review and assessing the operation of the instrument, which has been identified by the Democrats and the government as being so crucial to their agreement, to getting the Democrats to now support this legislation. Only a matter of a couple of days ago, it was understood they probably still had major concerns. Where is it? We cannot see it. It is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5093"> not there. It should be there if it is so integral to the operation of this legislation as it is brought on stream over the next year or so.

With respect to your question, Senator Forshaw, as to a systemic complaint, yes, one is possible under this amendment. As for your other point as to where in this proposed legislation there is mention of the review, there is not.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I find it quite an interesting situation to have Senator Lees explain the position of the government on aged care. I am sure she does it very well, but I do not think I have experienced that in the past and maybe that is something that we will be seeing more of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some major concern about the failure of this legislation to really provide for a two&hyphen;year review and furthermore for a review of some sections of this bill within three months. I certainly understand the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Senator Ellison) that in his view an undertaking provided in this place has the same force
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as legislation, but I would suggest to him that in fact there are many decisions that say quite the contrary. I would like to ask him to explain, on the next occasion when he is on his feet, why, if these undertakings are of the same force and of the same effect, this government is not prepared to put them in a legislative form and amend the bill accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue that I wish to explore in some detail is this proposition that systemic complaints can be dealt with by this complaints committee rather than it just dealing with individual complaints about the application of the bill, the  regulations and the principles made pursuant to the proposed act. In my experience of the normal construction of complaints committees such as these, there is generally a limitation on such a committee looking at the experience of the complainant, seeing whether they have been dealt with properly in line with the legislation and its subordinate legislation, and then advising and making recommendations based on the existing legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary whether, by saying that systemic complaints can be dealt with, he is in fact saying that an elderly person who has been dealt with unfairly under this legislation can come along and say, `Because of the way this legislation operates, I only receive this sort of subsidy; I think that I should get more for it to be fair,' and that the complaints committee can recommend a change to the legislation and it will have effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Possibly the parliamentary secretary could outline in more detail exactly how these complaints committees are going to work. It has been indicated by Senator Lees that they will be set up in various states. Maybe the parliamentary secretary could confirm that. Maybe he could advise us when they will be set up, who will be appointed and what sorts of persons will be appointed. Who will have the power to appoint the members of the committees? Could the parliamentary secretary advise us whether either house of parliament will have some input into who is appointed?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5094">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once these complaints are made, what power and authority do these committees have to make decisions? What effect can they make to their decisions? Will they only be able to conciliate and discuss the problems with the complainant and the person against whom the complaint has been made or will they be able to make decisions which will then be implemented? If they can make decisions, how far can they go? Can they give directions to a nursing home? Can they make recommendations about amendments to the legislation? If they can make recommendations, will they have effect per se or must they be brought back to the minister? Must they be brought back to this house or both houses?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, with great respect, Senator Neal misquoted me. I did not say an undertaking provided in this place has the same force as legislation; I said it is `as good as'. That is a political comment that would, of course, have the political effect of opening  the government to attack if it were to renege on any undertaking or statement given in this chamber. I never said it had the same force as legislation, because, of course, that is silly and it is incorrect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the other questions that Senator Neal raised, I will deal with each in turn. Firstly, can a person complain that the legislation does not provide a certain benefit or bestow one upon them? Yes. Secondly, what happens if such a complaint is made&mdash;what power does the committee have? The committee can make a report and will report on a wide range of matters to the minister. It has no determination power at that stage, because if any changes are to be made to the legislation, that would be up to the parliament. Thirdly, yes, I can confirm that these committees in the respective states will be as outlined by Senator Lees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, as to who will be on these committees, I could not possibly give you any names; it would be entirely improper for me to do so. Fifthly, as to where these people
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will come from, they will be community representatives across the board. I touched on those in the second reading speech. Sixthly, as for any decision by the committee, your question was: what powers would the committee have in relation to determinations? Yes, it could direct a nursing home. As I said, the determinations would form part of a wide&hyphen;ranging report to the minister. I think that covers the questions.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to clarify that issue. You said that the committees would have the power to direct nursing homes. The usual provision in this sort of situation is that that power to direct can only be in accordance with the legislation and its subordinate legislation. I would like your indication if that is not the case. That would mean, of course, that a complainant could only come along and say, `Under the act and the principles I should have received this benefit. I am not receiving it.' The committee could then direct the nursing homes to provide that benefit in compliance with the legislation. But our fundamental concern&mdash;and our concern with this whole proposition of review and this complaints mechanism&mdash;is that if the complainant came along and said, `I am receiving the benefit that I am entitled to under the act, but I believe it is unfair and I should receive more,' it is my understanding that, in the usual course, the committee could not direct the nursing home to do something that was outside the legislation or in excess of what was required by the legislation, and in fact could not direct the government to provide a different subsidy to the nursing home than is provided for in the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You made a comment about the level of subsidy being a matter of government policy, and you rightly pointed out an issue that we wish to canvass later on: that there is nothing contained in this legislation that specifies a level of subsidy, and that that is something that the minister will deal with direct. Can these complaints committees examine the level of that subsidy and make a direction which is binding on the government as to a level of subsidy if a complaint is made to them by a resident or another interested party?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that in this situation you need to separate the two sorts of complaints&mdash;that is, one that pertains to the individual and one which is systemic. If one says to the committee, `Look, I think the level of subsidy granted by the government to this class of resident is inappropriate', that is a systemic complaint. But if the individual says, `I qualify for a category 2 or category 3 subsidy and I am not being assessed as such', that is one which pertains to the individual.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the latter case the committee could make a determination as to where that person could fall.

On behalf of the government, the parliamentary secretary said that there is no proposal for this most important issue to be enshrined in the legislation&mdash;that is, the fact that there will be a review in two years of the entire operation of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an undertaking from the government&mdash;I am not sure whether it is a core or a non&hyphen;core promise that has been made. Given the government's track record so far in adhering to promises I would be concerned if I was Senator Woodley that it may not come to pass down the track. I would have thought Senator Woodley would be wanting to ensure that, in the legislation, there was specific provision for that review and also for the three&hyphen;month review on the single instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all, if it is appropriate&mdash;and we acknowledge that it is&mdash;for the legislation to provide a complaints mechanism dealing essentially with individual complaints, and if
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5098"> it is appropriate to heed Senator Lees' concerns about the operation of a single instrument dealing with complaints from residents and providers within individual nursing homes, then, if it is deemed appropriate by the government to accept those concerns and to reflect them in the legislation by the amendments that are now before us&mdash;if that has been accepted by the government and, as we are told, insisted upon by the Democrats, which we support&mdash;why is it not appropriate that the legislation also make provision for these important areas of concern that you signed off on yesterday, namely, the two&hyphen;year review?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that the concerns with respect to the entire operation of the act and all of those issues which, as you know and I know, are still a matter of concern out there in the aged care sector would assume monumental importance. If we are going to have complaints procedures identified in the act and enforced, then it is not good enough, I would have thought, to just have the word of the parliamentary secretary on behalf of the government&mdash;as honourable a man as I know Senator Ellison is. As I said, is this a non-core or a core promise?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have just gone through a debate this week where the government made a solemn promise to have a convention on the head of state issue. They never told the public how they would establish that convention, what  would be the procedures for it, how the delegates would be elected and so on. They never gave any of that information out, but they said, `We'll have a convention to sit around and discuss this most important issue and have community involvement.' That is a review process of the constitution and of the issue. They brought the legislation into the Senate and, because the Senate did not like it and said it should be a compulsory vote, the government says, `Hang on, all bets are off. We may not even have the convention any more. Our promise does not hold good.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put to Senator Woodley and to the government that it is not a dissimilar position. As we understand it, what we have here is an offer, a proposal, a commitment by the government that the issue of aged care is an
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> extremely important issue. It is new legislation. It is important that it be considered and reviewed in two years, but we are not going to tell you anything about how we are going to do it. We are not going to put into the legislation how we are going to do it. So we are all opening ourselves up, obviously, for arguments down the track about whether or not it even takes place, how it will occur, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I am also concerned, Senator Woodley&mdash;you are also an honourable senator&mdash;that you have signed off on this agreement, knowing that all of those concerns are still out there. All you have is a verbal commitment from the government. There is nothing in writing that we have seen. There is nothing proposed by way of amendment to this legislation. I would have thought that was the very least you would have been demanding before you accepted this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

I would draw Senator Forshaw's attention to the work for the dole legislation, which you will remember the ALP gave an incredibly strong affirmation to. When it went to the other place and came back again, all of a sudden the core promise had evaporated. The Democrats did not change their vote. The Labor Party changed their vote.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public interest I wish to raise today is the implications for consumers if credit unions and building societies are permitted to compete with banks. The Wallis report into the Australian financial system, which was released in April this year, recommends sweeping reforms to financial regulation in Australia. Speaking at the Sydney Institute following the release of the report, chairman Stan Wallis said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Expressed simply, the Inquiry is about achieving competition in more areas of the financial system, more efficient outcomes and lower costs for users, whilst at the same time maintaining or improving the safety and stability of the system. These improvements can be brought about by a thorough modernisation of the regulatory framework.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Key recommendations designed to introduce greater competition and contestability involve opening up access to banking and other financial services to new entrants in the banking market such as credit unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wallis report asserts that greater competition in banking can best be fostered by bringing all deposit taking institutions, including credit unions, building societies, banks and insurance companies, under a single national prudential regulator&mdash;the Australian Prudential Regulation Commission, the APRC. The recommendations, if implemented, will have far&hyphen;reaching consequences for credit unions and consumers. Credit unions are now the sixth largest financial institution with more than 3.4 million members and $16.5 billion in assets, geographically spread throughout metropolitan, rural and regional centres in all Australian states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One in 10 adults use a credit union as their main financial institution. Not surprisingly
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5100"> many Australians, particularly those needing or perhaps comfortable with using credit unions, have become disenchanted with traditional banking services. Credit unions are distinctive in that, as mutual organisations, they are owned by and for their members and their customers are not subject to the usual pressures from shareholders. Each member is both a customer and a shareholder in their credit union and has a say in how credit unions are run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although credit unions have hit upon a style or service that their members obviously like, Credit Union Services, the peak industry body, asserts that complexities of the state based financial institutions scheme, which regulates the credit union industry, flows into the cost of regulation and hinders the capacity of credit unions to compete with banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wallis report found that Australia has the highest charges in the world for regulation of our financial system. It costs users in excess of $40 billion annually&mdash;an amount which by comparison exceeds the residential construction sector or indeed the entire retail sector. Wallis found that in 1995, banks accounted for the largest proportion of the total cost of the financial system at $22 billion, life companies and general insurance a further $7.3 billion, money market corporations and financial corporations $3.4 billion and building societies and credit unions about $1.4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When compared to other developed countries, 1996 OECD figures on bank profitability show the cost of the Australian banking system to be at the high end of the middle range. The report then estimates that $4 billion can be saved and costs permanently reduced by making banks compete and by making regulation more efficient. The potential for savings in the financial system is noted on page 3 of budget paper No. 1 where it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wallis Inquiry into the financial system made a large number of recommendations to improve the regulatory framework, and therefore the efficiency, of the financial system, noting that even a 10% improvement in efficiency in the financial sector would translate into cost savings for the economy in excess of $4 billion per year. The Government will consider these recommendations over
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the coming months, assessing how best to adapt the regulatory regime to the changes produced by globalisation, technology advances and consumer preferences.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If implemented it will mean that banks will no longer have special status and will have to compete with other financial institutions on a more level playing field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what are the obstacles currently inhibiting the ability of credit unions to compete? Credit Union Services claims that Australia has the highest charges in the world for regulation of our financial system and costs are passed on to the consumer. The most costly regulatory system is said to be the state based financial institutions scheme or FI scheme which regulates the credit union industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The financial institutions scheme inhibits the credit unions and building societies from effectively competing in the financial system by preventing credit unions from lending more than 10 per cent of their loan book to small business when they dearly would like to do so and by preventing credit unions from offering financial services to members in another state without first registering as a foreign society. Moreover, credit unions have been held up for over the past four years in efforts to seek approval to provide home loans similar to those innovative products offered by Aussie Home Loans and Rams.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is somewhat ironic, I think, that with these barriers to competition facing the credit unions it is easier for a foreign bank to compete for retail customers in Australia than it is for a credit union, owned by its members in one Australian state, to trade interstate. The former chairman of the financial institutions scheme's central institution AFIC, Professor Geoffrey Carmichael, was a member of the Wallis inquiry and is obviously in favour of the financial institutions scheme being replaced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recommending reform of the system so that all deposit taking institutions are regulated by the same megaregulator, the Wallis report has identified several underlying factors as driving the need for change in the financial system. I think they bear recalling.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5101">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are, firstly, the changing needs of and attitudes of customers. As the population ages there is an increased emphasis on savings and security for retirement. Increased consumer awareness has meant better access to information and ability to use new technology and a willingness to shop around for the best deal. Secondly, ongoing technological innovation has significantly reduced associated handling costs and data processing while software capable of being tailored to individual consumers' needs has reduced the need for staff at counters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, deregulation of the financial system and policy initiatives such as the development of compulsory superannuation, changes to taxation and privatisation have had enormous impacts on the financial sector. These factors and others have all led to a changing financial landscape and a regulatory framework no longer appropriate for this changing environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wallis recommendations have sought to promote competition amongst banks, credit unions and building societies, to reduce the cost to consumer of banking regulations, to ensure competitive neutrality between the various institutions offering deposit taking and other banking services, to encourage innovation and to promote uniform protection for all depositors. It is prudent to ask, as many depositors do, how safe are credit unions? How safe are your savings if deposited with a credit union?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Historically, the conservative loan policies of credit unions have ensured that they have not experienced the level of bad loans suffered by the banks. As Credit Union Services point out, over the last decade credit unions have had continued strong growth in assets. They have continued to have a high capital ratio comprised almost entirely of retained earnings which is high quality for prudential purposes, and the credit unions compare favourably with the safety and stability of banks. Predictably, there has been some criticism of the move to create a single prudential regulator and concern that that function should not be carried out by the Reserve Bank.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it is prudent to have concerns about the safety of customer savings, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Ian MacFarlane, has said that such concerns have little foundation and that, as the regulator will have complete coverage of all deposit takers, it will be in a position to monitor the soundness of those institutions. Since the Wallis report the new Labour government in the United Kingdom has announced a reorganisation of prudential supervision essentially along the same lines as the Wallis recommendations with the transfer of supervision from the Bank of England to an independent  regulator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Implementation of the Wallis recommendations are in accordance with world's best practice and, according to inquiry member Bill Beerworth, represent `a sensible evolutionary approach to prudential reform'. The government recognised the relevance of these recommendations to credit unions and building societies in the 1997-98 budget papers, where it is said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A central thrust of the report is to increase competition and efficiency in the financial system. This is likely to benefit all Australians, including those in regional areas . . . Of particular relevance is the proposal to put building societies and credit unions, many of which have strong regional associations, on a more equal standing vis-a-vis banks in terms of common regulatory and prudential framework.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It seems that the practical good sense of offering credit unions and building societies the opportunity to compete with banks has not gone unnoticed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course implementation of the reforms may be difficult and time consuming, involving the transfer of responsibility for non-bank institutions from the states to the Commonwealth. It will involve, no doubt, extensive negotiations to do with some constitutional limitations and the transfer of other responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The underlying rationale is increased competition and we cannot afford to have one of the recommended pathways to competition obstructed. Essentially, if it means that the reforms will promote efficiency, lower industry costs and increased benefits for consumers in an environment that is safe, we will need
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5102"> to find a way. I commend the recommendations of the Wallis inquiry in as much as it will affect credit unions and ultimately Australian consumers.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5102"><TITLE>National Crime Authority</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question the Senate has to address is: if Mr Elliott and Mr Scanlon are voluntary witnesses before the committee&mdash;who claim they have been treated unjustly by the NCA and who have commenced proceedings to claim damages of $200 million against the NCA&mdash;how can the joint committee do justice to the matter before it, namely the performance and motives of the NCA and its future,  without examining in an open forum all the documents that are related to the case against Elliott, Scanlon, Jarrett, Biggins and others?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why does the chairman of the committee shut down the investigation? The answer is simple. An examination of the transcripts and Jane Yuille's statement shows that: Mr John Elliott authorised the $39 million foreign exchange loss and that Mr Peter Scanlon's interview disclosed that, despite his claims to the contrary, he did initiate contact with Alan Hawkins and do the deal that resulted in Jarrett going to jail.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The NCA transcripts of the interview with Mr Elliott and Mr Scanlon are very damaging because they completely contradict the version of events that Mr Elliott has been peddling since the trial.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The NCA is currently investigating the sale of Elders convertible bonds to BHP and the names of the beneficiaries. Mr Elliott maintains he does not know who the beneficiaries were. He has, in fact, claimed they may be Belgian dentists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If he has nothing to hide, why is he resisting attempts by the NCA to establish who the beneficiaries are? Why has the NCA reduced the size of the investigative team covering the case to one staff member? Why is the chairman of the joint parliamentary committee, Mr Bradford, discouraging and limiting opportunities to question Mr Scanlon and Mr Elliott on these issues?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only way for this issue to be handled is for the Senate to agree to the tabling of the Jane Yuille statement,<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the NCA interview with John Elliott, the NCA prosecution case statement and the NCA interview with Mr Woods, the banker involved.

The statement, `Position: Nil' would appear to indicate this transaction has been closed out and finalised.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I recollect is that I had, again, a request from Brian Fitzgerald to meet with him at some time I believe in August 1988. He said he wanted to undertake a similar transaction as the one that was done earlier in the year,

<PARA STYLE="Para">Now we can move to an extract of the NCA interview with Mr Psaltis. On page 300, Psaltis:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The NCA prosecution statement reads as follows:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NCA prosecution case statement contradicts John Elliott's evidence before the NCA in relation to the second transaction with Hawkins. In his evidence John Elliott said that the $27 million loss had occurred and had to be paid by August 15 when in fact the transaction had not commenced until well after that date.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I now quote from the NCA prosecution case statement, paragraph 118:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . On or about 28th August 1988 Jarrett was in Hong Kong and advised Brian Wagar, the Chief Executive of Elders Finance Group in Asia that the payment was to be made through Hong Kong by back&hyphen;to&hyphen;back deals<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> with Elders.

<PARA STYLE="Para">There are a number of other things, but I would like to make a couple of points in my last couple of minutes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At no stage did John Elliott tell the NCA, in his evidence, that the transaction which he was authorising with Hawkins through Jarrett had anything to do with an options straddle, as they now claim. They claim that they told Jarrett to pay the so&hyphen;called options straddle and that it was an indemnity over BHP transactions. But they did not tell that to the NCA. They did not tell that to their auditors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that Scanlon, Elliott and Biggins are all on record that the money that went to Hawkins was over a &pound;120 million hedge against Courage sterling and their exposure. And that is their evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Scanlon says he has lost the paperwork on the options straddle. He wrote a note and he has lost the paperwork. I ask Fosters: it appears that at no stage did $66 million from this options straddle ever actually get across to New Zealand to Mr Hawkins that they say they owed him. So does Fosters still owe Alan Hawkins $66 million? According to the records that Mr Elliott, Mr Biggins and Mr Scanlon want you to believe, they must.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on a matter of great public importance. For some time now my office has been piecing together the details of the Telstra mobile phone study on mice and cancer, conducted in Adelaide. This is a very important study and it was my intention to draw it to the attention of the Senate&mdash;something, I must say, that neither the Minister for Telecommunications and the Arts (Senator Alston) nor the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) appears prepared to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, however, the task was made somewhat simpler for me by Mr Stewart Fist, a journalist whose work on telecommunications reportage for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> is both well known and respected. Mr Fist outlined very clearly the context in which the Telstra study was received by the industry and by the  federal government. I think it is important to have his article recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Mr Fist begins:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">IMAGINE that the Government has decided to prohibit the consumption of sugar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It allows three chemical companies (one owned by the Government) to offer a sugar substitute called glyco&hyphen;saccharine&hyphen;megagunk (GSM).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Imagine that, a few years later, the Government&hyphen;owned chemical factory finally caves in to pressure from health activists, and funds a test on GSM's safety, using 200 mice housed at Adelaide hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">After 18 months of feeding half the mice with a tablespoon of GSM a day (the other half getting normal sugar), the researchers find the GSM&hyphen;fed mice have a tumour rate 2.4 times that of the sugar&hyphen;eaters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Think of the consequences if no&hyphen;one released these results for two years; imagine if the chemical companies didn't fund another study to confirm the first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What would happen when the story broke?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I bet, for starters, that GSM would disappear from the supermarket shelves overnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I bet there would be an uproar in Parliament at the delay in reporting&mdash;and I'd hazard a guess that the jobs
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the ministers responsible would be on the line over the government's handling of the whole affair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a direct parallel to the Adelaide Hospital study, which showed that 18 months of exposure to standard GSM digital cell&hyphen;phone handset radiation more than doubled the tumour rate in transgenic mice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was not an isolated finding, as the industry propaganda would have you believe; it's just another (albeit vitally important) piece in a jigsaw puzzle which has been coming together for about 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now we are beginning to see the whole picture&mdash;and that picture is very disturbing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Communications Minister Richard Alston sees it differently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Senate on May 7 he said: "About the most one can say at this stage is that if there are mice in the community who are genetically predisposed to developing lymphoma, they would be well advised not to use mobile phones . . . That applies to rats as well, I should say."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Fist says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's nice to see the Liberals turning the clock back, but I hadn't realised they aimed to revive the great Australian cultural cringe.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I might say, too, that Senator Alston's intemperate remarks about Dr Neil Cherry in the Senate&mdash;Senators will remember his accusations about snake&hyphen;oil merchants and shameless charlatans&mdash;have similarly enjoyed wide coverage overseas. Mr Fist goes on:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to discuss the recommendations of the recent report on adult and community education of the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee. The report was titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Beyond Cinderella&mdash;towards a learning society</EMPHASIS> , and it follows on from the first landmark report of the committee in 1991, which was titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Come in Cinderella</EMPHASIS> . The explanation of the use of the name Cinderella is that, in many ways, the adult and community education sector, which includes over a million students in this country, is the poor cousin of education in terms of the resources provided to it. However, it is a dynamic, robust and very successful sector of education which deserves the encouragement of the Senate and the federal parliament. That is why I rise to speak about it today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attachment that I have to this sector first arose when I entered the Senate in 1991, when the first inquiry, which resulted in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Come in Cinderella</EMPHASIS>, was just starting. As someone who came from different sectors of education, that inquiry opened my eyes to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the great potential and possibilities of adult and community education in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the committee went to some very different places in Australia to see adult and community education in operation. We went to a place called Merredin, which is 300 kilometres east of Perth, out in the wheat belt of Western Australia. We were in a hall, with Hansard and all the operations of the Senate in place, speaking to this isolated community about its needs and the ways in which those needs could be fulfilled for the adults of that community. For example, we spoke to a Turkish lady who had been a qualified accountant in Turkey but could not get enough English language training under the system as it existed to become a practising accountant in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We discovered that the fourth sector of education&mdash;which adult and community education is sometimes called&mdash;is extremely diverse. It includes operations such as neighbourhood centres, where people who have had particular difficulties in formal education, people who often have failed in formal education, take their first tentative steps back into the education process. Those centres are often great vehicles for the disempowered in our society. They allow them to gain better educational qualifications and, therefore, to have a wider range of opportunities and life experiences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the diversity of the sector was reflected in places like the prison we visited near Darwin. The prisoners were mainly Aborigines, but they had the opportunity in the environment of that prison farm to undertake a number of courses and acquire skills which would help them gain employment when they got out. At another prison, a murderer appeared before us. He was in gaol for 15 years. He had already finished a bachelor's degree. When we spoke to him, he had just completed his master's degree in education and he was about to start his PhD on prison education. He had used his imprisonment time productively and in a way that would equip him to do well when he finally left prison.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5109">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A chef appeared before us who wanted funding to undertake courses such as Japanese cooking. Under the ANTA arrangements, that was not counted as vocational, but as recreational. However, as a cook, it was obviously going to increase his skills. Thus, various types of education are going on in this country. They are often short courses. They give people new skills. They empower people to improve their lot in life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second aspect of adult and community education is that there is a large group of people around the country doing it. One million people are involved in short courses, from basket weaving through to advanced short courses in computing. That is all part of this wonderfully diverse and extensive adult and community education system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other major features of this system are that it is very disorganised and often quite spontaneous. There is a saying in government `if it ain't broke, don't fix it', and when we first looked at this sector, we discovered a sector that was flourishing on very few resources. It was probably the most cost&hyphen;effective area in education. We wondered for a while whether, perhaps, we should touch it at all, because it was doing so well. But as I indicated, a lot of it is on a shoestring, and it does need some assistance. In terms of what we recommended in our first and second reports, we certainly started the Commonwealth off in a role in that area&mdash;and I will get back to discussing that in a minute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to focus on why it is so valuable and such good value for money for the Commonwealth to spend money on adult and community education. The particular aspect I want to focus on briefly is the work of groups like University of the Third Age, and I will just explain that concept briefly. The three ages, of course, are education, being in the work force, and&mdash;the third age&mdash;retirement, and those in this last group call themselves the University of the Third Age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not actually a university; it is spontaneous training in things that people who are retired are interested in so that they can lead a more fulfilling and active retirement. ACE has a very significant role in this group,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which is becoming a major group in the Australian community. It is estimated that by 2010 the proportion of people in our country over 65&mdash;which probably includes a lot of us here&mdash;will have changed dramatically. Increased longevity means that people can expect to enjoy, compared with earlier times, up to 20 more years of life. It is important that people in this time be given the opportunities to access services such as education which can make their time in retirement much more rewarding. Indeed, we can see a move across the country indicating that people in this category want to pursue a much more active retirement to optimise their quality of life, to avoid their dependence on others and to continue to contribute as active citizens in our society. Adult and community education often provides an ideal environment for these sorts of aspirations to be realised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the nation's obligations to respond to the legitimate needs of its citizens, financial considerations also require that governments look closely at how they can allocate funds across a wide range of services. With an ageing population, the cost to the public purse of retired people's dependency, whether in aged care facilities, hospitals or services related to the home, will continue to escalate. Every effort must be made by governments to investigate strategies which will alleviate dependencies and postpone the need for entry to nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Research is demonstrating that considerable savings are available if we encourage people to engage in activities such as the University of the Third Age. The direct health benefits are very apparent. It appears for example, that sustained mental stimulation delays the onset of dementia and similar medical conditions. The personal and social benefits of older people retaining active connections with the community are almost incalculable. The fourth sector, ACE, by its nature holds the key to transforming and empowering individuals in this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in 1991 the federal government, based on the report on adult and community education <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Come in Cinderella</EMPHASIS>, took its first tentative steps in this area by developing a national policy as recommended by the committee and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5110"> undertaking research, setting up an office, collecting data and implementing 11 out of the 33 recommendations of the report. We have been highly critical over the last few years that the other 22 recommendations were not implemented, but it was a start.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since that report came in there has been a change in the focus of effort in the training sector.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a national policy now but, unfortunately for this sector of adult and community education, in some ways its efforts have been somewhat deflected by the development of another national policy over that time, and that is in the training area which took form with the development of the Australian National Training Authority. The problem this created for adult and community education was that access to public money was often dependent upon the fact that that money should be spent where people were in training for particular job outcomes. Of course, under that sort of arrangement the bulk of the adult and community education work was not accredited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have taken a very hard look at those developments under the previous government up to 1996 and we have recommended a different direction so that adult and community education can get a fairer go. Quite often, even though the Australian National Training Authority does not classify the sort of education that is going on as having work outcomes, in reality it does. An example is the cook who undertook Japanese cooking. That increased his credentials and improved his employability, but that is not recognised under the guidelines of the Australian National Training Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we would like to do&mdash;and this is the main thrust of the recommendation in our report&mdash;is to bring the adult and community education sector alongside the training sector&mdash;not create any new national body but put them all under the one umbrella, the Australian National Training Authority, and expand its charter and role. That would help the groups that are in adult and community education to access more public funding than they were able to under the previous arrangement.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have suggested that the main requirement is that they be registered, particularly under state bodies. With that registration what can happen is that they can access funding under three different categories. Category A covers specific industry education and training; category B, non&hyphen;specific industry education and training; and category C, general education and training. This will then facilitate a wide range of programs that will be able to access this from what have previously been termed skilled and non&hyphen;skilled areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendations that were made to support this new approach were made across parties. We had coalition members, Labor members, Democrats and Independents all supporting this change in emphasis in the work of ANTA so that the million people who do adult and community education get a fairer chance. We feel that this change in emphasis will help create in Australia a learning society. Industry, education groups and professions under their related peak bodies will be able to move in a far more effective way towards the realisation of what they are trying to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The task of creating a learning society is probably one of Australia's most important challenges and this change in arrangements we believe will help facilitate that. The Senate committee does set out this challenge to the government but also we set out this challenge to other providers in education across Australia to change our system to help more people access education and training so that we can truly move towards a learning society.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5110"><TITLE>Salmon Imports</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on a very serious matter of concern about an action taken by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr John Anderson. It is my understanding that Minister Anderson has directed AQIS, the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, to conduct an import risk assessment on the importation of fresh, unprocessed salmon from New Zealand. I raise this concern because for some time now Australia has been dealing with another import risk assessment
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5111"> in relation to imported, unprocessed, fresh and frozen salmon from Canada and the United States. That matter is currently before the World Trade Organisation Disputes Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What causes me great concern&mdash;and I know causes great concern to the salmon industry in this country&mdash;is that, whilst we have that matter being dealt with at the World Trade Organisation level, this minister has proceeded to get AQIS to conduct a further risk import assessment into salmon from another country that are, in the main, affected by diseases that are the same or very similar to those that are currently before the World Trade Organisation in respect of Canada and the US.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apparently, about June last year, the minister wrote to his New Zealand counterpart advising him that once the Canadian and US matter was out of the way Australia would consider, as a priority, New Zealand's application to sell salmon into our market. Why has AQIS now commenced this import risk assessment? The four diseases that are of primary concern in New Zealand are already covered in the risk assessment that is before the WTO. There is no reason and, indeed, no justification&mdash;even based on what I understand the content of the minister's letter to his New Zealand counterpart to be&mdash;for proceeding now. But AQIS has, as I understand it, employed the staff to do this job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry has had to pay some $500,000 to put its case, to AQIS in the first instance because somehow AQIS has a view that there is no problem with the importation of fresh salmon products from other countries. In the first draft risk assessment AQIS recommended that the current restrictions be lifted. But it has had to do some backing down on that, which really should have been the case in the first instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter is of significant concern because one particular disease, that commonly known as whirling disease, has the capacity to wipe out major sections of the fresh trout populations of Australia, particularly rainbow trout. Whirling disease will be a concern to the five million recreational anglers in this country. If they had any idea of what this
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister, the government and AQIS, in particular, are proposing, I am sure that many more of them would be calling for the head of the minister and, I think, calling for a few heads in AQIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whirling disease is a common name for an affliction that infects certain fish via a microscopic parasite known as Myxobolus cerebralis. It has a two&hyphen;host life cycle, fish and worms. The parasite has a free&hyphen;swimming stage that enters young trout, attacking the cartilage. In severe infections, inflammation around the damaged cartilage places pressure on the nervous system, causing the fish to whirl&mdash;that is, they will swim around in little circles. In seriously affected fish it obviously reduces their ability to feed. It makes them more susceptible to predators and mortality is very high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The spores formed by the parasite whilst inside the fish are released upon death so that any infected fish when they die release the spores back into the water system. These spores are then ingested by a worm known as T. tubifex, which is prevalent and is found in Australian fresh water. So we do not have the disease but we have the host for it. That is why we have to be particularly careful when we are dealing with imported products that can be hosts for these diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The disease is found in the muscle of fish. It is not easily detected and, as I said, it is released upon death. As was presented to AQIS previously, if imported fresh salmon comes into this country and is then sold through supermarkets, people will buy it, as is currently the case. People have a tendency to use fish for fish bait or, if they have not eaten all the product, they dispose of it in the rubbish where it can be picked up by birds and then transferred into the water system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other reason why this particular disease is of such great concern is&mdash;and I highlight this fact&mdash;that most of the diseases of salmonids came from Europe and they have been transmitted around the world. Not so long ago, New Zealand did not have the disease which is now known as whirling disease. It is understood that it was transferred into the United States of America in the 1950s. In many cases, it has lain dormant
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5112"> over long periods of time, but more recently it has had a very severe effect on many of the trout fishing rivers in the US. Some of them are very famous rivers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Colorado, it is reported that population losses have been identified in the Colorado, Gunnison, Arkansas, Rio Grande, South Platte and Poudre rivers. In a 1994 study of the Gunnison Gorge section of the Gunnison River, state fisheries biologist, Barry Nehring, reported that 95 per cent of the newly hatched rainbow trout in that river disappeared some time between August and November. In the upper Colorado River, between summer 1994 and spring 1995, Nehring reported a loss of 98 per cent of the 1994 crop of young rainbows. That in itself is a very clear indication of the impact of this one disease, let alone the other three diseases that are found in New Zealand salmon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Montana, whirling disease was reported in 1994, when a fisheries biologist, Dick Vincent, reported the presence of the disease in the Madison River. The Madison River is a very famous trout fishing river. He reported that 91 per cent of the rainbow trout popula tion disappeared between 1991 and 1994. That is a drop in population from 3,300 fish per mile of river down to 300 fish per mile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact on tourism that that disease could have in this country, particularly for regions in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, in relation to recreational fishing would be devastating. It is not acceptable to even consider a further risk assessment with regard to the importation of salmon product from New Zealand when, only as recently as 1990, it was rejected on the basis of possible infections being brought in through the product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has changed? Nothing has changed except that Canada and the US joined to seek access and that access was ultimately refused&mdash;and rightly so, I should say&mdash;by the government. The case is now before the World Trade Organisation disputes tribunal. The four diseases that are prevalent in New Zealand are also diseases that will be debated and resolved, whether or not they have an impact in the WTO process.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no gain to be had, except that it will impose a cost on the industry that it does not need, because it is already fighting the same arguments in another process. The minister should bring an end to this. He should direct AQIS to cease the progress of this import risk assessment until such time as, as I understand he indicated to his New Zealand counterpart, the WTO process&mdash;the Canadian&hyphen;US process&mdash;has been brought to an end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would you want to duplicate the process? Aren't the arguments the same? As I understand it, AQIS is not going to report on the risk assessment for New Zealand until either late this year at best, or more likely in February&hyphen;March next year. So what is the point? Why does the government want to burden this industry, which is a very valuable industry and a very important one for Tasmania? Why do they want to burden it with huge costs again? They have already had to spend a half a million dollars defending their position&mdash;and they have rightly defended it so that they proved AQIS wrong in the first instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is the government proceeding down this line? Surely the minister ought to have the guts to stand up to AQIS. Either he runs AQIS or AQIS are running him. Right now, it seems that AQIS are running the minister. It is about time it was brought to a stop. AQIS may think that they have sufficient money to waste by employing additional people to do something that is already being done and that, at this point in time, is totally unnecessary. Or the minister thinks, `Let AQIS give the industry a box around the ears, because they proved AQIS wrong in the first instance, and burden them with further costs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know many government members and senators took a very strong stand with regard to the possible importation of Canadian&hyphen;US salmon. I would urge them to go to their minister and request that he stop any further progress on this import risk assessment because, as I said, it is a worthless exercise and of no use at this point in time. I will briefly refer to what the Canadians are report
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5113"> ed to have said&mdash;and this relates to their view about some of the diseases&mdash;in the revised draft of the salmon import risk analysis with respect to their application:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Canadian authorities have also pointed out that the causative agents of the diseases of concern to Australia are unlikely to be present in sufficient numbers in headed, eviscerated product derived from wild&hyphen;caught Pacific salmon to transmit exotic diseases to susceptible populations in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That has made the point about whirling disease alone. It is not just our salmon industry, because our salmon industry could actually deal with it from the point of view of treatment. It will not be a problem for them if we get whirling disease. The problem will be to the freshwater species of fish in this country and, in particular, to very important trout fisheries that, in the case of my home state, deliver significant tourism dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not stand by and see those things wiped out. It is totally unacceptable. I call on opposition senators and members to go to their minister and get him to stop this ridiculous process.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5113"><TITLE>Salmon Imports

Senator Murphy would not be in a position to make a contribution in respect of the World Trade Organisation were it not for the fact that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) and this government have already forcefully defended the Tasmanian salmon industry. I think that should be on the record: that this government has taken steps and that it is going to apply a strict and rigorous scientific approach to all of these things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know&mdash;I have discussed this matter with Minister Anderson myself, as have other honourable senators from the government side&mdash;that Minister Anderson takes the view that if the Canadians or others are going to

That is why we have go through the process of thorough investigations of each of these claims. But that is not the matter I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate today; that is merely in response to Senator Murphy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to draw the attention of the Senate to what proceeded last night in the Senate Environment, Recreation Communications and the Arts Committee hearing into Telstra. It was very obvious that contrary to Telstra's indications that they intended to deal with CoT case victims in a fair, open and honest way, in fact, they set up a dirty tricks department whose task was to basically frustrate any attempt by CoT case victims to get any information, or to bring their claims against Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The highlight of the hearing last night was evidence by a former Telstra employee, Mr Lindsay White, who was part of this dirty tricks department that was the customer response unit. He said that in the case of one particular CoT case victim, Mr Graham Schorer, there were 10 people assigned to his case for years, and they were given one instruction: Mr Schorer and others had to be stopped at all costs. That was the Telstra attitude. Mr White should know because he was part of that team of 10 people assigned to target Mr Schorer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the Telstra customer relations policy in action. The activities of this dirty tricks department call into question Telstra's commitment to resolving the complaints of CoT case members quickly and fairly. Worse still, they operated in such incredible secrecy. They kept secret files that were not made available to the customers, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, or the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. These things were kept secret for one reason alone: to frustrate these people, and to prevent them having an opportunity to actually find the information that Telstra had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At one point in the proceedings, Telstra tried to say to us, `We were happy to give over any document that somebody requested.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5114"> If they could specifically request a document, we would give it to them.' We said, `But did you tell them what documents you had?' They said, `No.' We asked, `Did you tell the Commonwealth Ombudsman or the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman?' They answered, `No.' I had to ask them, `How were these people supposed to get the documents? Were they supposed to have a seance to know what you had?' This is the conduct in which Telstra have been engaged for years. It is very obvious that they ran a dirty tricks department, the cost of which is well in excess of $14&half; million for the last couple of years. And that is without including the cost of FOIs or of legal advice provided by the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department to Telstra. Telstra's conduct has been absolutely reprehensible.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts asks why has the government seen fit to ignore certain concerns of Aboriginal peoples. I have to say that, in the limited time available, I have not been able to

In these circumstances, it is not feasible to hold consultations with parties other than the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not saying that concerns expressed by the Aboriginal community, or indeed particular groups of Aboriginal peoples, were not taken into account; I am simply saying I do not know what they were.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am asked why have we apparently ignored the principles of the law of the sea convention, and again there is an assertion that somehow we have determined boundaries on political rather than on other technical grounds. I am not aware that the government is alleged to have done that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of consideration of the logistical problems and increased expenses that will now have to be incurred by CSIRO, all I can say to that is that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade did consult widely within the government, but I will certainly check whether CSIRO was specifically consulted and whether it raised any specific concerns that might have affected the matters that have been addressed by Senator Margetts.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Alston), to a question without notice asked by Senator Faulkner today, relating to ministerial responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Today in question time we had a most extraordinary answer from a minister out of his depth. It has been a difficult week for Senator Alston, and I think we all acknowledge it. Today he has had to table a whole range of answers to questions which he had been unable to answer. He has been very disappointed, apparently, that the chamber has not taken due account of his new puffed&hyphen;up position. We have seen the self&hyphen;importance with which he comes into the chamber. It is his big chance, with Senator Hill overseas, to take the leadership of the coalition in the Senate. Sadly, Senator Alston blew it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say, no&hyphen;one in the opposition thought that he would blow it as badly today as he did in relation to the question asked of him about Mr Prosser when he compared the situation of Mr Prosser with the two senators who were forced to resign from this chamber&mdash;that is, Senator Short and Senator Gibson. I would like to remind the Senate of the situation in relation to Senator Short and Senator Gibson, as I mentioned in my question to Senator Alston today. On 15 October, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said this on Sydney radio:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both of them&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, Senator Gibson and Senator Short&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have been forced to leave the Ministry&mdash;or in the case of Brian Gibson, cease as a Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;not because of any misleading of Parliament intentionally, not because of any wrong doing, simply because they were in technical default of the rules because they breached the requirement that there must be no appearance of a conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to explain the situation in relation to Senator Gibson, which I touched on in my question. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the same way Brian Gibson is a shareholder with his wife&mdash;and it's their superannuation from his previous business activities&mdash;in the holding company of a company that he granted a futures exemption to. I mean, there's been no personal gain of any description. But they were technically in breach and in those circumstances&mdash;there was an apparent conflict of interest&mdash;they had to go.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When asked today about this situation, whether it was enough for those two senators to resign their high office because of an appear
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5131"> ance of a conflict of interest, do you know what Senator Alston said, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson? I will quote what he said today in question time. Book a time, Senator Alston, to come back in the chamber and explain yourself and dig yourself out of this hole. This is what he said, `Senator Gibson acknowledged, I think very graciously acknowledged, that there was a conflict.' That is what he said. He went on to say, `It does him great credit.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does that mean in relation to Mr Prosser and comparing his behaviour with that of Senator Gibson and Senator Short? What it means is this: the only implication any reasonable person can draw from that is that Mr Prosser should do the right thing too. Mr Prosser should do the right thing and resign. Oh, Senator Alston, what a job you have done today! Of course, I think that will be the implication that all Australians will draw from this. The difference between Mr Prosser's behaviour and Senator Gibson's and Senator Short's behaviour is apparently that Senator Gibson and Senator Short were willing. They were just more gracious.</PARA>

They did the right thing, and to their great credit they did the right thing. According to Senator Alston, so gracious were these two senators. Of course, the truth of the matter is this&mdash;and this is the nub of it: it was not even the fact that there was a conflict of interest; it was an appearance of a conflict of interest.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One thing that is very obvious is, whenever the other side sees somebody on our side of politics who is successful, they run on `the politics of envy'. That is how they consistently operate. The situation is very clear when it comes to this lot on the other side. Just have a look at their operation in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their time. They could not even have somebody who could run a sandwich shop and get it right. That is what we have over on the other side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a very simple point in terms of the proposition you put. You are assuming&mdash;you are the judge; you are the jury&mdash;that Mr Prosser is guilty. Mr Prosser is not guilty. That is the simple answer to the particular question before us. He is not guilty. What he has done is shown that people who leave school at 14 and go out in the real world can make some money and can be successful. They can employ people, set up businesses and be successful. You run this line because, if somebody is successful and you cannot deliver anybody yourself, you want to get them thrown out. You want to attack them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is&mdash;and it is confirmed very clearly by the letter from Mr Greiner, which has been tabled in the other place, and therefore I do not have to table it here&mdash;that there was no misleading. There was no misuse of his position. He makes one telephone conversation, but that does not make him guilty of anything whatsoever. That has been made absolutely and totally clear by Mr Prosser in the other place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at it a little bit more. What did you people do in terms of your principles? Even when Carmen Lawrence, who is in the other place, was found guilty by a royal commission, did she resign? No, she did not resign, did she? She was defended, and she was defended by you very people over there who are now making these claims before us at this point in time. Mr Prosser will live by his decision, and he will continue to be a very successful minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of Senator Faulkner attacking Senator Alston, it is absolutely and totally irrelevant to the question. In fact, Senator Alston has done a very good job, a successful job. He has stood in a very positive, strong way while Senator Hill has been absent from this place. You people should acknowledge that there is plenty of talent on this side of the chamber to handle these particular matters. That is what you have to acknowledge. It is about time you did start acknowledging that. Not only that, it comes up the tree. It is not
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5132"> like your side of politics. You do not even have one person who has made a success of anything over there, and you need to acknowledge that before you start these outrageous attacks on successful people like Mr Prosser.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is totally irrelevant and has nothing whatsoever to do with it. I want to deal with a few aspects of the question before us and the matters that you are criticising. The first point that needs to be put down in this place&mdash;it has also been put down in the other place&mdash;is that, when it comes to matters in which Mr Prosser has an interest, Mr Moore will handle those. That needs to be put on the public record in this place. That is absolutely clear and has been put down. You people need to acknowledge that. You are very good at screaming and yelling and shouting about these particular matters, because you cannot offer anything more constructive or anything more useful to the debate at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I say in the time that I have left that one of the things Senator Faulkner did acknowledge is that in our particular case, when there was an issue of this nature of substance, both Senator Short and Senator Gibson did do the right thing. This is not the same thing. Everyone on the other side of the chamber needs to understand that we are talking about two different things. Mr Prosser is not guilty of any offence. He has done the right thing in relation to this matter. He will continue to serve small business in this country extremely well. That is acknowledged in a statement that I have before me from none other than the Australian Small Business Association. Mr Siekmann, the director and spokesperson of ASBA, said that Mr Prosser had shown no bias in his dealings with any matters related to the Reid report. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

The evidence from Nick Greiner is that there was no further discussion about any substance and that is borne out by the letter that he wrote to the parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Mr Prosser did was hand over the running of his business to his brother. He also employed a manager. What do you expect someone to do when they come into parliament?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister Moore will be looking at the response to the report in question. There is nothing wrong with that.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5133"> He is in charge of industry&mdash;an allied area of the portfolio to small business. Any perception is easily overcome in that way. There is no perception at all in relation to this event which the opposition is trying to hang its hat on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is trying to grasp a column of smoke because that is exactly what it is dealing with. There is nothing there. This phone call which they are relying on and which is corroborated by Nick Greiner was nothing more than a phone call for a contact. Mr Prosser stated his business interests very clearly for the record. He has declared them to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). The process is totally transparent. I can say that the people of Australia have been sadly misled by the opposition when it maintains that this is a minister who is not fit to hold office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia are lucky to have a man like Geoff Prosser, a man who came up as an apprentice and at the age of 14 was running his own shop and at 16 was running a business. That is the sort of the person that Australia should admire. This man came up without formal qualifications. He is a self&hyphen;made man. He has promoted employment in the area of Bunbury. I have seen it first hand. He employs many people now and has contributed to employment in the past. Are we saying that this person is unfit to hold the office of minister? Of course not because the fact is that there is no perceived conflict. To satisfy any of those on the other side who are crying foul, Minister Moore can quite adequately deal with the matter and refer to the response to this report that is being dealt with. That deals with it fair and square.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So on all three counts the opposition fails to bring a case that needs to be answered. In this case, you have a situation where a minister has acted properly and with transpar ency. There has been no question of him continuing to run his own business. He is at arms length from the business and his brother and the manager concerned have been running it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can say to the people of Australia that they can rest assured that they have a man in Geoff Prosser who is well capable of handling
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this portfolio. He understands both sides of the fence. He has been on both sides. He is a self&hyphen;made man who had to lease premises himself. He then became an owner of premises. Most importantly, he is regarded as a fair landlord by his tenants and they have said so on the record. What more can you get than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is the sort of person we need to be looking at this area of small business. He is the man who brought in the small business deregulation report. He is the man who instigated the most comprehensive review of deregulation in the small business area. That has been responded to by the business community. In my portfolio, I have responsibility for the response to deregulation in the food industry. That is something that was an initiative of Geoff Prosser. He is to be commended for it. History will look back on him and say that he was a great Australian.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Faulkner's motion. Mr Prosser is clearly in breach of the guidelines that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) imposed on all ministers. Prior to the last elections, one of the proudest boosts that the Prime Minister made was that he was going to clean up politics in Australia and he was going to do so by imposing guidelines of ministerial conduct and probity on his own ministers that he would expect them to live up to. Those guidelines set the hurdle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue in this debate is: did Mr Prosser breach them? As soon as Mr Prosser's hand snuck out across his desk to lift the phone from the cradle to ring Nick Greiner to ask for an advantage for his private company in Bunbury he breached those guidelines. The defence that the government has put up is that he only asked Mr Greiner who his brother should speak to. Just take those words. He asked Mr Greiner, a director of Coles Myer, who his brother should speak to in order to get a Target store in Mr Prosser's Eaton property development. That was directly in the interests of advancing his company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not need to go any further than that and you cannot have a defence that Mr Prosser does not daily oversee the affairs of his company. Various citizens of Bunbury are
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5134"> pleased to say on television that they see Mr Prosser around his shopping centre acting as a cleaner on weekends in his spare time. You do not have to go to that detail. The fact that he was asking a director of Coles Myer who his brother should, in the interests of the advancement of his company, speak to in that organisation was an act to advantage his organisation that he privately owned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue here is a clear and open issue. Should a minister of the crown that has a public responsibility to all citizens of Australia use that office for private gain? Should he use a public office for private gain? Out of Mr Prosser's own mouth we have the words that, yes, he did seek to advantage his own private property holdings. For whose gain? For his brother's gain and for his gain. Let us not have this duplicitous argument that he did not breach the guidelines. He breached those guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He breached those guidelines in another way as well. Ministers and members of parliament rightly&mdash;and this is something for which the Labor Party has always argued&mdash;are to declare their pecuniary interests and put them on the public record so all Australians can see what private advantage members of parliament might have when they conduct themselves on public affairs in this nation. If they conduct themselves as to advantage their private interests then they have a conflict of interest and should stand down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does Mr Prosser put on the declaration of pecuniary interests? In terms of his own pecuniary interests, he has listed a number of his own companies. That is true. But when it comes to property holdings he has listed on his pecuniary interests: `Bunbury&mdash;various lots.' Does that tell any Australian who comes along to inspect the pecuniary interest register what lots he holds, how many, what value, their strategic location, and  what development he wishes to carry on on those lots? Of course it does not. His entry on the pecuniary interest register is meant to obscure, not to enlighten, his holdings so Australians do not know the extent of his pecuniary interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that ground alone he is in breach of one of Mr Howard's guidelines. But there are two
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> grounds for his dismissal. The fact that he did and has confessed to misusing public office for private gain is a reason why he should be dismissed. The fact that he obscured the details of his pecuniary interests is a reason for him to be dismissed. There is no other argument about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only argument that is left is: why hasn't the Prime Minister acted? Why does he allow one law for Jim Short and one law for the parliamentary secretary, Brian Gibson, who were forced to resign, and another law for Mr Prosser? What is the reason for this weakness or this duplicity? Simply, the Prime Minister is running scared and his government is looking shaky when more and more of his ministers get caught in the trap that Mr Howard set when he set those guidelines of ministerial conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you do not want your ministers to observe those guidelines, do not proclaim them. When you proclaim them and they break them, sack them. If you do not sack them, you are weak. If you do not sack them, you are not only weak but also complicit in supporting those transgressions. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

Therefore, the Labor Party, the Labor government, had no standards whatsoever.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator MURPHY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just go back to the ministerial code of conduct that was introduced by the Prime Minister in April of 1996. In particular, I refer to page 11 of that document where the first dot point says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. The transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I now want to go to a speech that the Prime Minister made to the Business Council of Australia in March of 1996. It really relates to why the Prime Minister made such ado about the introduction of the ministerial code of conduct. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the reasons why the respect for our institutions has declined is the way in which promises are too freely made and even more freely repudiated after governments are elected to power. I think part of the process of restoring trust and confidence in the process, the political process, is for governments to try to the best of their ability, and even beyond that if that's possible, to meet the commitments that they have made. And I have indicated to my colleagues and I have indicated publicly and I will go on indicating it publicly that nobody should
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5137"> imagine that I will lightly accept any repudiation of the commitments that we made to the people.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They did make a commitment with regard to parliamentary standards. They said that they were too low, and they claim, and the Prime Minister has gone on publicly claiming, that that was the very reason for the introduction of this ministerial code of conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me come to the very point of what the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) has done. He has acted in his own self-interest in respect of his own company. He made a phone call to the former Premier of New South Wales, Mr Greiner, to ask him, as a director of Coles&hyphen;Myer, whom he should contact&mdash;whom his brother should contact&mdash;to act in the interests of a company he owns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us see what the Prime Minister said in respect of former Senator Short when he had to resign from his office. The Prime Minister said on 10 October 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me make a couple of very direct points about Senator Short. Let me say at the outset of making those observations that at no stage has Senator Short sought to hide from the Australian public, or hide from anybody, the ownership of those ANZ Bank shares. At no stage, in my view, has Senator Short behaved dishonestly. At no stage, in my view, has Senator Short taken a decision which has been influenced or conditioned by his ownership of those shares.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on further to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Was he in breach of the guidelines? The answer is clearly that he was.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What is the difference between the action of Senator Short and that of Minister Prosser? None whatsoever. The ministerial code of conduct clearly says, and I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What is the case for Minister Prosser? Exactly that. That is why we have raised the questions. He has no right to use his position of high office to influence outcomes within his business, to provide a benefit to his business. He has no right to do that and there are very legitimate reasons why we should raise those claims. I can go further with what the Prime Minister said about Senator Short. This is really where the Prime Minister has hung
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> himself and nailed his intentions to the mast. He says very clearly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Senator Short had at no stage made a decision that was influenced by the ownership of those shares&mdash;and that is the critical test of morality in this, that is the hard core test  of morality here; you may not like it but you have to face that fact&mdash;to have asked for his resignation? If Senator Short had taken such a decision, I believe Senator Short's resignation would have automatically followed. But the fact is that he had not done so. Having been satisfied that his personal honesty in the matter was not in question, I took the decision, given the fact that it was in his early months as a member of the ministry . . .</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Sun Fund is an $85 million per annum plan that would enable farmers and others who receive the diesel fuel rebate for electricity generation to opt instead for an upfront grant towards the cost of installing renewable energy systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This positive, creative and practical scheme has benefits all round&mdash;for farmers, miners and others who can get a grant towards the cost of installing renewable energy systems, for jobs and investment in the renewable energy industry which would get a massive boost, and for the environment with a direct reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, the Sun Fund is revenue neutral for the government since it uses money that would otherwise be paid as diesel fuel rebate and, over time, positive because diesel generation will be permanently replaced by renewable sources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People who are eligible for the diesel fuel rebate can opt to apply instead for a grant from the Sun Fund to install photovoltaic, wind or solar thermal systems. The grant is up to ten times the amount they would otherwise receive in a year as diesel fuel rebate for electricity generation&mdash;about $7 500 for a farmer running a system to supply a moderate&hyphen;sized home and machinery. Over a ten year period, a farmer converting to photovoltaics would be $5 000 better off than staying with diesel and, in a site that is economic for wind power, the farmer would be $18 000 better off.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The potential market from replacement of diesel electricity generation by renewables is 600 MW. This is no small potential&mdash;600 MW is half the output supplied by Tasmania's 39 hydro&hyphen;electric dams. And compared with the current installed capacity of photovoltaics and wind in Australia, 600 MW represents a massive 40&hyphen;fold expansion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These industries are already export&hyphen;oriented, and poised to benefit from the stimulus that the Sun Fund would provide. They export about half their product at present. A recent study by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy shows that the global market for solar cells is growing, with the largest demand from Asia, and that Australia has about 9 per cent of world production (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Renewable Energy Industry</EMPHASIS> ,<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Survey on Present and Future Contribution to the Australian Economy, </EMPHASIS> DPIE, May 1997).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Climate Change Convention Conference of Parties in Kyoto in December draws near, there will be immense pressure on Australia to show that it is genuinely tackling greenhouse gas emissions, especially if the government persists in its irresponsible special pleading for exemption from mandatory targets. Having abolished funding for
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5147"> renewable energy research and development, halved the energy efficiency program, taken no action to bring new vehicle fuel efficiency into line with US and European standards, or to implement other `no regrets' measures, Australia's stance is cynical and hypocritical. </PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I note the change in the chair. Senator Reynolds from Queensland, who has a particular interest in the sugar industry, is now presiding in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last three points of this motion are immediately important to the Senate. Let me go directly to them. The fourth point is the fact that, despite all the things that we said above in this amendment, the government has decided to abolish the sugar tariff effective from 1 July. In some six days time, the tariff in the sugar industry will be abolished. The fifth point is the fact that the abolition of the tariff will mean job losses and a loss of $27 million for Australian sugar growers, a significant blow against the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly and lastly, the sixth point is the fact that the government has no plans, does not intend and is not going to bring this measure before the parliament for debate before it comes into effect on 1 July this year. It is therefore for the opposition to bring the future of the sugar industry in Queensland before the parliament. The government, in taking this action to unilaterally remove tariff protection for the industry, will not. On that ground, and on that ground alone, this government should be condemned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In this debate that has now been raging around Australia for some time, the shadow minister for industry and regional development, Mr Crean, has been the leading figure. I now want to go to what Mr Crean said in summarising the position for the opposition. In a feature article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> in April this year, under the heading `Australia's future is in industry', Mr Crean said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1993 Labor froze the sugar tariff and kept the single desk for exporting. This newspaper&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He is referring to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> &mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">condemned the move at the time, as did the Industry Commission, predicting that it would impose significant cost and restrict the industry's growth. Yet this month it applauded the growth of the sector over the past decade, pointing to the fall in protection, and concluding that this made the  Howard Government's decision to scrap sugar tariffs "the correct call".
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5150"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is the significant part:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It failed to recognise that more than half the industry's growth took place in the last three years, the period in which the tariff rates were frozen. In the case of exports, almost two&hyphen;thirds of the increase took place in this period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1993, reducing tariffs was not the central issue. Opening up production was. Labor used the tariff as a bargaining chip with producers and the Queensland Government to free up land use and ensure expansion of the industry. Not only is Labor's present policy on the sugar industry consistent with our past approach, it is a policy that worked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of our international obligations, Labor remains committed to the APEC timetable for free trade. Having invested so heavily in achieving the agreement, it would be lunacy to scrap it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But this is not just a timetable for us. We are already well ahead of the pack in meeting our obligations. We're simply saying that the others have to do some catching up. We want them to be with us at the finishing line in 2010 and 2020.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the sugar industry, for example, our Uruguay Round obligation is for a 5% tariff by 2000, not a zero tariff by 1997. The US maintains a 100 per cent tariff. Thailand 104 per cent and the EU 170 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That summarises the case that I and other opposition speakers will put in this debate today. This matter is urgent, as I have said, because in six days time the government will remove existing levels of protection after holding a gun at the head of the industry, forcing them into a situation where some in the industry have announced their support and many in the industry have announced their opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are six grounds upon which I propose this motion. Ground 1 is that it breaks a solemn election promise made by the government to this industry in the 1996 election. Ground 2 is that the industry was forced, by the government holding a gun at their heads, into a position where some agree. Ground 3 is that it is a sell&hyphen;out by various of the politicians in the sugar seats in Queensland and New South Wales who, rather than represent the interests of their constituencies, are in fact supporting the government against the interests of their own voters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ground 4 is that there is considerable financial loss to the industry by the measure that the government proposes to peremptorily
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enact. Ground 5 is that it represents an inconsistency in treatment between various industry sectors. Witness the government's position on the car industry, the announced position by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) on the textiles, clothing and footwear industry and the reverse approach being taken in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ground 6 is that we give up, by going down this route, a major bargaining chip which would enable Australia to negotiate a reduction in tariff levels in countries to which we target our exports. By unilaterally disarming ourselves, by dropping our own levels of tariff protection, in international trade negotiation we are unable to trade our levels for reduction in levels in the international market, which would enable our efficiently produced sugar to win a greater world market share and thus more jobs for Australians and more growth for this industry sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the six reasons that I put forward in support of this motion. On ground 1, the election promise, what did the government say in the 1996 election? Those words are best traced to the National Party's deputy leader and now Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Anderson. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal and National parties recognise the industry's tariff protection has been significantly reduced over the years to its current level of $55 a tonne as Australia has set the trend by moving protection downwards in advance of international competition. A Liberal and National Party government will not reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level of $55 a tonne, as we have already met our obligations under the World Trade Organisation's GATT `94 agreement.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also say on ground 2 that the industry has had a gun held at its head. This

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Canegrowers chairman, Mr Henry Bonanno said, `Cane growers have reluctantly accepted the tariffs' demise as part of a compromise&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">this was a compromise arising from a threat by government ministers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to retain the industry's single desk selling arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Ballantyne of the Canegrowers Association said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS>  program:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If either side of government could have guaranteed our industry that the retention of the tariff would have also guaranteed retention of our other marketing and structural arrangements, then we would have probably had a different approach.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They were blackmailed into this course of action and are complaining about it. A gun was held at their heads. There was an outcome that the government seems to think is a fair deal. It is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many federal politicians who have deserted their electorates in this case. These are sugar seats located in Cairns, Lucinda, Townsville, Ayr and Mackay. Warren Entsch, Peter Lindsay, Paul Marek, Paul Neville, Warren Truss, Ian Causley and Larry Anthony have continued to vote in the House to export jobs from this industry, desert the people in their electorates and promote their own political interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The financial loss for this industry is $27 million. That is not just jobs that will be lost eventually; that is also a loss of investment and development in this industry. It is damaging to families, it is damaging to the rural communities that support this industry, it is gratuitous damage being inflicted by the government on this industry. It is, as I have said, inconsistent with the treatment in the motor vehicle sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot go to the detail of my six points that I would like to, but I conclude by saying this. Around the world there are various levels of protection. The United States has a 100 per cent tariff on sugar. In Thailand it is 104 per cent. In Europe you have to cross a barrier of 170 per cent to 193 per cent for tariffs. In Australia we have 13 per cent. We are going to unilaterally give away that 13 per cent. We are not going to say to the Europeans or the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Americans, `You drop your levels and we'll drop ours.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might seem strange that I am taking an opposing position after three years of fighting for this industry tooth and nail. But let me just correct Senator Cook's one assumption. He said it was a government decision. I can tell you, Madam Acting Deputy President, and you would know, and so would Senator Cook and Senator Woodley: if the government held a gun at the sugar industry's head, I would be the first one screaming loudest and longest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a sugar main report, which comes up with 74 recommendations. In the report there were people who represented the industry: Harry Bonanno, whom I continually talk to on a weekly basis, representing the canegrowers body; a gentleman called Ron Verri, of the Australian Canefarmers Association; Graham Davies, Chairman of the Australian Sugar Milling Council, representing sugar mills in New South Wales and Queensland; Mr Gentile, of the Sugar Users Group, and state and federal government representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a unanimous report that was brought down. I am arguing about the tariffs and the levels of protection around the world, because I believe Senator Cook has probably got it out of my speeches. I have fought for that for a number of years. But the argument we are going to at the moment is not a tariff argument; it is an argument about whether an industry has the right to be in charge of its own destiny. If an industry says it has signed off and shaken hands on a report, then has that industry got the right to maintain its own interest? I say that it has. I may disagree with what the industry says, but I will support the industry's right to have a say in its own future. What this industry has done is produce a report with all the sugar users, and they have come down and said, `Well, there are 74  recommendations; we want a unanimous
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5152"> decision' and therefore they support the recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook made the point that there was a gun held at the industry's head. I have continually asked the industry: were you in any way forced to come down with this recommendation? And I have been told, `No'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This argument falls to the ground because an industry must have the right to elect its own leaders. Ninety&hyphen;five per cent of the sugar grown in Australia is grown in Queensland. It has one of the best leaderships of any rural industry that I know. That industry elected its leaders and the leaders considered the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sugar winning globally</EMPHASIS> report. That report was not set up by the National Party or the Liberal Party; it was set up by your government. When you were in government&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You set it up, yes. There is an admission. You were the ones who brought in the Hilmer reforms&mdash;those whacko Hilmer reforms. You were the ones who brought those in. You were the ones who put up the report and the industry responded to your report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's just put a few things on record. In May 1988, the Labor government abolished the embargo and tried to replace it with a tariff of 35 per cent. That was completely rejected by the industry. Who moved for the Senate inquiry that came up with a tariff that was accepted by the industry? None other than yours truly. I was the one who moved for the Senate inquiry which came up with an acceptable form of tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further down the track, that tariff was $115 a tonne. Who wanted to remove the $115 a tonne? The Labor Party did, although it had said that it would last for a number of years. Who crossed the floor to support the industry? Ron Boswell and the National Party, Senator Harradine and the Democrats. So no&hyphen;one can say that I have never supported this industry. This industry has always had my support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a tariff argument. If an industry signs a document and says that the tariff should go, and that is part of an overall 74&hyphen;
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">point plan that we want, then I am in no position to argue with that industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report that came down was not the result of a small inquiry. It was the most comprehensive review that has ever been made in the sugar industry and it involved all sectors of the industry. It took in submissions from all sugar growing areas in Queensland and New South Wales and it covered all the encompassing areas of tariffs, marketing arrangements, cane supply, processing, ownership and management of bulk sugar terminals, Queensland sugar industry production and marketing arrangements, research and development, and the extension of arrangements. All these things were part of the report. And only one part of that report was the removal of the tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry recommendation was that with the introduction of export parity pricing&mdash;this was one of the 74 recommendations&mdash;the tariff becomes irrelevant anyway. The working party's first recommendation was that the Queensland sugar industry be provided with a degree of planning certainty and that there be no further reviews for a period of 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This review cost the sugar industry&mdash;that you set up, Senator Collins, and you admitted it&mdash;about $3 million, not including the cost of the labour involved. All they want is to get away from being reviewed and continually reviewed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and who fought for that restructuring package?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This industry is a great industry. It has grown by about 60 per cent in the last five years. Export sales are $1.6 billion a year. The industry in Queensland will export 90 per cent of its crop in another year's time. So the tariff would apply only to 10 per cent of the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5153"> crop because 90 per cent would be exported.  The New South Wales growers, which represent about five to six per cent of the industry, have never put a tariff on their sugar. They have traded away the tariff arrangements to get into what they thought was the more lucrative domestic market, which became not so lucrative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other part of this report&mdash;which will be a great benefit to the industry&mdash;is that the quid pro quo on this is an amalgamation between CSR and Mackay Sugar, which the refining industry is bleeding to death.</PARA>

It was the Democrats, in fact, that took the lead on this issue, because I was approached months ago by Bob Katter and De-Anne Kelly&mdash;two faithful National Party people from Queensland. I immediately began to take action to restore the sugar tariff. Labor finally noticed that the tariff had been cut, so they have come on board, and I am happy about that.

Mr Ballantyne&mdash;he has been quoted regularly here&mdash;has made it quite clear to me and others that they want this report, and its 70-odd recommendations, adopted in totality. They do not want anything changed, interfered with or altered. They have made that very, very clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another important issue in the recommendations&mdash;that is, the recommended switch from import parity pricing to export parity pricing. Senator Collins knows, as everyone else here should know, that switching from import parity pricing to export parity pricing, by definition, means that you cannot apply a tariff to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was in Queensland last week and I spoke to representatives from the Australian Sugar Milling Council and others, including Mr Ballantyne. They made it clear that the cost of the decision to develop the industry, which has been implemented by the current government in Queensland&mdash;who to their credit have adopted all the recommendations as they apply to them; only two or three apply to the federal government&mdash;is $US26 a tonne. We were given that figure in Queensland. Once again, that was a decision of the working party review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very, very important to acknowledge the people involved in this review: Harry Bonanno, the Chairman of Canegrowers, has already been mentioned; Mr Ron Verri, the then President of the Australian Cane Farmers Association; Mr Graham Davies from the Australian Sugar Milling Council; Mr Tony Gentile from the Australasian Softdrink Association, whom, incidentally, I am seeing tomorrow; and Mr Alan Newton from DPIE. Are you telling us that Senator Collins would not have accepted the advice from Mr Newton? If you are, you are misleading this house. He was the resident expert in DPIE working through these issues. There was also Mr Robert Reilly from the Queensland DPI.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5157">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must touch on some of these things. As I have already mentioned, it was the Labor Party who set up this review. To the credit of these people on this review, they went out and told the industry, `Let's deal with this in  the context of national competition policy. Let's do it now because if we don't, we'll be back here in 18 months doing this report all over again.' That was the position they adopted. They went out and explained that to the canegrowers. I have been up there and talked to them as an independent person. They made it quite clear that they wanted these things put in place because they believed that it would put them in the best possible position for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was their decision to keep the single desk, not anybody else's. All this nonsense about guns being held at their heads! Some of the people who are saying this ought to talk to the people up there. I asked them to give me evidence, letters, anything at all, to show that a gun had been pointed at anybody's head. They could not produce one concrete word. The populist mob over on that side invent these things because it makes it seem as though they have a good story. In fact, the people who were involved in it made it absolutely clear that there was no pressure put on them at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They made the decision to deal with this report in the context of national competition policy. That is why they moved from import parity pricing to export parity pricing. You can argue whether that was necessary or not, but that is not the point. The point is that it was the decision of the working party to do that, and they came up with that conclusion. That is worth noting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a fundamental weakness in the terms of reference that were put together for this review. That is why we now have the ministerial task force initiated by the coalition government. The Democrats and the Labor Party need to acknowledge they admitted that there were two things that needed to be looked at. One was the allocation of the US quota, which is a national quota, as Senator Collins would know. The other thing they omitted to look at was the operation of the bulk terminals as the industry continues to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> grow and, within that process, they fundamentally omitted to look at the export potential and growth in New South Wales. Incidentally, New South Wales last year exported some 30,000 tonnes of sugar and the Ord production from W.A. was, in addition, all exported, and the Queensland Sugar Corporation handled it for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that this issue is dealt with on the facts, not on emotions. As Senator Boswell said, $3 million went into that review out of their pockets, not including their own time. If we were to come into this place and say, `We are going to ignore the recommendations that were put forward,' you would attack us for not listening to the industry. You cannot have it both ways. It is as simple as that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After looking at this report and the advice that I have received on it, it is my view that this will take the sugar industry into the 20th century. It will allow them to continue as a major exporter in this country. I believe currently&mdash;Senator O'Chee would know&mdash;that sugar is the fourth or fifth largest rural export from this country in dollar terms. They are significant. They are important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, the Ord River is going to grow. We were given information that in the future&mdash;I am talking about 10 or 15 years&mdash;we could expect 500,000 or more tonnes to come out of the Ord River. In addition, the Fitzroy could yield another 500,000 to one million when developed. We were given information that the New South Wales industry is going to grow significantly. That all has to go on to the export market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last point I deal with has to do with the refining sugar industry and the joint venture that was stopped from going ahead because it was anti&hyphen;competitive. The result is that now we have a serious mess in the refining industry in this country. Once again, we are left to clean up the mess. On the final analysis, we have before us what is a very thorough, very well&hyphen;thought&hyphen;out and very well&hyphen;presented report. We have been given a very succinct message that they do not want us to fiddle with it. People have to listen to that message because it is important. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion highlights what can only be described as an incredibly foolish and economically destructive trade policy. Unilateral and unprovoked tariff reduction can only be described as leading with our chin. A fat lot of good it will do the sugar industry or  any other industry that must compete on unfair terms!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bob Collins said that he never did believe in unilateral tariff removal. That is interesting, but honourable senators may remember the many questions I asked around 1993 and 1994. They included issues about the footwear, clothing and textile industries and about the impact and the level of destruction that it was having on those industries. The previous government's response at the time was, `We didn't have to do this. We were doing it voluntarily.' If there were people in the Labor Party at that time who did not believe in unilateral tariff removal, I was not hearing from them. They were not there during the debate on the World Trade Organisation in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Deregulation of investment will further damage and degrade the industry, allowing overseas investors connected to food interests to gain dominance in the wholesale and distribution sectors to which the Australian sugar industry sells. There is more than one way to gain market dominance, and transnational corporations know it. There is also more than one way to gain market dominance. For instance, in the pastoral industry, affecting the actual incomes of pastoralists, many people were used as the front people in relation to why we should go down the free trade ideological road. Those people&mdash;primary producers&mdash;were used. They were pushed to the front in order to argue that, and they are often the ones who are suffering. Also our value added industry is suffering, but it was the primary industries who were used as the excuse for everybody else having difficulties forced upon them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government wants to reassert their profile as tough deregulators. After deciding, very sensibly, not to gut our automotive industry by cutting tariffs, we saw a hue and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cry from many commentators in the media, collective in the sense that, for all the vast numbers of magazines, radio stations and newspapers, there are not necessarily a lot of opinions. But they generally agree with the agenda of deregulation, an absolute freedom for transnationals to do what they like, when and how they like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many economic commentators who have embraced the economic rationalist agenda have slammed the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in saying that the reform process has stalled. I do not use the word `reform' generally, because it means change for the better, and that does not necessarily coincide with what I see happening. Here we have a chance to recoup the praise of the media. The National Party, particularly the Queensland branch of that party, is sewn up&mdash;silenced&mdash;and will probably vote in favour of tariff reduction if told to do so. The only time the Nationals get to make a sound here is when they are attacking land rights or migration or frothing at the mouth over the Sydney mardi gras. When the rural community needs defending, the Nationals often hope the Greens will put something up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the motion is put by the ALP is of note. Senator Evans indicated that, through the Labor Party, I did get a couple more minutes on this, and I do not intend to use all of them to criticise the Labor Party. There will be some bouquets as well as brickbats here. The policy of unilateral forward tariff reduction is one they followed consistently while in government. I am glad to see that they seem to have had a miraculous conversion on trade, and I hope the government will have one. I do welcome Labor's re&hyphen;invention on the issue of trade policy. Let us take it further and discuss the whole issue like I have been asking for for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The failure to even consider the damage unilateral tariff reductions would do is appalling. It goes well beyond the failure to have a trade policy, an industry policy and an investment policy that would actually advance Australian interests. This is an urgent issue and one that warrants attention.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5159">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will not surprise honourable senators that I will continue to say that it is time&mdash;well overdue&mdash;for us to look at the impacts of our trade and investment policy. Let us look at textiles, clothing and footwear. Let us look at cars. Let us look at the sugar industry. Let us look at impacts on the environment, impacts of investment monopolies and consumer outcomes. Let us have a look in full at what  is happening in relation to our trade policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sugar is the fourth largest export earner. The average export earings for the last three years were in the range of $1.5 billion; 85 per cent and soon to be 90 per cent of our sugar production is exported. That is why all sensible thinking farmers say, `If we have to rely on a tariff of 10 per cent then we will give the industry away completely.' They understand what this is all about, unfortunately, unlike Senator Cook from Western Australia, Senator Collins&mdash;old Bluff and Bluster Bob&mdash;from the Northern Territory and Senator Hogg, who just demonstrated, with respect, in his speech that he has no understanding of the complexities of the sugar industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review was set up, as has been mentioned by my colleagues, by a federal Labor government and a Labor government in Queensland in September 1995. The objective was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To facilitate the sustainable development of an internationally competitive export oriented industry which benefits both the industry's participants and the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Time is short and I have agreed to curtail my speech to allow Senator Harradine to have a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> say in this, but I want to briefly refer to some of the aspects of the urgency motion put down by Senator Cook.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He says that the coalition has reneged on a promise. I want to tell you, Madam Acting Deputy President, and Senator Collins, who was big about promises, that the promise we gave to the sugar industry before the last election, which was exactly the same as the promise the then Labor government gave, was that we would not interfere with the outcome, results and recommendations of this sugar industry review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Harry Bonnano and Ian Ballantyne came to us before the last election. They spoke to John Howard and got a commitment from him as leader of the Liberal Party and opposition leader. They got a commitment from Tim Fischer, the National Party leader, and deputy opposition leader. They got a commitment from John Anderson, the Deputy Leader of the National Party and the shadow primary industries minister. That commitment was that we would comply with their request, which was that we would not alter the review recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know, because they came to Canberra specifically to get that, that they got the same commitment from the Labor Party. That is the promise we gave and that is what we have delivered. There are 74 recommendations. The Queensland government, a Liberal&hyphen;National Party government, adopted those 74 recommendations in December 1996. They have asked us to do that and we will be doing it as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook obviously does not know what our commitment was. He should; it was in all the papers. But he should at least know the commitment that the Labor Party gave to the sugar industry, which was exactly the same&mdash;and contrary to what they are trying to do now&mdash;and that is that all 74 recommendations would be accepted without variation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook blames us for implementing this tariff reduction from 1 July. We are doing that because that is what the sugar industry review working party recommended and we said we would accept those recommendations. That is what the canegrowers
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5161"> have asked for, that is what the sugar industry has asked for and that is what we are doing. Senator Cook's motion also goes on to talk about loss of jobs and loss of money for the Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know what the sugar industry is like. I have worked with it all my life. I understand the difficulties they have but I also understand that it is a very successful industry. It is an  industry that has expanded enormously, particularly in the Burdekin area where I live. If it is going downwards as the Labor Party are trying to suggest then why are people, as recently as a month ago, paying almost double the reserve price for Queensland government land being auctioned in the Burdekin River irrigation area? They are paying double the upset price&mdash;over $1 million for a block of land&mdash;because they want to get into the industry because it is so well done. They know that the tariffs are going and they are still falling over each other to get into it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sugar industry produces jobs and wealth for Australia. It is a tremendous industry, and it will continue to be so under a Liberal and National party government. All of the sugar seats are held by Liberal Party members or National Party members. Those people obviously know that it is this government which will deliver to them the sorts of reforms, the sorts of good things that will enable that industry to continue and get better and better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very proud to be part of a government that is so supportive of the industry&mdash;a government that is doing exactly what the industry has asked it to do. Senator Collins read from a particular letter, and Senator Hogg mentioned it. I might just finish, to allow Senator Harradine to speak, by just repeating one paragraph from Mr Ballantyne's recent letter. Unfortunately, I cannot do it. Very briefly, it is the third paragraph on page 2 of his letter of 19 June which I will table.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Saul was not satisfied that the Auditor-General investigated the matters that were the subject of his allegations adequately, and faxed to me in November 1996 a substantial number of documents. I referred a brief analysis of the contents of the documents to the Auditor-General on 25 November 1996 and stated in writing that I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the minute and related issues with him, in private, as soon as possible after he had had the opportunity to consider my minute and enclosures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor-General replied that "the long established and well accepted practice throughout the Office" was that the Auditor-General did not "discuss particular audits with anyone who has no responsibility for those audits." I understand the Auditor-General was referring to a brief review of travel allowance and overtime irregularities carried out by Price Waterhouse in February 1994 and followed up by the ANAO in September 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since that time, Mr Saul has faxed to me additional documents which have only strengthened my conclusion that there is substance in his allegations. Having given long and careful consideration to my duty and responsibility as a public sector auditor, I am of the view that it would be in the public interest if the document attached was tabled in the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you agree with my conclusion, it would be appreciated if you would seek leave to table this letter and enclosure in the Senate at the first opportunity. The Senate may then decide what action, if any should be taken with respect to the matters contained therein.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The great Telstra travel fraud</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(and Cover-up)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">24 June 1997</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Summary</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. In early 1992, the Federal Government appointed a former AT&amp;T employee, Mr Frank Blount, CEO of Telecom with a brief to clean-up the company and make it more efficient in the lead-up to increased competition. Almost immediately Mr Blount faced his first challenge&mdash;to change Telecom's decades old policy on travel allowances and eliminate major corporate fraud that had cost users of Telecom services billions of dollars over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Under the policy, employees away from home for weeks at a time claimed and were paid 14 days travel allowance while retaining accommodation for only 7 of those days. While only part of this payment was an allowable deduction, none of it was shown on Group Certificates, with the result that take home wages were boosted by amounts that often exceeded the wage. The very substantial increase in disposable income encouraged rorts on a major scale and an increase in travel that was avoidable. The policy outcome was a massive increase in the cost of labour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. In early 1992, hard evidence of the rorts was brought to the attention of the CEO. Operation Echo was established to investigate evidence of travel allowance rorts, and the NSW Police were involved. Almost immediately investigations were narrowed to one State; one category of staff within that State; and for the most part, the period of time prior to 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. In mid-1993 Telstra's CEO acknowledged that Telstra had a major problem. The NSW police sought the establishment of a joint AFP/NSW Police Task Force, but when the AFP refused to become involved, the investigations collapsed. The final outcome of Operation Echo was a single conviction, with a gaol sentence reduced on appeal to a good behaviour bond.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. Notwithstanding the failure of Operation Echo, one of the original informants persisted with his allegations and maintained a constant stream of correspondence with Federal politicians, Telstra, the ATO, the Australian National Audit Office and other relevant government agencies. Eventually, forced by the weight of overwhelming evidence that it had been, and was in breach of the law, Telstra issued on 30 September 1996, "Guidelines to managers and employees on the tax implications of travel allowance" and introduced a Tax Certification form to accompany each TA claim.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. Deduction of tax instalments with respect to part of each TA claim commenced on 18 November 1996, where applicable, ie where an employee stated he had returned home from his temporary station during the relevant period, otherwise than as prescribed in Telstra's Human Resource Guidelines.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5164"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. In early February 1997 Telstra proposed changes to its travel policy that should have been regarded as fair, but which staffing associations labelled outrageous and unacceptable. At a hearing before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, Telstra's representative conceded that Telstra's proposed new policy was "a major variation from what is the current practice," and the representative of the Unions declared twice that "the option of  status quo is one that we would certainly like to exercise." He indicated it was "a potentially explosive issue" and it would be unwise in the extreme to give any commitments on whether the matter would lead to industrial action. Discussions with the ATO and with Telstra would continue, he said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. In the absence of industrial action, it appears that an accommodation was reached between Telstra and the Unions, but at what price? The Union position was that "any taxation on TA should be paid by the management." Telstra did not state its position, but soon after the AIRC hearing announced a $3 billion return of capital to the govemment. It continues to meet claims for 14 days TA per fortnight and treats the payment as wholly deductible provided an employee declares he did not return home during the relevant period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. As no receipts, or details of accommodation at the temporary station are required for audit purposes by Telstra, the company has in effect made it easy for employees unwilling to relinquish the benefits of the custom and practice of the past 30 years, to maintain the status quo. The only significant difference between current and past practice is that employees alone are now responsible for false declarations, and the ATO alone is responsible for detection of such declarations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10. Telstra's CEO and Board have known about this scam since 1992. They have had the time and the opportunity to change the policy and reduce the cost of labour so that cable roll-out commitments could be met and Telstra would be in good shape for the imminent share issue. Instead, they have done nothing but deceive their Minister, their appointed auditors and the owners of their stock&mdash;the Australian taxpayers. The result of their refusal to address the TA issue is that high labour costs were maintained and Telstra failed to meet its cable roll-out commitment to Foxtel. This will cost Telstra directly at least $400 million in compensation to News Corp and/or Foxtel and further major losses will be incurred when Telstra's stock is issued at a significantly lower price than would have been the case if Telstra had acted responsibly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11. Telstra not only failed to act responsibly, it failed in its duty of care to its shareholders. So the real losers are the taxpayers and to an extent, the thousands of employees who will be sacked when Telstra reaches its roll-out target&mdash;cable past 4 million households, or 2.5 million households if it is assumed that Telstra's CEO accepts directives from the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12. The winners will be the purchasers of Telstra shares who can almost certainly expect to see a hefty increase
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the price of their stock when Telstra finally delivers on its promise of reducing excessive labour costs. It remains to be seen whether executives responsible for the mess Telstra is in are accountable for their performance and whether our elected representatives, who are supposed to be in control, are willing to act to prevent further loss to the present owners of Telstra.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra's former travel policy&mdash;in brief</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Until recently, Telstra employees were entitled to TA on the daily rate during the first 21 days of a temporary transfer to a particular location, if they would be away from home for 12 hours or more, and the travel time between the temporary location and the home base equalled or exceeded one and a half hours (8 hours of work + a lunch break of 1 hour + a total of 3 hours of travel daily = 12 hours) and expense was incurred in retaining temporary accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The entitlement to travel allowance started from the time employees left their nominated home address (in or out of the State) to the time they arrived back at the same nominated address.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The daily rate travelling allowance in the following locations was: Sydney&mdash;$168.10; Brisbane&mdash;$165.10; Darwin&mdash;$159.10; Perth&mdash;$156.10; Melbourne&mdash;$155.10; Canberra&mdash;$137.10; Adelaide&mdash;$133.10 and country centres&mdash;$ 104.00 inclusive of meals and incidentals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. After 21 days, Telstra employees were supposedly on review, ie they were required to provide receipts for accommodation retained during their time away from their nominated home address (in practice, 7 days in each fortnight) and get paid according to the amount claimed for accommodation (in some cases limited to the daily rate allowance), plus meals and incidentals (up to $50.30  daily in capital cities and $47.25 daily in the country). According to Telstra's Human Resource Administrative Guidelines:

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra seeks assistance from Mr Saul</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. On 1 February 1992, Mr Frank Blount became Chief Executive Officer of Telecom. Later that month, Mr Ed Saul, a Telecom Communications Officer, received a telephone call while on long service leave, from Mr John Beston, a Telecom Protective Services (TPS) officer. Apparently a witness who had given evidence during Operation Saddler (a 1990 investigation of travel allowance rorts that resulted in 50 prosecutions) had mentioned Mr Saul's name and Mr Beston wanted to know what Mr Saul knew of travel allowance abuses, or any other irregularity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. The call was followed by a letter dated 26 February 1992 from Mr Tom Robinson, "to request your involvement in a matter of mutual concern." The letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Since taking on the job of General Manager, NSW North, I have been made aware of serious allegations concerning Travel Allowance abuse within NC(N) [Network Construction (North)]. I regard such abuse as fraud and have taken steps to eliminate potential corruption through introduction of changed approval and allocation arrangements. As you are aware, however, allegations continue both inside the organisation and through the media I am determined to stamp out this fraud. To assist me in this task I invite you to meet with myself, my Regional Operations Manager and the Regional Human Resources Manager to discuss your knowledge of such matters within NC(N). You have my assurance of complete confidentiality. . . . If you are willing please discuss details with my Human Resources Manager, George Williams, who I have asked to personally deliver this letter."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. According to Mr Saul, Mr Williams delivered the letter to his home in Crescent Head, NSW with the advice, "if you wish to keep on living, keep the zip on the lip."

Four employees of the external network construction branch of Telecom, the men who string the lines in country areas, have already been charged and appeared in local court on counts of imposition.

The strategy was in essence that no-one should make any admissions and, lawyers should be involved in any dispute that may arise, from beginning to end.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I am aware of two events, also somewhat after the fact, which may have reassured Telstra that no specific action was necessary:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In May 1994, the Australian National Audit Office conducted a brief review of the specific Marr outcomes, in the context of its review of travel allowance fraud issues, broadly restating the AFP's findings (but without reviewing the analysis: ch 4);</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In March 1995, Telstra received the management review it commissioned from Holding Redlich, which provided general suggestions for minimising the risk of overtime abuse (but similarly not reviewing any analysis nor indicating whether any specific internal response had ever been necessary: section 4.7).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Since that time, however, the more general internal audits to which Telstra refers have suggested that the scenario you describe could have been taken as a snapshot of some systemic difficulties. In April 1994, Telstra's audit of its Remuneration and Accounting Processing System raised the issue of `lack of policy and procedures and standardisation of documentation' in relation to overtime control. A major national review in November 1995, has since found:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a lack of standard overtime procedures at the corporate level;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"virtually nonexistent" communication of procedures from the corporate level to sub-Business Units;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Telstra's general actions since August 1993, therefore, would appear to confirm the context which enabled the specific DFS overtime abuse to occur.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. Mr Marr believed there was and lodged a complaint against the investigating members. His complaint resulted in an AFP Internal Investigations review of the inquiry conducted by the original investigating officers. The AFP officer who conducted that review stated:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"In my view, notwithstanding that the Australian Federal Police made a reasonable decision there was insufficient evidence to warrant prosecution, there were irregularities in the claiming and authorisation of overtime in the Development Forecasting Section in 1989-90 which amounted to a `rort' or system of minor fraud. . . .</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As mentioned in point 1 Telstra provides employees with travelling allowance for weekends etc on the basis that temporary accommodation is retained and the employee travels home at their own expense.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. What effect will the Australian Taxation Office Rulings have on our employee's travelling allowance payments?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) regard the flat rate travelling allowance rate paid to our employees as being "reasonable" (given they are also part of the public service and would therefore be aware of the basis which these rates are set) therefore, the payment is not required to be revealed on group certificates or income tax to be deducted provided the employee is absent overnight and costs are actually incurred.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) where accommodation is not retained at the temporary location the amounts of travelling allowance received between the time arriving at home or at another location until the time departing for the temporary station over the weekend would be regarded as income and would therefore be taxable.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As an example, if an employee arrived home from their temporary country location on Friday night at 6 pm and departed after an RDO for their temporary location at 6 am the following Tuesday, the taxable component of their travelling allowance claim would be $104 x 3.5 days = $364.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amount would then be added to the employees income for the fortnight and taxed at the marginal rate applicable to that fortnight's income.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, however, ER Service Operations have been instructed to impose tax on the allowance payable, at the appropriate marginal rate for the entire claim period, for those claims that are not accompanied by a completed and signed form.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MS K. HALFPENNY---Yes, sir. I appear for Telstra, with Ms L. DRAPER, MR C. DOHERTY and MR R DEANE-BUTCHER.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MR N. BRETAG---I appear once again, with MR C. COOPER</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE COMMISSIONER---Right, who would like to lead off? The applicant in this matter was Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MS HALFPENNY---Thank you, sir. Since our last appearance before you on 20 December, I would like to now update you on events since that date. Discussions with Telstra senior management took place on 20 January, and unfortunately due to the holiday period we were unable to get all the relevant people together until that date. That meeting included the chief executive officer of Telstra and group managing directors, which highlights the importance with which Telstra considers this matter. The outcome of that meeting was that two options were placed before the unions on the meeting scheduled with them on Wednesday 29 January.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These options are known as options B and C, and at that meeting unfortunately there was not much discussion, but the CEPU did ask us whether this was our formal position, ie whether the two&mdash;these two options were the ones that we want to discuss with them as a review of the travel policy. I informed the CEPU that the next day, on Thursday 30 January, I was meeting the senior line management within Telstra, and also the group managing director of employee relations, to discuss the two options with them, and decide whether a) this was our formal position without variation, and b) whether there was a preferred option.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I said that I would get back to the union by Friday 31 January with the outcome of that meeting. As it transpired, one option is preferred by Telstra senior management, option C, notwithstanding this does not negate option B being considered either now or in the future. I would like to hand up the correspondence that we sent to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5186"> the union, both the CEPU and copied in the CPSU, on Friday 31 January in relation to that matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EXHIBIT TELSTRA 1- CORRESPONDENCE FROM CEPU to CPSU, DATED 31.1.97</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MS HALFPENNY---As you can see there, sir, getting past the two pages which are the record of the faxes when it was sent, the letter is addressed to Colin Cooper, and it does refer to the meeting that took place on Wednesday 29 January, and also the meeting on 30 January, indicating to Mr Cooper that option C is based on the principle that Telstra should only be paying travelling allowance where travel costs are actually incurred, thus avoiding any tax impost, which as you would be aware is a major variation from what is the current practice.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also explained to the union that we would be sending out a communication to our employees, updating them on this preferred option, and this was consequently sent out on Monday 3 February. If I could perhaps hand that up as an exhibit also. In Telstra sir, we have two major ways of communication. One is what we call a fax stream, which goes to thousands of fax outposts within the company, and the other is what we call e-coms, which goes to the top 3000 employees in the company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EXHIBIT TELSTRA 2&mdash;DOCUMENT MARKED URGENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EXHIBIT 3&mdash;DOCUMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MS HALFPENNY---Both the CEPU and the CPSU were sent a copy of this communication on Tuesday 4 February&mdash;yesterday. That sir, is the sequence of events up until this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE COMMISSIONER---Okay, thank you, Ms Halfpenny. Yes, Mr Bretag</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MR BRETAG&mdash;Commissioner, as Ms Halfpenny has indicated, Telstra has now provided the union with an options paper. Whether or not those options meet the Commissioner's requirements outlined in your recommendation arising from the last hearing&mdash;whether or not those options meet those requirements is open to debate. Certainly we would say that your recommendation concerning those options being not limited has not been met, and we would point to the lack of a proposal concerning the status quo as being quite obviously a deficit as far as the union is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the union does not believe that any positive outcome would result from having that particular debate in this Commission today, and accordingly will not pursue this line of debate at this time. However, the CEPU does reserve its rights in respect of submissions that may be made by CEPU in this Commission, and potentially other forums, in the event that the parties are unable to resolve this matter through discussion. Commissioner, Ms Halfpenny referred to a meeting between the parties in which three options, which are options A, B and C, as they have become known, were discussed with the union.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to those options, Ms Halfpenny also referred to a document which referred&mdash;sorry, compared the Telstra arrangements with arrangements in other industries, and also referred to a study that had been performed by a company, I think it was Ernst and Young, or was it Price Waterhouse, I cannot&mdash;Price Waterhouse, I am advised. Now, the CEPU did ask at that meeting about certain information regarding the, for want of a better term, the terms of reference of that study be provided to the union, and at this stage that has not been done and we would certainly like Telstra to provide us with information at some early time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the CEPU believes that given the complexity of the issue, the need to determine an outcome based on the real work force requirements, and given the short time that has elapsed since the document was provided to CEPU, and the significant industrial relations history both within and without this Commission regarding this matter, that this matter would best be progressed through discussions between the parties, and that is what we intend to do, Commissioner. If the Commission pleases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE COMMISSIONER---So, do I take from that that understanding what has been put out in the documents and what has been presented to the CEPU, I think the documents from Telstra do acknowledge that their preferred option is C, but that does not exclude any discussions around option B. I also read into that that there should not be any exclusion of any other option that may be identified, for instance, by the CEPU, or in fact as the discussions occur there maybe some other option that might be identified by Telstra, but whilst those discussions are taking place, there will be no industrial action?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MR BRETAG---Commissioner, we would not exclude any options in the discussions between the parties. Certainly I have indicated the option of status quo is one that we would certainly like to exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE COMMISSIONER---Sure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MR BRETAG---In regard to your question regarding industrial action, Commissioner, I am not able at this stage to give any commitments to this Commission regarding whether or not industrial action may take place on this issue. As I have indicated in my submissions these are very early days. This is an industrially explosive issue, and it would be unwise in the extreme for me at this early juncture to give you any commitments in that regard. Certainly I can take your comments and what I read to be the intent behind your comments back to my organisation, but I certainly can give no commitments in that regard to this Commission today</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE COMMISSIONER---All right, well then you would understand Mr Bretag, that understanding the position you are in, that if the Commission is made aware that there is likely to be, or there is in place industrial action, it would convene a hearing as a matter of some urgency?
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5187"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MR BRETAG---I would expect that that would occur, Commissioner, yes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE COMMISSIONER---Yes, okay. I just do not want you to get a fax and wonder why you got it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MR BRETAG---No, I do not think that will happen, thank you.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE COMMISSIONER---Yes. Ms Halfpenny, is there any more that that you wish to add?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MS HALFPENNY---No, sir, thank you.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE COMMISSIONER---All right. You understand, of course, that what I have said to Mr Bretag would be dependent on Telstra to advise the Commission if there was any impending or likely industrial action?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston, and the Minister for Finance, John Fahey announced today that-after consultation with the Board of Telstra and following the advice of the Government's sale advisers-it has been agreed that Telstra will make a payment from retained earnings to the Commonwealth of $3 billion by the end of this financial year. Telstra will raise new debt in association with this initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This payment will ensure Telstra's capital structure is more in line with other international telecommunications companies. Telstra's current debt to equity ratio is widely recognised by market analysts, and by Telstra itself, to be low by international standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of the return of capital is to put in place the optimal capital structure for Telstra prior to the sale of one third of its equity. Other initiatives are also being considered to optimally position Telstra ahead of the public share offer.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The payment means Government's borrowings will not increase to the extent that they might otherwise have.</PARA>

This will allow Telstra to reflect its new capital structure in its balance sheet as at 30 June, which at this stage is expected to be the balance date for financial statements included in the privatisation offer document.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I table the document. This document inadvertently was not tabled at the public meeting of the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee which occurred last night. It is a summation of matters which I first raised in the parliament as long ago as 1992. It relates to allegations of massive travel allowance abuse and fraud in Telstra which, it alleges, has been going on under the nose of Telstra management. It is my understanding that this document was prepared by Mr David Bertleson at the request of Mr Edward Saul from Port Macquarie, New South Wales, and it incorporates much of the evidence which has been amassed by Mr Saul over a number of years. Mr Saul, in fact, speaks with some knowledge of these matters, having at one time been employed by Telstra's protective services unit to assist in investigating overtime abuse. This is a sorry tale of mismanagement by Telstra and, I believe, victimisation of some of those who have sought to bring these matters to some sort of an end. I am sure that many honour

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of Senator O'Chee, I seek leave to make a statement on behalf of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee on a revision of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Federal Executive Council Handbook</EMPHASIS>  in respect of explanatory statements for delegated legislation, and to incorporate the statement in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has initiated or expanded many personal and parliamentary safeguards in respect of delegated legislation. Not least of these is the acceptance that every disallowable legislative instrument must be accompanied by an Explanatory Statement to assist Senators and Members and those whose rights are affected. The Federal Executive Council Handbook recognises the interests of the committee in this regard, advising that explanatory statements are mandatory for regulations and are prepared
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for circulation to Senators and Members and to the committee. This is not to say that all explanatory statements are of acceptable quality. In fact every year the committee writes to ministers about defects in explanatory statements. In such cases, however, the minister has always provided the committee with additional information which has enabled the committee to complete its scrutiny of the instrument. Recently, however, the committee has had a difference of view with the responsible minister about two aspects of what matters should properly be included in explanatory statements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On behalf of the committee I am pleased to report that these differences have now been resolved to the committee's satisfaction, with the Secretary of the Federal Executive Council advising that a circular, which will serve as a revision of the Handbook, will be sent to all departments and agencies, advising of the committee's requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have already reported in detail to the Senate, on 12 November 1996, on action by the committee in respect of the first of these differences with the minister, but I was not able at that time to report a satisfactory outcome. I will now briefly outline the concerns and the earlier activities of the committee before reporting on our finalisation of this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Crimes Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1996 No 7, exempted the Australian Securities Commission from some of the privacy safeguards of the spent convictions scheme. The committee ascertained that the relevant provisions of the enabling Act provided for the involvement of the Privacy Commissioner in such exemptions. The Explanatory Statement, however, did not advise whether the Privacy Commissioner was consulted before the Regulations were made or, if so, of the result of any such consultations. The committee wrote to the minister about these matters. The minister replied three and a half months later, advising that the Privacy Commissioner was consulted and had recommended that the ASC not be granted an exemption, but that the Privacy Commissioner's recommendation was rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee wrote again to the minister advising that it was concerned that the Explanatory Statement for the Regulations did not advise that their provisions were contrary to an express recommendation of the Privacy Commissioner in respect of an application which was referred to him under a statutory duty. The committee advised that, in the circumstances, it would be appropriate to repeal and remake the Regulations, with a proper Explanatory Statement. This would preserve the options of the Senate in respect of disallowance but would not disrupt the existing arrangements pending informed parliamentary scrutiny. The committee also advised the minister that it would obtain the views of the Privacy Commissioner on the Regulations and would then decide whether it would be helpful for officers of the department to meet with the committee.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5189"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Privacy Commissioner subsequently advised the committee that he was not aware that the Explanatory Statement omitted to refer to his views and that he appreciated the continued support of the committee in seeking to promote a more open approach by agencies in relation to differences of view with his office, especially where legislation is concerned. The committee therefore asked the minister if officers of the department could attend its next meeting. The minister wrote back to the committee, advising that officers would attend, but also advising that, while the committee correctly required departments to provide explanatory statements, the present Explanatory Statement was adequate. The minister advised that it was not appropriate to include matters relating to the internal working of government in a document having such a wide circulation as the Explanatory Statement. The minister was prepared to adopt a future practice under which the views of the Privacy Commissioner were communicated to the committee at the same time as Regulations were tabled, but he could not agree that the failure to included those views in the Explanatory Statement was a procedural defect. A member of the minister's staff also wrote to the committee advising that the minister was aware of, and regretted, the delay in replying to the committee's original letter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee subsequently met with officers of the department. At the meeting the five Members present expressed emphatically their view that explanatory statements should include advice of any mandatory consultation before the instrument was made and of the result of that consultation. The committee then wrote to the minister suggesting that in the present case the failure to do so was a breach of parliamentary propriety. The committee noted that present Commonwealth drafting practice appeared to be to include sometimes lengthy recitals in the making words for instruments that statutory consultation requirements have been met. The committee gave 11 instances in one year where this had occurred, including one instrument which referred to consultation with the Privacy Commissioner. The committee advised that it supported this practice and assumed that if the relevant consultations or advice led to results which were unusual or unexpected, such as a decision to reject a recommendation of the Privacy Commissioner, that this would be explained in the Explanatory Statement. Finally, the committee advised that it would write to the minister responsible for the Federal Executive Council Handbook, asking for the Handbook to be amended to require explanatory material to advise of any mandatory consultation. The committee did this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three months later the minister advised the committee that, in light of the committee's views on the matter, he now agreed that the information about any mandatory consultation should be included in the Explanatory Statement and that he would instruct officers of his Department to adopt that practice in future. The committee is grateful for this helpful cooperation from the Attorney&hyphen;General, the Hon Daryl Williams AM QC MP.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second area of concern by the committee about the contents of explanatory statements related to acknowledgment of the role of the committee in the making of particular instruments. Many legislative instruments are made, either wholly or in part, to implement undertakings given by ministers to the committee to amend principal instruments to meet its concerns. In such cases the committee considers that the Explanatory Statement should mention this fact, so that the Senate is kept informed of the types of matters raised by the committee. From time to time explanatory statements fail to do this and the committee writes to the minister who then replies that he or she has asked the department to comply with the committee's request.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee was, therefore, surprised by its scrutiny of the Family Law (Child Abduction Conventions) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1996 No 74, which corrected a significant breach of personal rights detected earlier by the committee. The Explanatory Statement, however, did not refer to the committee. The committee then wrote what it thought was a fairly routine letter to the minister asking if he could advise the committee that he had asked the department to ensure that explanatory statements include this information. The minister unexpectedly replied to the effect that on one view there might be some advantage in limiting an Explanatory Statement to the purpose and effects of amendments without reference to their policy or other background. This would ensure that explanatory statements are not complicated. The minister further advised that the committee should seek the advice of all ministers who issue explanatory statements if it wished to pursue its views.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee was, as I say, surprised by this advice. In reply the committee advised the minister that inclusion of the role of the committee in explanatory statements was a long standing and universally accepted convention which had been established for some 15 years. The committee gave instances where the convention had been implemented by successive Attorneys&hyphen;General, Ministers for Justice and by the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. One of these explanatory statements mentioned the role of the committee in the first sentence. Another was an Explanatory Statement for earlier amendments of the same principal regulations in respect of which the minister now had  reservations. The committee advised that it was grateful for this previous cooperation, which was in accordance with the general acceptance of the convention by all portfolios. The committee advised the minister, however, that there may be merit in amending the Federal Executive Council Handbook to recognise the convention and that the committee would ask that this be done. The committee then did this. Subsequently the minister advised the committee that if its proposal was to be adopted by all ministers then an amendment to the Handbook would be appropriate to ensure that explanatory statements include the relevant material. The committee is grateful for this helpful cooperation from the Attorney&hyphen;General, the Hon Daryl Williams MP.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5190"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee wrote separate letters to the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister, the Hon Chris Miles MP, about each of the two matters of concern in respect of explanatory statements. The letter about notification of mandatory statutory consultation attached a copy of the statement which I made to the Senate on behalf of the committee on 12 November 1996, advising that in the light of the conclusions in that statement that the Federal Executive Council Handbook should be revised as soon as possible to include a requirement that the Explanatory Statement should refer to the provisions of the enabling act under which an instrument is made and of any mandatory statutory procedures before making. The letter about acknowledging the role of the committee attached a copy of its most recent letter to the Attorney&hyphen;General, which set out its views in detail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee is now pleased to report that both its proposals have been accepted. The Secretary of the Federal Executive Council has advised the committee that a circular will be sent to all departments and agencies advising of the committee's requirements. The circular will have the effect of a revision of the Federal Executive Council Handbook. This is a most satisfactory outcome, which will assist the committee and individual Senators to scrutinise legislative instruments. The committee is grateful for the cooperation of the Parliamentary Secretary, the Hon Chris Miles MP, which demonstrates a commitment to parliamentary propriety. The committee also thanks the Secretary of the Federal Executive Council.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5190"><TITLE>Regulations and Ordinances Committee</TITLE><DEBATE.SUB2 PAGE="5190"><TITLE>End of Sittings Statement</TITLE>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the sittings the Committee continued its non&hyphen;partisan scrutiny of the usual large number of disallowable legislative instruments tabled in the Senate, made under scores of parent Acts administered through virtually every Department of State. Legislative instruments implement administrative details of almost every program established by Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee acts on behalf of the Senate to scrutinise each of these instruments to ensure that they comply with the same high standards of parliamentary propriety and personal rights which the Senate applies to Acts. If the Committee detects any breach of these standards it writes to the Minister or other law&hyphen;maker about the apparent defect, asking that the instrument be amended or an explanation provided. If the breach appears serious, or if
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Committee has not received a satisfactory reply from the Minister, the Chairman of the Committee gives notice of a motion of disallowance of the offending instrument. This allows the Senate, if it wishes, to disallow the instrument. This ultimate step is rarely necessary, however, because Ministers almost invariably take action which satisfies the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As usual, during the sittings Ministers gave the Committee undertakings to amend many provisions in different instruments or parent Acts to meet its concerns. The Committee is grateful for this high level of cooperation from Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the present sittings the Committee scrutinised 902 instruments, compared to 1021 for the sittings in the first half of 1996. Of these, 203 were from the statutory rules series, which are generally better drafted and presented that other series of legislative instruments. The other 699 instruments were the usual heterogeneous collection of different series.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each of the 902 instruments was scrutinised by the Committee under its four principles, or terms of reference, which are included in the Standing Orders. There were 100 apparent defects or matters worthy of comment in those 902 instruments. The defects are described below under each of the four principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Principle (a)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is delegated legislation in accordance with the statute?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This principle is interpreted broadly by the Committee to include not only technical validity but also every other aspect of parliamentary propriety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Technical validity is, however, an important aspect of the work of the Committee. For instance, under s.49A of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Acts Interpretation Act 1901</EMPHASIS>  delegated legislation may generally incorporate material apart  from the provisions of Acts or other delegated legislation only as it existed at a particular time and not as amended from time to time. Several instruments purported to incorporate variable material, including in one case material from a foreign organisation. Another included some provisions which expressly limited some incorporated material to a particular date, but which did not do so for other incorporated material. Numbers of enabling Acts provide for mandatory procedures to be followed by the Minister or others before delegated legislation is made. In the case of several instruments, however, there was no indication either on the face of the instrument or in the Explanatory Statement that this had been done. Instruments cease to have effect if not tabled in both Houses within a specified period, generally 15 days. In several cases it was possible that powers had been exercised under provisions which had ceased to have effect for this reason. As usual, several instruments appeared to be void for prejudicial retrospectivity. One instrument was tabled without schedules which included the substantive provisions of the instrument.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5191"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that the drafting of delegated legislation should be of a quality not less than that of Acts. In this context some instruments were made with no making words at all. Others included inaccurate statutory references in the making words. Some provisions, including making words, were incomplete. Numbers of instruments were made under the wrong provision of the 1,000 page long enabling Act under which they were made. The date of making of one instrument was indicated only by the year. Many instruments included cross&hyphen;reference errors. Several instruments did not provide for numbering or citation. Two instruments had the same citation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other drafting deficiencies included unclear drafting, drafting errors, vague and subjective expressions and gender specific expressions. Numbers of redundant instruments were not revoked. Several instruments provided for the permissive "may" although it appeared that the mandatory "must" was intended. This was the case even though other similar provisions used "must" and, in one case, the provision related to an entitlement to the payment of money. Several instruments did not appear to effect the legislative intent expressed in the Explanatory Statement. In one case this related to the power of the Minister to vary rates of mining royalty. One instrument purported to include substantive provision in Notes, which are intended only to be illustrative or informative. Information in Notes to another instrument was wrong. One instrument did not include the usual pink slip erratum attachment when this should have been done. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee ensures that legislative instruments do not breach parliamentary propriety. Several instruments purported to be made by departmental memoranda to the Minister with the making action by the Minister consisting of ringing the word "agreed" in the memorandum. In one of these cases the putative instrument included cryptic handwritten anonymous and undated annotations by persons apparently not the Minister. In one case there was considerable delay in making legislative guidelines but the Explanatory Statement advised, in effect, that there was nothing to worry about because the administrators had acted as if they had been made. The making of several regulations which were financially beneficial to individuals was delayed for up to two years. Several instruments missed the opportunity to implement undertakings given to the Committee. Some instruments provided for levels of delegation of powers which may not have been appropriate. Others may not have limited sufficiently the appointment of authorised officers who could exercise powers under legislative instruments. Several sets of regulations amending the same principal instrument were made on the same day, with no apparent reason for the duplication.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee ensures that all legislative instruments are accompanied by proper Explanatory Statements. Numbers of Explanatory Statements were inadequate or misleading.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The Explanatory Statements for four sets of regulations remaking regulations disallowed earlier by the Senate did not refer to this. On behalf of the Committee the Chairman made a statement to the Senate on 25 June 1997 on recent action in respect of Explanatory Statements, reporting that the Federal Executive Council Handbook would be effectively revised to meet the concerns of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Principle (b)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee interprets this principle broadly, to include every aspect of personal rights. During the present sittings the Committee detected the following possible defects in delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee writes to the Minister about any instrument which might affect the rights of individuals. One instrument provided for members to be removed summarily from statutory committees. Another did not provide a right for people to respond to adverse material before a decision was made. Another did not require consultation with the affected person before an exemption was cancelled. One provision for a search warrant did not include the usual reasonable force safeguard. One instrument provided for non&hyphen;prescribed search warrants in electronic form with no indication of the usual safeguards. Another provided for powers of entry by private firms, broader than those which police have in the absence of a warrant, which did not appear to include appropriate safeguards. Other provisions for powers of entry did not require those entering to produce photographic identification. As usual, instruments also provided for strict liability and for reversal of the usual onus of proof.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One instrument provided inadequate safeguards for people required personally to produce documents in court. Another instrument did not include the usual safeguard that substantial rather than strict compliance with forms is sufficient. In one case a roll of voters was not available for public inspection. The Explanatory Statement for another instrument did not indicate that the Privacy Commissioner had been consulted about the release of personal information. The Committee scrutinised numbers of instruments providing for penalties imposed by infringement notices, not all of which provided for adequate safeguards. Several did not provide for notice to those affected of the beneficial consequences of paying an administrative penalty rather than going to court. The Committee noted apparent deficiencies in some infringement notices which could be issued by private firms and in penalties which could be paid on the spot. Several of these instruments provided for more than one infringement notice for the same act or omission. Another provided for minor offences to be subject to infringement notices but did not appear to define minor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee questions any provisions which may be harsh or unfair. One instrument provided for time limits within which public officials must make a decision in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5192"> respect of some decisions but not for other similar decisions. Another imposed reasonability requirements on some actions by public officials but not others. One instrument provided for costs for court witnesses with professional qualifications to be ten times higher than costs for ordinary witnesses. Another instrument provided that government bodies could give notice to members of the public by prepaid post but did not provide this privilege for those responding to the notices. One instrument which provided for the Commonwealth to take over leases at airports appeared to breach the rights of creditors of the former lessees. One instrument removed the right of a miner to renew a mining lease for a further 21 years and replaced it with a determination by the Minister. Another instrument required people to use a particular computer system without explaining how that system was selected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee ensures that determinations affecting Commonwealth employees are fair. One instrument appeared to leave a time during which allowances would not be paid to members of the Australian Defence force. Another may not have provided for full reimbursement of the costs of selling a house. Another may not have included adequate safeguards in respect of payment by the Commonwealth of part of medical insurance premiums for certain staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Principle (c)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation make rights unduly dependent on administrative decisions which are not subject to independent review of their merits?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many legislative instruments provide for Ministers or other public officials to exercise discretions. The Committee considers that such discretions should be as narrow as possible, include objective criteria to limit and guide their exercise, and include review of the merits of decisions by an external, independent tribunal, which would usually be the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Numbers of instruments provided discretions which affect business or which have a commercial effect. One instrument provided for parentage testing for family law purposes by accredited laboratories. Such accreditation was not only commercially significant but also affected personal rights because the results of such testing were admissible in proceedings. In this case, however, there was no review of the accreditation process. Another instrument provided for an accreditation process the procedures for which were quite vague but which had significant commercial consequences, again with no review. The package of instruments which provided for the leasing of Commonwealth airports included numbers of decisions which could have an adverse commercial effect. Some of these decisions were subject to AAT review, some to internal review and some to no review at all. Decisions made by the internal review did not appear to be subject to AAT review. Some decisions could be made by State or local government agencies and by non&hyphen;government companies.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One instrument provided for important commercial discretions in relation to whether motor vehicles complied with the required engineering standards. Another instrument provided for review of a decision to refuse or to cancel a commercially significant exemption, but not for review of a decision to impose conditions on the exemption. The Explanatory Statement for another instrument expressly advised that it included a discretion which was aimed at commercial importation but which did not appear to be subject to review. Another apparently unreviewable commercial discretion affected the balance date of companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee carefully scrutinises instruments which affect personal rights. One instrument provided only subjective criteria for a discretion to exempt a person from payment of a fee. Other instruments provided inadequate criteria. Another instrument appeared to provide for discretions but did not indicate who was to make the decisions or what would happen if there was a dispute about the relevant facts. There were other instances of  discretions which were not clearly drafted. One instrument provided a discretion to permit individuals to inspect and take copies of a roll of voters. Another instrument did not provide for review of discretions relating to penalty provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Principle (d)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation contain matter more appropriate for parliamentary enactment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee does not raise this principle as often as its other three principles. Nevertheless, it is a principle which goes to the heart of parliamentary propriety and complements the first principle, that an instrument should be in accordance with the statute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other developments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to its main task of scrutinising legislative instruments, the Committee was active in other ways during the sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee tabled its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Hundred and Fourth Report</EMPHASIS> , the Annual Report for 1995-96, on 25 June 1997.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report deals with the operations of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills during the 37th parliament from May 1993 to March 1996. It contains statistical data and analytical discussion of the scrutiny that has been carried out during that period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report should prove particularly useful to senators, ministers and their advisers as it contains an analysis of how the committee has applied the criteria of scrutiny set out in its terms of reference. These are reproduced towards the beginning of the report. The report welcomes an increase in the level of ministerial response to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> committee comments that has taken place during the 37th parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee appreciates the setting out in the explanatory memorandum of reasons for a bill containing provisions that may be considered to infringe the terms of reference. This practice greatly assists the committee and the Senate. Of equal assistance have been the ministerial responses which treat the comments of the committee as constructive, positive efforts to improve the quality of information available to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee has paid close attention to proposed legislation which results in diminishing human rights or results in a dissonant giving over of the legislative power of parliament and of on-going parliamentary scrutiny of the delegated exercise of that power.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A legislative scrutiny committee depends to a large extent on the input of its legal adviser and its secretariat. The committee has been fortunate to have the services of Professor J L R Davis of the Law Faculty of the Australian National University as its legal adviser, and of Peter Crawford as secretary, Sue Blunden as part-time research officer and as administrative officer Margaret Lindeman, and before her, Claire Dace and before Claire, Jacquie Hawkins. On behalf of the committee, I wish to record our thanks to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Scrutiny of Bills Committee is effective only when it receives support from both ministers and senators.

I notice you were not a member of the committee during the 37th parliament, but you have been a considerable member in the years before that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will mention the chairmen of this committee over this last period of the 37th parliament. The chairmen were: Senator the Hon. Michael Tate, who has gone on to greater things; Senator Colston, who I think was chairman not only of this committee but also of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, and served well on both; and Senator Troeth, who was the first chairperson under the new way of doing things where a non-government member chaired the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to pay a lot of respect and give high praise to Senator Troeth because she set up in the committee in its present form very well, having taken over from Senator Colston, who was the last of the chairmen under the old system. I also mention Senator Vanstone, who was deputy chairperson for many years. Senator Michael Forshaw was deputy chairperson too at one stage. Then there was Senator Bell; Senator Carr, who is also a member; me; Senator Ellison, who on anything to do with legal matters and proper process is outstanding; and Senator Tierney, who was a member of that committee, as he may well remember.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I also just take a few more moments to talk about the staff. Without the staff, this committee, like any committee, is absolutely doomed to disaster. The committee secretariat has kept this committee going. We are fortunate to have the services of Professor Davis of the Law Faculty of the Australian National University. He has been the committee's legal adviser for many years. Peter Crawford, who is the secretary, took over from Stephen Argument. That was a very big task, but Peter has been quite outstanding as secretary.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a very useful and very timely report. What the report is called&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Not a level playground&mdash;</EMPHASIS> describes what the committee found in its investigation. The report highlights the growing inequity between schools, which is particularly exacerbated by private and commercial funding. The evidence also shows conclusively that government funding is insufficient for core funding of schools for our children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These findings of our committee of inquiry are very much to the fore at a time when we
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5195"> have this government's decision to take over $1,700 from public schools per child for every child who enrols in a private school as part of the new education benchmark adjustment program. At the same time it is further confirmed by the statement put out by the state ministers for education after a Commonwealth&hyphen;state ministers meeting in Darwin not too long ago. This report, which I will briefly quote from, was referred to in the  <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on Friday, 13 June:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At yesterday's Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs meeting in Darwin, all seven Coalition education ministers signed a document accusing the federal Coalition of "trying to minimise its contribution to government schools by cost&hyphen;shifting between state and non&hyphen;state school systems".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Our report was not designed, and did not set out initially, to look at the adequacy or not of government funding, but its inadequacy became very clear, and just about 100 per cent of the people making submissions and then attending the hearings confirmed that very important point. As we have had over the last 20 years or so devolution of responsibility to schools and with that a growing requirement for schools to raise some of their funds privately, particularly through voluntary contributions, we have seen highlighted not only the inadequacy of school funding but also the obvious and exacerbated inequity of school funding by the private contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also had very bizarre arrangements from state to state where voluntary contributions have been considered when they are not paid as justification for state governments to be able to send in the debt collectors to collect voluntary contributions. This situation has been proposed in my state of South Australia, with in very recent days the education minister, Mr Lucas, admitting that it is not a possibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A voluntary contribution, as this report highlights, is just what it says: a voluntary contribution. But in fact the committee also heard lots of evidence that suggests that, when people cannot pay their voluntary contribution, children are actually very much punished and penalised. Some of the examples listed in this report on page 55 refer to evidence that, for example, in some schools there is the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> withholding of academic reports; there is the barring of students from graduation ceremonies and other school functions; and there is a link between student enrolment or re&hyphen;enrolment on the payment of levies. As well, student school diaries have been provided to students only if they pay their levies. We have seen students being required to be seated in the front of classrooms and acknowledged as being there&mdash;sitting in those places&mdash;because they have not paid their contribution. There are many more examples, and they are listed in this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has also emerged is that the private funding of schools has led to an enormous stress on parents, and the humiliation and public vilification of students. This is no way in which to ask parents and students to participate in the community of education that our schools are. The cutback of government funding&mdash;the insufficiency of the funding to keep pace with the requirements of our schools&mdash;and now the clear statement by all the state ministers that the funding is insufficient for the task makes this report very timely and very pertinent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were asked to look at not only voluntary contributions but also other levies, charges, excursion fees, subject levies and so on. All of those again highlight exactly the same difficulties. For some schools in the so&hyphen;called `eastern suburbs', there is not nearly the same problem as there is in the lower socioeconomic areas. We heard from the state departments and the state governments that most of them have some formula or other by which they allocate education dollars to try to deal with inequities. When you talk about the different schools from lower socioeconomic areas to the eastern suburbs, or the higher socioeconomic areas, the government departments have a funding formula to try to minimise or do away with that kind of inequity, yet the private funding of schools is actually exacerbating the inequity. It is running exactly counter to the intention of state departments in their funding for state schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very strong in our recommendation that sufficient government funding be provided for free public education, meaning, as we
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5196"> describe it, for the core eight learning areas, and I do not believe there is any way we can move away from that. I have no doubt that other people would want to say, `But you know governments can't find that funding. You know government schools are an increasing demand on the public purse.' We say, `If you have governments acting on their education acts that refer to free public education, that is what it should mean for those core learning areas.' We also appreciate that the parental contribution over the years has been something that assists with schools, but it has in the past been for moderate sums of money for moderate projects extra to the demands of core education. We believe that contribution should continue. We acknowledge the importance of it, but we make it clear that it should not be used to fund core funding for education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also looked at sponsorship. Public records and lots of press reports will have already highlighted for people the problem of sponsorship. We have seen the difficulties that come with something like the McDonald's proposal or schools' proposals that McDonald's assist with, for example, reading. Indeed, most state governments are now aware that there need to be some kinds of guidelines regarding sponsorship. We have also highlighted that inequity is further exacerbated by sponsorship, with some schools much more readily able to get sponsorship and others unable to raise up to $1,000 over a whole year. It depends on the socioeconomic background of the schools, and we make very strong recommendations that sponsorships, particularly of any significant amount, should be provided to support schools at the state level so that the state governments can disburse the sponsorship benefits in a manner that is equitable and additional to the requirements of core funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also highlight the fact that one of the reasons the state governments and the Commonwealth itself are having difficult in keeping up with the funding is the significant changes in our schools over recent years. In particular, when the Labor government came into office, something like 37 per cent of children finished year 12. It rose to over 80
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> per cent; it is a little further back from that now. But, even so, that is a massive increase in the number of children attending our schools. Funding has not been sufficient to keep up with those increased demands. When you add the demands of technology, the inequity is highlighted, as is the insufficiency of funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have drawn attention to the fact that some schools have very easily been able to acquire the funds to introduce computers&mdash;including access to the Internet&mdash;and other things that go with the capital cost, the recurrent cost, of maintaining high technology in  schools. Other schools, of course, are still struggling to get their first computer. We have made recommendations regarding the need for governments at both Commonwealth and state level to have a policy about the introduction of technology, its place in education, the need for teachers to be trained and the need for more work to be done on how the new technology is incorporated in teaching methodology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very useful report. It picks up on and is in response not to recent changes, but some 20 or more years of information that we have regarding parental contribution. There is an absolutely vital need for governments to more closely monitor what those funding amounts are and the equity considerations and consequences of private funding supplementing the public funding of schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report concludes that, without any doubt, public funding of our schools is not sufficient to the task. It strongly recommends that we make sure the commitment to free public education and the ongoing contribution of core funding is maintained.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, I thank you for your persistence in this matter. I was saying that there was once a time when governments were proud to spend money on education. For them, it was a boast to say that they were spending more than other states and other governments on education, and that they were doing so as an investment in the future&mdash;an investment in the welfare and prosperity of future generations of Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An unfortunate fact of life is that governments now boast about how little they spend on education. My own state in particular, Madam Acting Deputy President, as you would be only too well aware, has an appalling record that has replaced that once proud boast. The appalling record now is that governments are able to claim that they spend less than other governments on education. In the case of Victoria, only 10 years ago Vic
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> toria spent more per capita on education than any other state. Victoria probably now spends the lowest amount per capita, if I recall the recent Grants Commission reports of the impact that that has on families&mdash;to use the lexicon this government so proudly uses. Of course, that means that the level of disadvantage is growing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report highlights the fact that not all Australians are able to privately contribute on an equal basis with one another. It is the role of the government and of the states to meet certain national responsibilities. Of course, that is consistent with our international obligations, as well as with our domestic obligations to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a sorry state of affairs that, because this Commonwealth government has continued its appalling record of insisting that we spend less on education, employment and training, total government outlays have been reduced from some 11 per cent of whole of government expenditure to nine per cent within a four&hyphen;year period. As a consequence, the real danger is this trend towards the privatisation of what was once regarded as a proud boast of national and state governments&mdash;privatisation of the commitment to individuals. Increasingly, schools are required to rely upon private and commercial funding of public education to the extent that there are now schools in this country that require parents to provide students with their own toilet paper. It is a ridiculous state of affairs that basic amenities, basic facilities, are no longer being provided by the state. For instance, the Brotherhood of St Laurence has highlighted in one of their studies that it has reached the stage that the average cost to parents per primary school child for schooling requirements is some $460. The average cost for a secondary child is now some $866. I regard that as a fairly conservative estimate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the way that is broken down into uniforms, books, fees, levies and various excursions, if you consider that many families would have more than one child at school at any particular time, it is not unreasonable in terms of the evidence received by this committee that the requirement for the average family is to find some $40 a week to keep
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5198"> children at school. For those who are on high incomes that might not matter, but for those on lower incomes $40 a week becomes quite an enormous burden to bear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it means that some families are not able to meet the requirements and the demands being placed upon them by school authorities. As a former teacher myself I understand the pressures sometimes placed on families by school administrations to find the additional money to meet the requirements that are no longer being met by state government and by this government nationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pressures are applied to parents to meet the requirements of these so&hyphen;called voluntary levies, and it is increasingly the case that they are no longer voluntary. What it means is that large numbers of people cannot actually pay the demands that are being made. As Senator Crowley has pointed out, we have heard in evidence that debt collectors have actually been sent in to enforce the payment of what are supposed to be voluntary levies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Brotherhood of St Laurence pointed out that that means that a lot of people who are not able to meet these requirements are forced to be stigmatised and pressured in a number of ways&mdash;to the extent that it affects the relationship between children at school and their teachers. The report highlights, for instance, various surveys undertaken by the Brotherhood of St Laurence of those who are having difficulties meeting the requirements and the demands being placed upon them by schools. Forty&hyphen;five per cent of those surveyed reported that they spoke less often to the teacher as a consequence of not being able to meet these demands. Fifty&hyphen;four per cent said that they had chosen not to attend school meetings. For parents, that means that they are less likely to participate in parent&hyphen;teacher interviews. Fifty&hyphen;one per cent said that they had not volunteered to help out at the school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government claims vigorously that it is in fact spending more on education. The truth of the matter could not be clearer. The department's own submission to this Senate committee&mdash;not to this inquiry but to another inquiry&mdash;has highlighted that this government is in fact cutting back moneys to public
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> education. As a result of the introduction of the enrolment benchmark adjustment, there will be, according to the department, some $26 million cut from public education in this financial year and $270 million over the forward estimates to the year 1999&hyphen;2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Crowley has indicated, every state and territory in the country is screaming about the introduction of the enrolment benchmark adjustment, which is a vehicle for the direct transfer of funds from public to private education in this state. It is a pattern similar to that which is emerging in so many areas of education today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What that really means is that those with the resources and the means will do well and those without will fall behind. It strikes me  that that is quite contrary to a fundamental commitment we ought to have to the provision of education for all. It is a real loss of opportunity for all in this country as a result of some Australians being left behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key to economic growth and prosperity is a vibrant, effective education system that does allow all to participate in it. What we are seeing increasingly&mdash;as this report highlights&mdash;is the growing disparity between those who can afford to participate and those who cannot. Equity provisions are now being fundamentally challenged by the actions that are being taken by this government in ensuring that those who have the resources will do well and that that those who have not will do poorly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It strikes me that it is an unfortunate fact of life that in terms of the education debate in this country the press has not paid great attention in recent times to these matters. They seem quite prepared to accept the nonsense that is coming out of ministers' offices about the level of expenditure on education. It is apparent that, despite what the minister has been claiming, the real resources going to education are declining and that the real resources to higher education, to schooling, and to the vocational education and training sector are declining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where there is an increase in expenditure, it is no more than expenditure for inflation and expenditure for increased enrolment as
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5199"> the population itself grows. There are no new budgetary allocations coming on stream to support the increasing demands that are being placed on the education system&mdash;and being placed in such a way that the level of inequality is inevitably going to grow as a result of the policies being pursued by this government.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that to enable this country to take full advantage of the social and economic opportunities presented by these developments, the Australian telecommunications industry must be constantly challenged to innovate in order to develop new services, increase quality and reduce prices.

Under the Telecommunications Act, a "telecommunications service" is defined as "a service for carrying communications by means of guided or unguided electric energy or both". The term "standard telephone service" is therefore technology neutral and does not exclude the provision of radiocommunications services. As the declared universal service carrier, Telstra currently uses radiocommunications technology in fulfilling its USO, particularly in rural and remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telecommunications Act 1997</EMPHASIS>  continues the use of the term "standard telephone service". In the new telecommunications legislation, the definition focuses on the functionality required of the "standard telephone service" and, as a starting point, the service is defined as a carriage service for the purpose of voice telephony or its equivalent for persons with a disability. The definition can be amended by regulations in two ways: to prescribe purposes for the service additional to those specified in the legislation, and to prescribe performance characteristics for the service. As the focus is on service functionality, the "standard telephone service" concept is technologically neutral and does  not preclude the use of radiocommunications or any other technology.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response to Point 2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Demand for modern radiocommunications technologies in rural and remote areas is a derived demand, based on demand for communications services in such areas. Market research is important both to commercial decision making and to inform policy development. However, the Government believes that the technologies used to deliver services should be a matter for commercial decision by carriers and service providers, based on assessment of the relative costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Restrictions on long range use of radiocommunications technologies in rural and remote areas are related to the physics of radiofrequency propagation, the availability of suitable equipment and the economics of service delivery to lowly populated areas. Frequencies in what is referred to as the High Frequency bands (3&hyphen;30MHz) have been used for decades to provide long range fixed and mobile communications. Australia has traditionally been a heavy user of these bands for this purpose. Because of their long distance propagation, the use of these bands must be co&hyphen;ordinated internationally so as to manage interference between countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The distance radio waves travel decreases as the frequency increases. Above the High Frequency band, radio tends to travel in a "line of sight" manner so that to provide area coverage in these higher bands requires many more transmission sites. The need for additional infrastructure adds to the costs of service delivery. Nevertheless, Telstra has very substantial networks called Digital Radio Concentrator Services (DRCS), operating in both the 500 MHz and 1500 MHz bands and providing telephony as part of its Universal Service Obligation. Telstra is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5206"> planning to upgrade the capacity of these networks. The technologies used by carriers to provide rural communications are not imposed by regulation. As a general rule, there is relatively light use of the radio spectrum above 30 MHz in rural areas and there is little difficulty in satisfying demand for access. Satellites have also been used to provide very wide area coverage for fixed, mobile and broadcasting services. These have traditionally been expensive and reliant on distant satellites in the Geostationary Orbit. In the last few years, there has been intense international interest in "Low Earth Orbit" satellite systems that are hoped to be able to provide satellite services more cheaply than previously. Australian delegations at international regulatory conferences have fought  very hard to get international agreement on the accommodation of these new services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is aware that technologies such as Low Earth Orbit satellite systems and spread spectrum local area networks (LANs) are currently being applied in rural and remote areas of the USA. The use of many such technologies in the USA is being facilitated by the existence of class licence arrangements under the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) spectrum management arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Spectrum Management Agency has had a number of discussions with prospective mobile satellite services for the provision of voice and data services in Australia and there is a high expectation that at least two consortia will be operating services by 1999. However, the Government believes that any determination about what technology to use to deliver services is a matter for service providers. In an environment of rapidly changing technology, a policy of technology neutrality has been adopted. Choosing technology is, quite properly, a commercial matter.</PARA>

In developing codes, industry must consult with the public. Before a code can be registered, the ACA must be satisfied that it will effectively deal with the matter to which it relates. Where industry does not develop a code of its own volition, the ACA may request it to do so. If a code is not developed, or fails, the ACA may make a mandatory standard with which all relevant industry participants must comply. Such a standard could deal with disconnection.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is giving effect to its election commitments by spending $9.9 million to bring SBS television to 700,000 Australians in five regional areas (Upper Murray, NSW mid north coast, Upper Namoi, NSW Central Tablelands, and Rockhampton) over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Expansion of SBS television to achieve the same reach as ABC terrestrial television (about 98 per cent of the population) has been roughly estimated by the National Transmission Agency (NTA) to cost between $90 million and $100 million in one&hyphen;off capital costs, and would require years of capital works.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SBS television signal cannot be accessed in rural Western Australia. Metropolitan Perth is serviced by a "sidelobe" or "beamlet" sourced from the South East beam which is received in Perth, time shifted to correct WA time, and retransmitted. The "beamlet" is centred on Perth and drops away rapidly in power, making it unavailable to most of Western Australia. Those who can receive it direct from the satellite view SBS in east coast time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To service Western Australia as a whole would require a dedicated satellite beam and time delay facilities. Following the introduction of such a beam, communities and individuals would need to install their own satellite reception equipment if they wished to receive SBS television in advance of provision of Government funded retransmission facilities. At present, using a B&hyphen;MAC analogue signal, the annual lease cost of a WA beam to SBS would be about $2.6 million per year. This is expected to fall to between $1.5 million and $1 million per year when Optus moves to the compressed digital video (CDV) transmissions in the second half of 1997. While the introduction of CDV will reduce broadcasters' satellite costs, direct&hyphen;to&hyphen;home viewers will need to replace their current reception equipment with a CDV receiver/decoder, estimated to cost between $1000 and $1200.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Communities in areas where the SBS television signal is available from the satellite may wish to consider installing a self&hyphen;help retransmission facility, if they wish to access SBS television before the Government installs an NTA retransmission facility. This involves a satellite reception dish and other reception equipment, a suitable receiver/decoder and a low power television transmitter. This option has been adopted by a number of communities, for example Bathurst, Broken Hill, Orange, Wagga, Charleville, Longreach, Mt Isa, Mildura and Swan Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State and territory governments can assist with retransmission arrangements. For example, SBS television is transmitted to Alice Springs, Katherine, Tennant Creek

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD" FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD" FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Committee recommends that AUSTEL, in consultation with the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, conduct a thorough review of call zones and their continuing relevance in the face of substantial price reductions resulting from the introduction of new technology and the effective "death of distance" to ensure that measurable benefits of competition are reflected in reduced consumer charges, especially over long distances. </EMPHASIS> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are currently no legislative prohibitions on Telstra or the other two carriers reviewing or introducing alternative charging (including zone) arrangements. However, both Optus and Telstra are required to offer to residential, charity and welfare customers an option of untimed local calls on the same basis as they were made available in 1991. The new legislation extends this provision to business customers for voice calls.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the extent that technology has caused the "death of distance", competition whether direct or through innovative service alternatives, is likely to translate into pricing benefits for customers. As the recommendation itself suggests, price reductions have already lessened the importance of distance as a pricing consideration. Charging distance bands have been increasingly simplified and off peak periods extended. Optus and Telstra have in some instances employed flat rate charging for national long distance calls (eg. Optus introduced a flat rate in January 1996 for such calls made during off peak and weekend periods.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Price caps on Telstra promote reductions in all tariffs, including for long distance calls, and prevent price reductions in areas of high competition from being funded through unjustified increases in other areas. Attempts by Government to unduly manipulate pricing can distort the operation and efficiency of the industry and should generally  be avoided, especially in competitive market sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Universal Service Obligation (USO) is intended to encourage the universal service carrier to provide standard telephone and payphone services at minimum cost. While Telstra is currently designated the universal service carrier for the whole of Australia, other carriers could seek to be designated the universal service carrier for a particular area if they considered they could provide the service more efficiently (and hence at lower net cost). The net costs of providing the service in that area would continue to be borne by the carriers in proportion to their market share.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from constraints on anti&hyphen;competitive tariffs, untimed local call requirements, price controls imposed on Telstra, universal service providers' charges and general prices surveillance, the new legislation envisages
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5209"> telecommunications pricing being a commercial matter for telecommunications carriers in response to increasing competition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) plays no role in the setting of prices or call charging zones and its charter excludes the consideration of complaints about prices. It is therefore unlikely that the TIO would have the relevant expertise to conduct the proposed review. In addition, consideration of changing the TIO's jurisdiction would be a matter for its Council and Board.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This document continues the practice of presenting to the Senate twice each year a list of Government responses to Senate and joint committee reports as well as responses which remain outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The practice of presenting this list to the Senate follows the resolution of the Senate of 14 March 1973 and the undertaking by successive governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in timely fashion. On 26 May 1978 the then Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) informed the Senate that within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible Minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the Government proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the then incoming government. The then Leader of the Government in the Senate announced this change on 24 August 1983. The method of response continued to be by way of statement. Subsequently, on 16 October 1991 the former Government advised that responses to committee reports would be made by letter to a committee chairman, with the letter being tabled in the Senate at the earliest opportunity. The current Government in June 1996 affirmed its commitment</PARA>
<PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports within three months of their presentation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The list does not usually include reports of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works or the Senate Standing Committees on Appropriations and Staffing, Selection of Bills, Procedure, Publications, Regulations and Ordinances and Scrutiny of Bills, though such reports will be included if they require a response. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. Responses to reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes which are tabled by the committee. Where a response has been made by way of Finance Minute, the date of presentation has been appropriately annotated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislation committees report on bills and on the provisions of bills. Only those reports in this category that make recommendations which cannot readily be implemented through the bill, and therefore require a response, are listed. The list also does not include reports by legislation committees on estimates.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL (No.1) 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the provisions of the Health Insurance Act 1973 which relate to the Professional Services Review Scheme to remove difficulties encountered since the scheme commenced in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Scheme was introduced by the previous government with bi&hyphen;partisan support and it is hoped these amendments will receive the same support from the Opposition as did the original bill from the now government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inappropriate medical practice is a matter of concern to this Government and these concerns have been highlighted in recent times as the oversupply in medical practitioners places greater pressure on practitioners to increase patient throughput and, in some cases, engaging in significant over servicing. Over servicing is detrimental to the health of patients and comes at a very high financial cost to the health system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The previous Government recognised that the measures in place prior to the Professional Services Review Scheme were not working and set about introducing a new way of investigating allegations of over servicing and inappropriate practice. The Professional Services Review Scheme is this Government's primary means of investigating allegations of inappropriate practice and taking action when those allegations are proven.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The refining and strengthening of the Professional Services Review Scheme provided by these amendments should not be of concern to the majority of practitioners. However, those practitioners misusing or deliberately abusing their privileged positions of trust under the current benefit arrangements are able to be investigated
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> under this Scheme and will be dealt with severely. The Government will continue to pursue practitioners found abusing the system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Professional Services Review Scheme sanctions are imposed by the Determining Officer following a peer review and a finding that the person under review has engaged in inappropriate practice. The separation of judicial and executive power is a foundation principle of the constitution and the provisions in existing section 106U have been amended to ensure that there can be no doubt that judicial power is not being exercised by the executive under this Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In place of the sanctions in paragraph 106U(1)(d) the periods of disqualification from access to Medicare in subsections 106U(3) and 106U(4) have been increased to 3 years and I have made it clear that where the sums involved are in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and a person's peers have found that there has been inappropriate practice the Determining Officer must obtain the proper recovery of taxpayers' money.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extremely large sums of Medicare benefits involved in cases of inappropriate practice under this Scheme is something about which it is expected Australians will feel justifiable outrage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the Determining Officer has a discretion to deal with degrees of culpability, I expect that in cases where the Determining Officer considers that there is a high degree of culpability, the full force of the sanctions in section 106U will be applied and that a substantial proportion of the amount will be required to be repaid and the person be disqualified for Medicare for a long time. No one can condone abuse of Medicare and cases with a proven high degree of culpability involving hundreds of thousands of dollars warrant strong action at the top end of the measures provided in section 106U.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the amendments that remove any doubt about the separation of judicial and executive powers, the bill makes a number of changes to improve the administration of the process of reviewing a practitioner's conduct. These include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">bringing the class of practitioners in Parts VAA and VA of the act into line with definitions contained elsewhere in the act;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">clarifying the test under which a Committee reports on the conduct of a practitioner;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">providing a clearer approach to calculating the amounts of Medicare benefits to be repaid; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">repealing the sampling provisions which have proved to be unworkable in practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Professional Services Review Scheme is the Government's primary means of investigating allegations of inappropriate practice and taking action when those allegations are proven. The proposed changes are essential to ensure that the Scheme is given every opportunity of achieving the objectives intended when first introduced in 1995.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA AMENDMENT BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to implement a package of enhancements to Australia's marine cargo liability regime. The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1991, which is often referred to as, the COGSA, deals with liability for loss or damage to sea cargoes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The package is the result of extensive negotiations with, and agreement by, all affected interests&mdash;shippers, cargo owners, carriers, shipowners, marine insurers and maritime lawyers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I seek leave to table the document which records the package of changes which maritime industry interests have agreed should be made to improve our marine cargo liability regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The COGSA operates by applying as domestic law in Australia an international convention and several protocols, collectively known as, the amended Hague Rules. However, the COGSA also provides for the possible future implementation of an alternative international convention, commonly known as, the Hamburg Rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill I have introduced to amend the COGSA deals directly with two of the seven items in the industry package&mdash;the Hamburg Rules trigger now contained in the COGSA, and with arbitration in Australia. The other five items in the industry package, dealing with documents, coverage of importers, deck cargo, duration of liability and liability for delays, will be implemented by regulations to be made under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Hamburg Rules trigger</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Hamburg Rules, although a more recent convention than the amended Hague Rules, have attracted very little support by major trading nations, including Australia's major trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Hamburg Rules trigger was first due to operate on 1 November 1994. Prior to that date, there had been vigorous debate between shipper interests proposing the implementation of the Hamburg Rules and carrier interests opposing this. In October 1994, both Houses of parliament passed resolutions to defer consideration of the question of acceptance or repeal of the Hamburg Rules for another three years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following this resolution an industry working group developed a compromise solution in which carriers conceded significant extensions in the protection offered to shippers, in return for the removal of the automatic trigger for the Hamburg Rules. I would like to congratulate the industry interests concerned on the spirit in which this process was conducted. This bill implements that compromise solution developed by industry</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, the automatic trigger provision will operate again on 20 October 1997 to bring the Hamburg Rules into force in the COGSA, and action is therefore needed to prevent this.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will remove that trigger and the requirement for a resolution of both Houses of parliament. In its place, provisions are inserted for the minister to conduct a review from time to time of the desirability of bringing the Hamburg Rules into force in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision for arbitration</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry has concerns that under the existing legislation, arbitration has not been available as an option for resolving disputes. The act will now make it clear that arbitration in Australia does not offend section 11 of the COGSA .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation making provision</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill includes a power to make regulations to implement the highly technical elements of the industry&hyphen;endorsed package dealing with:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Coverage of a wider range of contracts of carriage, including electronic documents by the COGSA ;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Providing coverage for importers in some circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Coverage of cargo agreed to be carried on deck, in certain circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Extending COGSA coverage from the current, hook&hyphen;to&hyphen;hook coverage to, terminal&hyphen;to&hyphen;terminal coverage; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Providing limited recompense for shippers' losses due to delays, except where the delays are excusable delays according to criteria well understood in the maritime industry, and which will be defined in the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes will extend the protection which the COGSA offers to Australian shippers, particularly exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concepts behind these changes can be simply expressed. However, given the nature of international conventions, the modifications to the amended Hague Rules to make these changes are technically complex and lengthy. Given the need not to overburden parliament's business agenda and recognising that the resources of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel are under pressure, it is quite appropriate that such technical matters be handled by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the bill includes a very precise regulation making power which will enable the subsequent drafting and making of regulations to implement these changes.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This might be regarded as an, Henry VIII clause, which is a clause that permits the making of regulations which have the effect of amending the operation of an act. However, such clauses are used in Commonwealth laws regularly, and enable the expeditious passage of legislation. The regulations are, of course, subject to disallowance, and will be required by the act to be made only after consultation with relevant industry stakeholders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, while the amendments will enhance the operation of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1991, they will have
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5225"> no impact on Commonwealth revenues or outgoings, and no direct financial impact on the industry.</PARA>

<PARA> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Introduction</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill contains several important amendments to five existing acts, the Air Navigation Act 1920, the Airports Act 1996, the Air Services Act 1995, the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959 and the International Air Services Commission Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Air Navigation Act 1920 Amendments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments concern the security screening of passengers boarding large commercial aircraft within Australia. The amendments represent a minor change to Australia's aviation security regulatory framework based on operational reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, arrangements under the Air Navigation Act 1920 make individual aircraft operators responsible for passenger screening for certain domestic and international aircraft operations. The responsibility for segregating passengers who have been screened, from those who have not, also currently rests with the airlines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In larger airport terminals around the country the favoured method for segregating screened persons before they board an aircraft is to screen into sterile areas. Sterile areas offer savings in security costs by minimising the required level of screening staff and equipment compared to screening passengers at individual gate lounges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the increasingly commercial approach being taken by airport terminal operators to non&hyphen;aeronautical revenue raising, more and more commercial activities, such as retail outlets, are being located within sterile areas, where the departing passengers tend to congregate. These activities are controlled by the operators of the passenger terminal buildings through the terminal operator leases and not by the airlines. The operation of these commercial activities, particularly the need to restock out of hours and some of the delivery practices for goods and services, do have an impact on the security of the sterile area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, the government proposes to centralise the responsibility for sterile area access control and passenger screening into the one organisation. This will be achieved by making terminal operators primarily responsible for passenger screening at sterile areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, these amendments will:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ensure that airlines remain responsible for what is carried on their aircraft and for passenger screening when a sterile area is not used to segregate passengers;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ensure that airlines remain responsible for the segregation of their passengers between a sterile area approved under the new arrangements and their aircraft;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">make operators of terminals, in which sterile areas operate, responsible for access control and passenger screening, with the Department of Transport and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Regional Development having the power to designate the sterile area and any conditions of operation; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ensure that these arrangements are sufficiently flexible to allow the Department to designate an airline or airlines (or other persons, with their consent) to be responsible for passenger screening into a sterile area where local circumstances indicate that this would give better security outcomes.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes a minor amendment to the Airports Act 1996, that allows fees to be levied under regulations made for the purposes of environment protection at leased airports. This will allow partial cost recovery of administrative expenses associated with processing administrative and other approvals under the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Air Services Act 1995 Amendment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Airservices Australia's primary function is to provide for the safe navigation of aircraft. This is essential in a large country with population centres separated by long distances. Australia's aviation industry plays an important role in providing rapid safe and reliable communication links&mdash;it is one of Australia's key strategic industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Airservices plays a vital role in this industry providing essential air traffic and other services to all participants. Given Airservices' special position, the government believes it has a key role to play in encouraging and promoting the overall benefits of an efficient aviation industry. Airservices will continually review the services it provides to ensure it is meeting industry's genuine needs and is not placing impediments in the way of growth in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this end Airservices must continually strive to provide its services by the most cost effective means, at the same time structuring its pricing as  far as practical to ensure industry participants are paying for the services they actually use.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I need to emphasise, however, that the change to legislation will not, in the government's view, require Airservices Australia to ensure the viability of any individual operator; nor will it require that the aspirations of any particular aviation sector be met.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since this government came to office, capacity for international services to and from Australia has increased by 17 per cent over the accumulated capacity increases of the past fifty years. That equates to an additional 135 Boeing 747 scheduled services per week available to fly to and from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Along with this massive increase in capacity available for Australian and overseas carriers to service the Australian market, there has been a rapid increase in the sophistication with which Australian carriers have approached their operations overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Like many Australian businesses, Australian international airlines' future growth can be enhanced by operating effectively and efficiently in overseas markets. As part of this development, Australian carriers will be seeking to establish networks combining overseas markets into a potentially fully integrated service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 1992, when multiple designation of Australia's carriers on international routes was introduced, the International Air Services Commission has been allocating Australian capacity for services between Australia and other countries in a process that has been widely acknowledged as transparent, independent and equitable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While not a major aspect of previous Australian carrier operations, the International Air Services Commission Act did however prevent the Commission from allocating capacity between points outside Australia available to Australian carriers under Australia's air services arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments in this bill will allow the Commission to rightly assume responsibility for this function from the Department of Transport and Regional Development in an orderly manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment represents the final step in ensuring the complete independence of capacity allocation from capacity negotiation and will provide certainty to Australian scheduled carriers the by confirming the Commission's role as the single independent authority for allocating all rights available under air services arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the structural complexity of international air services increases and Australian carriers become more sophisticated in the way in which they apply allocations of capacity to particular markets, the Commission will increasingly be called upon to consider the nature of any cooperation between Australian carriers, or between Australian carriers and foreign carriers and how that might affect the use of the capacity that the Commission allocates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill therefore provides additional guidance for the International Air Services Commission on what constitutes a "joint international service" for the purpose of allocating capacity, without reducing the Commission's flexibility in their determinations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Social Security (Access to Special Benefits for Newly Arrived Residents) Guidelines 1997, made under subsection 739C(1) of the Social Security Act 1991, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This may be a technical point but it is one that has important ramifications. The background to this is that since 4 March 1997 newly arrived residents have had to serve a two&hyphen;year waiting period for most social security payments, including special benefit&mdash;the payment of last resort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Social Security Act, however, by way of subsection 739A(7) provides that the two&hyphen;year waiting period for special benefit does not apply to a newly arrived resident if that resident has `suffered a substantial change in circumstances beyond the person's control'. We are talking here of a very limited and rigorous capacity for newly arrived residents to receive the benefit of last resort, that being the special benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should also be noted that subsection 739B of the Social Security Act provides that the secretary should decide whether or not a person has suffered a substantial change in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5227"> circumstances beyond that person's control, in accordance with the guidelines from time to time in force under subsection 739C(1).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today's issue goes to the question of the discretion of the secretary and whether this parliament should allow guidelines that would hamper the exercise of that discretion in accordance with the Social Security Act. It is the guidelines under subsection 739C(1) that we are debating today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me start by saying that there are already arrangements in law to guide the secretary. They are there to guide the secretary or the secretary's delegate in a decision on whether or not to grant a person's claim for special benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 729 of the Social Security Act sets out the general eligibility criteria for special benefit. A person may qualify if he or she meets the following prerequisites: no other social security income support payment is payable to them; the secretary is satisfied that the person is unable to earn a sufficient livelihood for the person and the person's dependants, if there are any, because of age, physical and mental disability, domestic circumstances or for any other reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That act was read together with the guide to the administration of the Social Security Act for special benefit. That guide is already in place and is well established. It does provide advice on such issues as the need to determine whether a person is likely to be on a special benefit, short term or long term; what level of available funds would be considered insufficient, given the short-term or long-term nature of the person's circumstances; and how to respond in those common circumstances where the special benefit might be claimed&mdash;for example, expectant mothers, repatriated distressed Australians, carers otherwise unable to qualify for the carer pension, local disasters and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately the decision to grant or not grant a special benefit rests on the exercise of discretion by the secretary or his or her delegate, taking into account all the circumstances of a person's particular case. What the guidelines that we are attempting to disallow today do is take away that discretion.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a matter that has been previously considered by this parliament and particularly by the Senate. It is an issue which has already arisen in a number of contexts. For instance, when the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee considered the newly arrived residents waiting period legislation just a little while ago, it recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that guidelines made pursuant to the proposed section 739C should not be exclusive and should allow the Secretary of the Department of Social Security to exercise a general discretion to grant special benefits if in his or her opinion the person "has suffered a substantial change in circumstances beyond that person's control."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So it has already been the view of the legislation committee of this house that the secretary should be able to have general discretion to grant a benefit in accordance with existing law and guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not just the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee that expressed a point of view in respect of the structure of exercising one's discretion here. This issue was also raised and canvassed in the Senate, when it was debated once again just a little  while ago in the context of that newly arrived residents legislation. The opposition parties and Senator Harradine expressed concern at the time, and there was a lengthy exchange. It is worth putting on the record here the comments of Senator Newman as part of that exchange. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are talking about draft guidelines . . . I appreciate the efforts which some senators have made to make sure that the guidelines are as good as we can possibly make them so that they accommodate the needs of people who fall into difficulties . . . Some senators have already made proposals to me for some changes to them. So the department is continuing to try to get those guidelines in a form which will be acceptable to make sure that people do not fall between the cracks . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That might be what they were trying to do but, by bringing in the guidelines that they brought in, they are actually creating the cracks through which people will fall, can fall and will fall in increasing numbers. That is the concern that we have on this side of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that there have been discussions between the opposition and the government about the details of the guidelines. I am told
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5228"> that the minister was fortunate not to have attended one particularly long and arduous meeting in March between staff of her department, staff of her office and staff of the opposition. Despite the fact that the draft guidelines had been around for some months, I think it is fair to say that opposition staffers, during that meeting and during this process, have identified a number of actual errors in the drafting instruments, which have subsequently been corrected in the version that we are considering disallowing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite all that, there are still a number of issues left. As I say, what we are concerned about is that the guidelines are too rigid and the rigidity works against discretion in needy circumstances. There were points taken up by the government, but there are a number of other points which were made during those discussions which have not been taken on board. They now leave us in a situation where newly arrived residents who have suffered a change of circumstances which happens not to appear on the guideline list of acceptable changes and circumstances will definitely fall between the cracks and will be left destitute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are wondering what sort of rigidity we are talking about, I will just mention one example now and go to some others later on. Under the government's guidelines, as they are currently worded, a sponsored migrant, for instance, can be granted special benefit if their sponsor leaves Australia permanently. The sponsored migrant cannot be granted special benefit if that sponsor leaves Australia temporarily, albeit for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have suggested in this context that the government change the word `permanently' to a phrase or a form of words which would accommodate a period of at least X months, but that suggestion has not been taken up. I say this because this is evidence of the fact that we have tried consistently to get a constructive outcome to the problem facing us. But, at the end of that process, there were issues left unresolved and there are guidelines that are in place which will, as I say, create cracks for people to fall between.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The guidelines essentially do three things. Firstly, they codify a test for financial hard
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ship, which is the same as the existing short-term available funds test which already exists. The secretary has no room to take into account the fact that a newly arrived resident may be in long-term financial hardship, so the long-term available funds test should apply. Secondly, they codify the circumstances in which a person might not be expected to rely on a sponsor for their support&mdash;either, for instance, where the sponsor is in gaol or is dead and so on, and so can be granted special benefit. Thirdly, they codify the circumstances in which an unsponsored person might be considered to have suffered a change in circumstances beyond their control and so can be granted special benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The guidelines do three things but, as I say, they do not provide the flexibility that is needed for a full exercise of discretion in needy circumstances, unforeseen circumstances. They are too prescriptive. In terms of that prescriptiveness, I think the one organisation that has done an extremely impressive job on pointing out where some of the cracks are is the Welfare Rights Centre. They point ed out the guidelines prescribing the circumstances in which sponsored migrants, for instance, would not be expected to rely on their sponsor for support. They do not cover circumstances where, for instance, the sponsor simply refuses to support the complainant and evicts them due to a breakdown in the relationship between the sponsor and the claimant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sponsor might qualify for social security payment but is not actually being paid that payment because it is subject to a newstart allowance penalty period or a compensation preclusion period. The sponsor may receive a carers pension, a sole parent pension or another social security income support payment not prescribed in clause 5. The sponsor may have filed for bankruptcy but has not been declared bankrupt as yet. The sponsor may not be supporting the claimant due to the effects of mental illness or psychiatric disability, if they are actually a patient in a psychiatric institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The list goes on. It includes the sponsor being unable to provide support due to illness or disability but not being entitled to a dis
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5229"> ability support pension or sickness allowance because of income, for instance, received from their partner. The sponsor may have left Australia for an indeterminate period but not permanently. The claimant may be forced to move from the house of the sponsor because of abuse, violence or another reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these are genuine circumstances, genuine cases where we think there is a case to argue for exercising discretion. The Welfare Rights Centre says that these cases fall between the cracks. They have also done an assessment of the guidelines prescribing the circumstances in which an unsponsored person might be considered to have `suffered a change in circumstances beyond their control'. With respect to those, I think Welfare Rights has once again put together an impressive list of circumstances which are not covered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could, for instance, have a claimant who is a single mother near term in her pregnancy but not ill who is required to take leave without pay from her employer. The claimant could be a young person who has left home because of an abusive domestic situation and has left without any parental or other support. You could have a claimant who cannot work because of a short but serious rather than a prolonged illness. You could have a claimant who cannot work for a short rather than prolonged time due to the grief of the death of a family member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are so many situations like this. You can have an offer of employment which has been withdrawn before the claimant actually arrives in Australia but after all arrangements for emigrating to Australia have been finalised. You can have claimants&mdash;and this happens so often&mdash;who have been given incorrect advice about their employment potential in Australia. What happens even more often is claimants have problems with the recognition of their qualifications once they get here. That is a state based system which federal governments over the decades have tried to reform, but have not been fully successful in doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can have a claimant whose capital has been depleted for reasons beyond their control
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or a claimant whose business has failed but has not gone into receivership. You can also have a claimant whose funds have gone because of theft. Child claimants are also a problem. There are all these gaps that the guidelines do not pick up. We believe that the best way to handle this is to go to the pre&hyphen;existing situation, leave the discretion in the hands of the secretary or his or her delegate and let the guidelines that have applied in the past apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have another problem which goes very much to issues of the government's lawlessness and the question of the rule of law. There is a real question about whether these guidelines are in serious breach of the provisions of the act&mdash;the provisions which grant a general discretion to the secretary to grant special benefit. Welfare Rights have been pursuing these issues. I know it is their view that the guidelines are ultra vires, outside the authority of the law, but what worries me is that these concerns are raised not in isolation but after a number of other concerns have been raised by rights groups as to the administration of special benefit laws by the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, we might find that these guidelines are ultra vires, but it is going to take a lot of the money, time and resources of people who cannot afford to do it. We say that we should get it right now. The best way to get it right now is to knock out these guidelines. We have consistently put the view that the two&hyphen;year waiting period should not apply to special benefit, that payment of last resort, and that that final safety net should be available at the secretary's discretion to those who find themselves, for reasons beyond their control, without any other means of support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have these guidelines before us. We believe they are so prescriptive as to remove real discretion from the secretary in a large variety of unforeseen circumstances. Our concern is paralleled with a concern with the rights to redress mechanisms that this government is currently reviewing, such as the SSAT and review tribunals of a number of different portfolio areas. They are all under review at the moment. They are all under
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5230"> consideration for radical restructuring if not total abolition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government is about is not just taking away discretion but, through the denial of access to legal aid resources which have been cut back, and through a radical restructuring of the citizens administrative review tribunal mechanisms, leaving those with the least capacity to pursue their rights having least access to a much more limited range of mechanisms and legal remedies. We say to the government, `We have worked on this with you but, at the end of day, we believe your proposition is fundamentally flawed because it does not cater for the needs in so many serious circumstances.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting the disallowance motion moved by Senator Bolkus in relation to the guidelines for access to special benefits by newly arrived residents. The technical purpose of these guidelines under the Social Security Act is to provide guidance to the Secretary to the Department of Social Security in determining whether the two&hyphen;year waiting period for new migrants should be waived due to a person having `suffered a substantial change in circumstances beyond that person's control'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These guidelines apply only for people applying for special benefit. Many times in this place we have heard that benefit referred to as the payment of last resort for those people in need who do not fit into any other social security pigeonhole. The need for such guidelines came about when the government introduced the two&hyphen;year waiting period for new migrants and placed that two&hyphen;year waiting period on the special benefit, along with a raft of other social security payments, earlier this year. The Democrats had a lot to say about those particular changes. We voiced our concern about the impact of those changes on migrants and specifically on people in the community whom we could describe as among the least powerful. Certainly women and people from non-English speaking backgrounds are among the most disadvantaged in our community and were bound to be hardest hit by those changes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We strongly oppose the introduction of the two&hyphen;year waiting period. We thought it was an excessively harsh and mean&hyphen;spirited measure. We did not support it then and we still do not support it. However, it has to be stressed that this disallowance motion today is not a re&hyphen;run of that debate. It is not an attempt by the Senate to overturn that particular decision. What we are debating today is ensuring that the guidelines are such that they meet the oft repeated pledge of the government, as well as the wording of the legislation, that people whose circumstances change due to unforeseen developments and who have no alternative means of support will not be denied assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like Senator Bolkus did earlier in this debate, I would like to refer to some of the comments made by members of the government in relation to special benefit and some of the commitments that the government made on the access to the special benefit when we had the two&hyphen;year waiting period debate. I note that Senator Tambling in his speech on the second reading of the social security legislation on 26 November last year said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Special benefit&mdash;the safety net&mdash;will always be available to those new migrants who need assistance because their circumstances have changed since their arrival in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In fact Senator Newman, in response to a question from Democrat leader, Senator Kernot, said on 2 December last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we were absolutely up front. We made it clear that, if circumstances changed, special benefits would still be available.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I note that, when the legislation came back from the House of Representatives to the Senate on 11 February this year, the statement outlining the rationale behind that stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government continues to recognise the importance of ensuring that there is an adequate safety net to take care of those persons who suffer substantial changes in their circumstances beyond their control.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In looking at how these guidelines have operated, evidence is mounting that their effect has been to severely reduce and limit the secretary's discretion, rather than provide guidance to the secretary in exercising discretion. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5231">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Welfare Rights Centre, to which Senator Bolkus also referred, have expressed grave concern about how these guidelines are operating in practice and they have produced a number of case studies which show how people who are in real and severe hardship through no fault of their own are being denied access to income support. They say that there are any number of examples which are now coming to their attention. I know the government has provided some response to some of the Welfare Rights Centre's case studies outlining why each person should not be eligible. The Democrat response to that is that people are still being left in a situation where they are in dire financial stress through no fault of their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also frequent reports that the department of immigration is not adequately advising migrant applicants about the requirements of the two&hyphen;year waiting period. I am sure the minister's office is doing everything possible to make sure that complete and accurate advice is given, but reports indicate that that this is still not happening in some cases; that still some people are unsure of their rights. They are still, as Senator Bolkus said, falling through the cracks. I urge the government to redouble its efforts in this regard to ensure that full information is given to everyone who is considering migrating to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is, as Senator Bolkus outlined, significant evidence from groups, such as the Welfare Rights Centre, who are at the coalface of this issue dealing on a daily basis with people who are being impacted upon by these guidelines. But there is clear evidence that people are falling through the cracks. It is clear that the guidelines are operating in a way which leaves people in desperate circumstances and being denied adequate income support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recognise that there were draft guidelines circulated prior to the guidelines being gazetted but, as Senator Bolkus has said so succinctly, let us get it right now. I think he is correct in claiming that we are now actually seeing how the guidelines are operating. Clearly, there are loopholes. Clearly, there are difficulties when people are being denied
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benefits that we would argue are rightfully theirs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not forget that underneath all the political smoke about welfare or social security the Social Security Act is intended, at the end of the day, to provide assistance to people who are in need and who cannot obtain it through other means. That is the intent of the Social Security Act. In relation to special benefits, the bottom line is that this payment is there to assist people who are in extreme financial hardship and are incapable of obtaining adequate means of support from any other source.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that new migrants have a two&hyphen;year waiting period for special benefits is in the act. For this waiting period to be waived, the act requires that these people have had to suffer a substantial change in circumstances beyond the person's control. I repeat what I said in the debate when the House of Representatives sent the original social security legislation back to the Senate earlier in February this year: this benefit can only be accessed in special circumstances. Unfortunately, these guidelines define those circumstances in a restrictive and prescriptive way. It is constrained enough in that it is written in the act that there is the two&hyphen;year waiting period for the special benefit, that payment of last resort. We argued that the guidelines, as they are currently operating, are even further prescriptive and restrictive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also would like to note something that the Democrats were keen to put on record in earlier debates about the two&hyphen;year waiting period&mdash;that is, to dispel a few myths about migrants who come to this country, including that migrants are dole bludgers. They do contribute tax. They do not take that enormous step&mdash;often one of the biggest decisions they will make in their lives&mdash;to come to this country with some kind of intention of freeloading on our welfare systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth mentioning again that migrants already have to pass a series of tests concerning matters such as health, character and assurances of support before they are even allowed into this country. I know that this government, by virtue of some of its decisions and some of its comments, has been
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5232"> seen, certainly in the eyes of some welfare groups and the migrant lobby, to be attacking migrants and migration. I think the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) should have been a little more cautious when he entered into the rather complex and controversial debate about immigration and its effects on unemployment and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government could make one small gesture in light of the context of changes to migrant laws in this country&mdash;whether it is reduced funding or defunding for migrant representative organisations or whether it is the introduction of the two&hyphen;year waiting period for migrants when it comes to social security&mdash;to show that it is willing to consider the circumstances faced by migrants in need, this is it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that these guidelines are too prescriptive. They are almost totally inflexible. They are not guidelines; they are a straitjacket. It is for this reason the Democrats will be supporting the disallowance motion moved by Senator Bolkus. I acknowledge that the government's intent may have been honourable. But I say to it that the way these guidelines are impacting on people is very harsh. It is too harsh. It is causing real concern, real hardship and it means that people in dire financial and social circumstances are being denied benefits. I ask the government to look at the  actual impact on people and to develop a set of guidelines which will enable much more flexibility to be applied.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, if a person in a skilled migrant category  comes to Australia on the basis that there is a job for them and then there is a change in circumstances, for example, the place where they were going to be employed goes out of business, there is clearly a requirement in all justice to have a special benefit for that particular individual.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government opposes the opposition's motion for a number of reasons. In the constrained time available, I want to try to canvass some of the issues that I think should be on the record. There may yet be time to convince some people that their support for the opposition's motion is, perhaps, a little misguided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have always said that there would be a safety net for newly arrived residents who were serving the two&hyphen;year waiting period and found themselves in severe financial hardship because of an unforeseen change in their circumstances or the circumstances of their sponsor. We stand by that. This was clearly spelt out in our election document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS> which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition will provide a safety net in the form of a special allowance for those migrants whose circumstances change significantly after arrival in Australia for reasons beyond their personal control.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That safety net, in the form of limited access to special benefit, was delivered in the legislation passed by parliament in February of this year. Essentially, the speech which Senator Bolkus gave seems to me to be virtually a re&hyphen;run of the arguments which the opposition were using at that time. That was an argument against the legislation, of itself. My concern is that the opposition's motion is in fact allowing the backdoor route for people who would otherwise not be eligible under the legislation which this very chamber passed in February.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The guidelines which the opposition now seeks to have disallowed were determined under that legislation to provide  an administrative basis for the special benefits safety net. Setting down the guidelines for paying special benefit to newly arrived migrants in this way assists in consistency of decision making&mdash;and senators would be the first to criticise the government if we had a rash of inconsistent
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> decisions. You do need certainty and consistency both in decision making and in interpretation within the Department of Social Security but also within the tribunals that review the decisions. Having the guidelines available in this form and in this way also gives some certainty to new migrants on what constitutes a change of circumstances for the purpose of payment of special benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a number of recent criticisms of those guidelines, including by the Welfare Rights Centre. These criticisms, I believe, largely ignore the basic purpose of special benefit and they also display some lack of understanding about the provisions of the guidelines. In many ways the Welfare Rights Centre criticisms are more about the legislation imposing the two&hyphen;year waiting period, which, as I said earlier, has already been resolved by the parliament, than about the special benefit guidelines, which are the subject of this debate here tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My office has been provided with three case studies from welfare rights which purport to show some difficulty with the current special benefit guidelines we are debating tonight. First, we have not been able to substantiate the veracity of these supposed case studies from the information which the  Welfare Rights Centre would disclose to us. Second, on the basis of the information provided in the three case studies that I have seen, workers' compensation should be payable in one case and other social security payments in another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Special benefit is a discretionary payment available to people who are not eligible for any other form of income support and who, through circumstances beyond their control, cannot earn a sufficient livelihood. It is a payment of last resort. There is a tough dollar for dollar income test and a strict available funds test which ensures that only those in severe financial hardship can access the payment. As it is a payment of last resort it is clearly intended that people seeking special benefit make maximum use of their own resources or other available sources of support before turning to the taxpayer. That is not unique to those applying for special benefit;
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5234"> it is the basis of the social security safety net as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, the government considers that the available funds test, under which a person's available funds must be less than the equivalent of two&hyphen;weeks benefit, currently being applied to new migrants seeking access to special benefit is reasonable. This same test is applied to other people applying for special benefit and has been for a number of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Criticisms by the Welfare Rights Centre and opposition senators about the position of sponsored migrants demonstrates, unfortunately, a misunderstanding of the provisions of the determination. This is where I urge honourable senators to listen very carefully. They have concentrated on arguments that subclauses 5(2), 5(3), 5(5) and 5(6) do not cover every possible situation under which a newly arrived migrant might not be able to secure support from their sponsor. However, very importantly, subclause 5(1) provides that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A sponsored claimant can be paid special benefit if they have attempted to obtain support from their sponsor and can demonstrate that financial or in kind support cannot be obtained from any other source.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If ever there was a protection to make sure people do not fall between the cracks, as a couple of speakers have mentioned, surely subclause 5(1) provides that protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, subclauses 5(2), 5(3), 5(5) and 5(6) set out situations under which the claimant is not even required to attempt to seek support from the sponsor, for example, death, disappearance, change in the financial circumstances of the sponsor, abuse, or violence by the sponsor towards the claimant or a family member of the claimant. If a person in any of the circumstances put forward by the Welfare Rights Centre satisfies the secretary that they have attempted to obtain support from their sponsor, the attempt has genuinely failed and there was no support available from any other source, then that person could be paid special benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have also been criticisms of the causal link between the depletion of funds by unsponsored migrants and the change in their circumstances that leads them to apply for
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> special benefit. It is true that in some cases this will mean that some new migrants will not be able to receive special benefit even though they meet the available funds test. However, it cannot be said that the two&hyphen;year waiting period has been kept a secret from migrants. The advice that I have received suggests that immigration officials in overseas posts have been vigilant in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From March 1996 the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has been informing migrants, intending migrants, sponsors and intending sponsors that only in special circumstances will the Australian taxpayer support the new migrant during the first two years. This information was provided in the form of a comprehensive leaflet on the matter. Since August last year all visa grant letters have included four paragraphs alerting successful visa claimants to the two&hyphen;year migrant waiting period and providing a phone number where they can get more information from Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Immigration officials in Australia's overseas posts have been reminded on a number of occasions of the importance of drawing this matter to the notice of all intending migrants and those who have been issued with visas prior to April 1996. After migrants have received this information it is then the intend ing migrant's decision whether to migrate to Australia or not. Advice to intending migrants needs ongoing vigilance and I have been consulting with my colleague the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) to confirm that all reasonable actions are taken to ensure that intending migrants and their sponsors are fully informed of the two&hyphen;year waiting period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In answer to the example that Senator Harradine gave of the skilled worker, I am assured it is covered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concerns are that the Welfare Rights Centre may be scare mongering. The statistics from the department show that in the 12 weeks from 4 March this year there were only 110 reviews within the department of decisions to reject payment of special benefit in the waiting period&mdash;that is nationally. Thirty decisions were changed in favour of the

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do urge the senators to think very carefully before they support the opposition's proposal that we should use the previously applying guidelines. That simply means that the opposition is undermining the purpose of the two&hyphen;year waiting period legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new guidelines, while strict, are fair. They prevent people from accessing income support by the backdoor, when the legislation already passed by the Senate says that they are not eligible for income support.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. A couple of points have been made, and I think it is worth putting on record that the opposition does agree that the special benefit is a very strictly available one. There are strict requirements, as the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) has said. There is a tough dollar-for-dollar test. It is a discretionary benefit.

<PARA STYLE="Para">I thank the Senate. The presentation of this document, the Second Review of the Management of Safety of the Offshore Operations of BHP Petroleum, is important today. I would like to make some comments based on from initial reading of this report today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Barrell, who conducted this report, concludes that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Griffin Venture</EMPHASIS> was not placed in jeopardy only because gas-freeing operations had been halted, due to the actions of one of the vessel's junior officers. Dr Barrell also said that, if the gas-freeing operations had gone ahead as planned, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Griffin Venture</EMPHASIS> would have been placed in jeopardy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence shows that at all material times the intention of the master was to gas-free the tanks on the evening of 29 May 1994. The evidence also shows that the junior officer who stopped this from happening did so as a result of wilfully disobeying the direct order of the master and, as such, this action
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was not in accordance with his terms of employment. Putting the two together, it was the master's intention to undertake an action which would have placed the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Griffin Venture</EMPHASIS> in jeopardy. Therefore, by way of intent, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Griffin Venture</EMPHASIS> was in jeopardy at that time. The only thing preventing a catastrophe was the extraordinary actions of a single individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Barrell states that the BHP Petroleum mark 2 report was the trigger for the government report. This is not true. The fact is that it was the questions raised by me in the Senate on 1 March 1995, and the subsequent actions of Senator Bob Collins, which caused the government report to be written. Dr Barrell said that there was no evidence of cover-up. In fact, Dr Barrell was presented with evidence which proves a cover-up in several different areas&mdash;evidence which he has chosen to ignore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One example of a cover-up is the BHP Petroleum report in its mark 2 investigation. It is clear that at least two high ranking company employees, with the full knowledge and cooperation of the Dampier Manager of BHP Petroleum, gave incorrect evidence to the inquiry. The field superintendent of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Griffin Venture</EMPHASIS> said in his evidence on page 1, line 8:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hewitt remembers Visscher raising a question regarding the lack of a span test gas for testing the tank scope. He responded to the question by saying that they could not proceed beyond the point where the tank scopes became a crucial item until the span gas was on board the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Griffin Venture</EMPHASIS>  . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">et cetera. Andrew Brooks, the Production and Engineering Superintendent, confirms this statement in his evidence on page 23, line 11. In other words, they are saying that they were never going to gas-free the tanks on the evening of 29 May 1994 because the span gas would not arrive until the following day, 30 May 1994. Yet the evidence shows that at all times the intention was to gas-free the tanks on 29 May 1994. Evidence shows a statement in evidence by the field superintendent was never made, and that it was in fact incorrect. It subsequently formed the foundation of the mark 2 reports finding that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Griffin Ven
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5237"> ture</EMPHASIS>  was never in jeopardy because there was no intention to gas-free the tanks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BHP Petroleum mark 2 report contains information which is knowingly false. As such, by providing such report to a government investigator, it constitutes a breach of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act and is punishable by six months imprisonment. It can be shown that BHP Petroleum have knowingly withheld information. This is clearly indicated by the public comment of the President of BHP Petroleum, Mr Michael Baugh as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> dated 19 June 1996. Mr Baugh acknowledged yesterday that had he always believed Mr Visscher's version of events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the interests of long-term safety and accountability in the offshore oil and gas industry, the truth must be made publicly known. The truth will show that the Senate has been misled. The latest inquiry by Dr Barrell highlights many irregularities in company and regulatory operations. It still has holes you could drive a truck through. In my view, the report shows one thing of real importance: the truth could only come out in a forum where people are obliged to attend and provide sworn evidence&mdash;evidence subject to scrutiny. This obviously needs a minister's response.</PARA>

I mentioned to Senator Cooney that it was open for a resident to approach firstly an internal complaints mechanism set up by the provider within the facility, but it is also open for the resident to make use of external facilities for complaints. You would not necessarily have to go through the internal one set out by the provider first. You could opt for the outside course if you wished. Also, residents would have available to them various advocacy services which they could make use of within the facility. The provider also has an obligation to advise the resident of these outside reviews. I do not know whether that helps.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Minister, that does help. But there is another point I would like you to take up. I will go through it briefly. If you look at section 56&hyphen;4, you will see that it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The approved provider must:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) establish a complaints resolution mechanism for the aged care service;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then it goes over into subsection (2) and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the aged care service is a residential care service, the complaints resolution mechanism must be. . . provided for in the resident agreements. . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Subsection (3) says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the aged care service is a community care service, the complaints resolution mechanism must be. . . provided for in the community care agreements. . .
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5238"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the idea is that this complaints mechanism is going to be dealt with pursuant to agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at particular proposed sections of the bill, they say that there must be quality care provided by the provider, which I suppose you would imagine would be correct. For example, in division 2&hyphen;1(1) on page 4 of the bill, it says that the objects of this bill are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to promote a high quality of care and accommodation for the recipients of aged care services that meets the needs of individuals;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That would be one of the things that you would be wanting to ensure under this agreement. You would be wanting to ensure that the aged care recipient gets that high quality care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the ways the aged person can go around that is to make a complaint and to make use of this complaints resolution mechanism. The idea of a complaints resolution mechanism is a very good one, but the mechanism by which that is set up has me concerned because it is the provider who must establish the complaints resolution mechanism. Since the provider with whom the aged person is in dispute is the person who is going to set up the mechanism, there is an in&hyphen;built capacity to lead to a perception that this disputes mechanism is going to be biased against the aged person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the first thing. I was wondering whether there could be a better means of getting to a complaints resolution mechanism other than through that way. The next thing I want to say is that all this has been done pursuant to an agreement pursuant to contract law&mdash;that is under proposed section 56-4. I put it to you that that is a very clumsy way of going round a mechanism needed to look at disputes which are not likely to be major ones, but which can be very distressing and very troubling for an aged person needing care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What would seem to have to happen if an aged person wanted to get relief under proposed section 56-4 would be that he or she would have to go off to a court of law and get a ruling as to whether the agreement supports the particular resolution mechanism
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that is set up. If the court says it does, then he or she would have to take action to enforce the requirements that lay upon that complaints resolution mechanism and to enforce provisions such as one that guarantees quality. How is quality to be judged? That would be for the court to decide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in trying to pursue a good idea&mdash;that is, trying to pursue what is, no doubt, meant to be an informal complaints resolution mechanism&mdash;the means available to get that mechanism operating properly could well be very clumsy. I was wondering why the government has chosen to go the way of contract law to enforce this very good idea.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will look at the two avenues of complaint that could be pursued. In relation to the internal complaints system, we are looking at something which I think is in place at the moment&mdash;that is, a residents' committee working with the provider to sort out complaints by residents dealing with things like the food, the supply of services or something of that sort. The amendments now before the Senate deal with something in a little more formal sense&mdash;that is, the complaint to a committee as to the provision of subsidies, the provider cutting off the supply of electricity or something of a more serious nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would not envisage that the residents would be finding themselves having to go to  the court to work out whether their agreement with the provider gave rise to the ability for the complaints to be resolved in the way that is mentioned. I think that the internal mechanism is meant to be a much more informal process dealing with day-to-day matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The external process, if you like, which is dealt with in these amendments, is the more formal one where a resident goes to the committee and says, `This provider is just not providing me with any gas for my heater,' or, `I'm not getting the subsidy I want.' That is how the government looked at it. It wanted to provide in the first instance an informal approach for the more minor matters. Perhaps
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5239"> the more major matters would then go to a committee of the sort we are looking at in these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Law Reform Commission in reviewing aged care legislation in 1995 found that residents and older people were nervous about legal contracts. It found that very few nursing home residents had elected to sign a standard form of agreement provided for under the National Health Act 1953. I think that is understandable. What the government was trying to steer away from in this instance was having a very formal process within the facility for complaints. That is provided for more in this committee that we are dealing with which is the subject of these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So those are the two different approaches, if you like, to this. I might add that what you have in proposed section 2&hyphen;1(1)(b), to ensure a high quality standard of care&mdash;and Senator Cooney referred to this&mdash;is the question of compliance by the provider. That goes right to accreditation and that is a more formidable remedy than perhaps going off to the court seeking damages. The residents in these facilities do not really want to seek damages; they just want to fix the problem and get on with their lives.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not pursue this matter after this intervention. I can follow all that, and it seems to me that the attempt to get an informal way of getting over disputes is an attempt that should be made, but I am just wondering whether it is an attempt that is well carried out here. If you add government amendment 2 to clause 56&hyphen;4 on page 218, you get subclause (e), which says that the approved provider must:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . comply with any determination made, in respect of the approved provider, by a committee of the kind referred to in subsection 96-3(1A)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which is the second means that is available to an aged care person to get relief. I am just wondering why, if this is to be an informal mechanism in clause 56&hyphen;4, the government wants to make that amendment? In all the circumstances, would it not be better to let clause 56&hyphen;4 stand on its own and make it quite clear that that is the more formal way of going about things, and that this is the more
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> informal way? That is the first issue I want to raise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue is that I agree that legal contracts are a worrying thing, not only for aged persons but for all sorts of people&mdash;people do not want to go and sue on contracts and be sued on contracts. That being so, why in clause 56&hyphen;4 are proposed subsections 2 and 3 put in which say, `Yes, the care recipients and the approved provider must enter into contracts'? Would it not be better to leave 2 and 3 aside?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can see Senator Cooney's point. We are looking at the more informal process internally and the more formal process externally, and the parliamentary draftsman has chosen to include this amendment within clause 56&hyphen;4, which deals with complaints resolution mechanisms. Clause 56&hyphen;4, subclause (1) would tend to deal with the informal process, and what the draftsman has done is, in (e), to put in the more formal process dealing with the external. So what you have got is a mixing&hyphen;up of the informal with the more formal process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I dare say that could have been put elsewhere in the bill but that (e) is not referring to the more informal process, because in (e) it mentions the committee referred to in 96&hyphen;3.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to follow on from that comment by the parliamentary secretary. I was going to ask a question that does relate to amendment 3 as well, but if we consider the issue now it might save a bit of time later. I refer to the provisions that are inserted by amendment 2&mdash;that there must be compliance with a determination made by the committee established under proposed subsection 96&hyphen;3(1A). Why is it that that will operate, but no
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5240"> similar compliance will be required in respect of any other determinations or decisions that may be made by other committees that may be established under 96&hyphen;3?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leads to the further issue that, whilst you have talked about formal and informal and so on, the way in which the amendments are structured is that this type of committee is going to be established pursuant to 96&hyphen;3, which is the power whereby the minister can establish committees for the purpose of the act&mdash;so it is somewhat wide&hyphen;ranging. But it is only in respect of determinations of a committee established under (1A) where the legislation specifically will require compliance. That leaves at least open the issue of why should it not apply to determinations of any other committees that the minister may establish pursuant to proposed section 96&hyphen;3?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to Senator Forshaw's question, there is only one committee at this stage being set up, and that is the complaints resolution committee. We would have to do it on an ad hoc basis, if you like, to see whether the committee that is set up from time to time does need to have this power of having the compliance with its determination being bestowed upon it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I would say is: `Let us deal with each case in turn where a committee is set up.' This is a committee that clearly needs to have that power if it is to benefit the resident, but there may be other committees that are set up that just do not need this power. That is why we only have this one committee, and that is why we refer to it and give it this power.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not take the opportunity today to speak on the report because of the program, Senator Forshaw, but I will take the opportunity tonight as it is still very much a current matter. Please let me outline why the government members of the committee felt it necessary to dissent from this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5242">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole report on private funding in public schools was largely a political stunt by the ALP. Senator Carr was particularly transparent, as usual, in his misplaced, prejudiced vendetta in relation to the Victorian government on this matter&mdash;as he is on many other matters relating to education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The objective of the opposition members was to make very negative and alarmist recommendations with regard to private funding in public schools. The opposition stacked the witness list with groups that were totally opposed to private and commercial funding in state schools. They were intellectually dishonest in making recommendations which, if you read the report very carefully, are largely based on just hearsay evidence. Once of the things they did with this hearsay evidence was to tend to overstate the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nowhere in the report, because of a lack of real, hard evidence, is there any idea of the scale of the problems they were alluding to or to the extent of it through the system. We had just a whole series of anecdotes from groups in the communities who had an axe to grind about this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the first claims made by the opposition members in this report is that across Australia governments are abrogating their responsibility for providing free and public education. This is not supported by the evidence. Quite contrary to this, they have used the evidence in a very misleading way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the few bits of hard evidence that is contained in this report relates to the ABS figures on government funding in public schools. What this reveals is that total outlays in 1988&hyphen;89 were $6.6 billion and that in 1994&hyphen;95 the outlays increased to $8.4 billion. Increases were also registered for Commonwealth and state recurrent funding, with the average increase over five years from 1988 to 1994 being eight per cent in total outlay to government students. These are all price deflated figures comparing dollar with dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor have misused figures in the report and have tried to back up their claim by using per student figures. These sorts of things are most misleading, because what it does not take account of is the changing nature of what
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is happening in education over that time. You can have changes in the demographics of education, changes in the composition of schooling, changes in the capital works programs, across schools in different states at different times, depending on the age structure of the population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the figure that they quote in support of their changes, which shows only a minuscule decline&mdash;less than one per cent&mdash;has all these rather interesting assumptions behind it. We believe the figure we have used, which is real increases in spending on public education over time, is a much better way to measure it. The lack of evidence is finally conceded at one point buried in the middle of the report. What it says sums up what I have just been saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is extremely difficult to ascertain where the truth lies in matters of State and Territory Government expenditure on services, especially when the involvement of the Commonwealth is taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What the opposition report says here is that basically they do not know. So they rely on a considerable amount of anecdotal evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They rely on this to talk about the way in which governments should be delivering total funding, they claim, to cover what they call the eight key learning areas. Tying it to a specific framework like this at this point in time&mdash;next year it might be nine key learning areas; these things change over time&mdash;is a bit foolish. But the whole concept of getting taxpayers to fund all of this is seen as being totally unrealistic even by the school principals. I quote the school principals:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This principals' organisation believes that it is completely unrealistic to expect governments to come up with the level of funding which would be required to provide every item seen as desirable.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We also reject the opposition's majority report alleging problems with the level of private and commercial funding in schools. Labor has tried very hard in this report to create the impression that problems associated with private and commercial funding are recent. They further claim that these trends are linked with recent policies which favour privatisation and commercialisation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5243">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if you go back not too far in history to the time of the Schools Commission in 1984&mdash;so we are going back 13 years&mdash;it actually gives the lie to that being an issue. It has not suddenly come up as an issue because we have coalition governments around the country. In 1984, you might recall, we had Labor governments right around the country, when the Schools Commission reported that they saw private and commercial funding in government schools as being a perceived problem. It is certainly not recent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subject levies is another thing that the report complains about. Opposition senators are trying to make out that that again is a recent thing and part of this user&hyphen;pays philosophy. But things such as subject levies, fees and voluntary contributions have always been part of education. There is no evidence&mdash;despite Senator Crowley quoting a certain amount of anecdotal evidence&mdash;that this has influenced subject choice, that students have been humiliated on a widespread scale or that students have been kept away from excursions and other activities. Obviously, these things may have happened in isolated cases, but again there is no hard evidence that this is extensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the report also leaves out is the considerable amount of assistance that is provided by governments to students in difficulty. There is no mention of Austudy, no mention of Abstudy, no mention of programs in South Australia&mdash;Senator Ferris, you will be pleased to know that we were quite impressed with the school card program in South Australia&mdash;where public funding is available for parents who have trouble paying fees and levies. That is the sort of approach which has been in place for some time, which does give the lie to this being a particularly new and difficult problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would like also to comment on sponsorships in schools. There was not much attention to this in the report, but I want to finish by briefly commenting on that. We do share some of the concerns that there could be exploitation of students stemming from sponsorship in schools, but we feel that this can be adequately handled by having arrangements and very tight guidelines centrally and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> also at the school level. Education and ethical matters can therefore be handled in  this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to point out, as the major opposition report did not point out, that there are enormous benefits to education from proper sponsorship arrangements. Businesses are increasingly becoming involved in not for profit activities. Businesses have a growing sense of social responsibility. We recommend that, as long as schools follow guidelines, limits should not be placed on their entrepreneurial activities by government, and Labor and the minor parties have not made out their case for their majority report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a base political exercise and it has been a waste of time. There is not a major problem in this country with private and commercial funding. It is not the bogey that the opposition points out. I would encourage this government to examine the government senators' report as an appropriate response to the private funding that exists in public schools.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5243"><TITLE>International Garden Festival</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to speak about an issue that is of fairly major importance; in fact, I would say it is presently the most important issue on the Central Coast: the issue of the international garden festival and the failure of the federal government to give it due and proper support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This project has had an extraordinarily long history and has had its ups and downs but we on the Central Coast were lucky enough for it to start to take shape late last year. But, because of the failure of the federal government to give its commitment, it has not proceeded in the way we would have hoped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not wish to go over every nuance of the project, but I would like to say that it has  been going for a very long time. I would like to give some recognition to Barry Cohen, a former minister for tourism in the previous government, who originally came up with the idea. In saying that, I would point out that he is not the only person who has made a contribution to this project, which has very broad and fundamental community support.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5244">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The project had been around in an earlier form. A request had been put to both the state and the federal governments to provide a sum in the range of $180 million towards the project in order to get it off the ground. Due to the financial circumstances and the way projects tend to be undertaken these days, this was not a viable project. So a group of community&hyphen;based people went back to the drawing board and put together another feasibility study based on a project that was going to be entirely privately funded, except for relatively minor contributions from the state and federal governments. The project was re&hyphen;launched last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As someone who was intimately involved in the whole process and who served on the organising committee&mdash;along with a large number of other people, including the Mayor of Gosford, Tony Sansom; Keith Dedden, who has become the CEO of the project and is a former general manager of Gosford Council; members of the chamber of commerce; and others from the university at Lisarow&mdash;I would have to say that we put together a project that we really thought had legs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to say that Jim Lloyd was not involved in that organising committee. I will not detract from anything he may have done but I cannot say he was a member of the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of what occurred last year, having had a revised feasibility study done on the basis that the private sector would underwrite and develop the project, a proposition was put to the state government that they would contribute by providing the land at Mount Penang&mdash;land valued at somewhere between $15 million and $20 million. It was also proposed that we would seek a similar contribution from the federal government and, with those two contributions, the project could get off the ground. The ultimate result was to be a major international event, employing in a general sense about 16,000 people, to be launched on the Central Coast. You can imagine that, in an area where there is a reasonably high level of unemployment and where those who are employed often com
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mute to Sydney, this was an extraordinarily popular proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A letter was sent by the state government to the federal government indicating its support for the project and suggesting that the federal government might like to throw in an equal amount&mdash;a sum of $300,000&mdash;as seed funding to the state government. The state government intended to donate the land for the project. The response of the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, was that once a private sector developer and underwriter were secured, he would provide a contribution `consistent with normal responsibilities for such events'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In questioning during estimates, a Mr Maxted from the Office of National Tourism indicated that the normal national responsibility for these sorts of festivals was an Australian pavilion, a commissioner&hyphen;general for the event, quarantine and customs services and the lodgment of the application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister indicated that the federal government would be prepared to contribute in this way if a private underwriter was secured. After a great deal of work by the community representatives and the CEO of the project, a preferred tenderer was secured&mdash;a fairly major construction company, Thiess. A letter was then sent to Mr Howard asking for the application to be lodged with the BIE and asking for the intended contribution to be confirmed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just seven days before the final date for the lodgement of that application, Mr Howard wrote back saying that the provision of a private developer and underwriter was insufficient and that they required not only that but also the underwriting by the New South Wales government. I have to say that it seems to me to be rather extraordinary that this government sing the praises of private industry and private sector involvement and private finance but, when it actually comes down to involving themselves in a project and providing support, they would not accept the underwriting of a major construction company with a balance sheet in the billions of dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was some suggestion put that, because a similar situation existed with Queens
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5245"> land and the Queensland government was prepared to underwrite the project, the New South Wales government should as well. There was a major difference between the two projects which the federal government failed to acknowledge. That was that the Queensland project was established, set up and put forward by the state government, while this particular project was nurtured, created, dreamed up and promoted by a group of community based people who really just wanted to see something good done for the central coast and the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some rather interesting issues that have arisen as a result of all this. I must confess that I am not one who is prone to conspiracy theories, but the whole support and approval provided to the Queensland government for their project was well in excess of the support and encouragement provided to the central coast project. I must confess that I was somewhat concerned by an indication that&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="B36">Senator NEAL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Though the Commonwealth government could not see fit to attend the BIE and support the central coast project; they attended and put forward a proposition that the Queensland project should be supported. They also put forward a proposition that the moratorium that had existed, which would have been a bar to the Queensland garden festival proceeding in the year 2002, should be lifted. The reason this moratorium had been in place was that there have been too many international events and too many garden festivals around. In fact, this was put in place to prevent a further proliferation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say I wish to draw no sinister conclusions from this set of events. But the fact is that, if an event were not to occur in the year 2000 in New South Wales, it would be a major boost for the Queensland government in arguing that the moratorium should be lifted and that the Queensland international garden festival would not be the second Australian event in two years but, in fact, would be the first in many years in Australia.

I must say that Mount Gambier&mdash;as it always has been whenever I visited there&mdash;impresses one. It is a most impressive area. It is an area of great beauty, an area of innovative industry. As I drew attention to the fact before, with that innovation, the timber industry certainly is near the top.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say to the government that I think there is a very urgent need to upgrade and restore the rail services to that area. That is why I must say that the government's quite shameful pushing through of the legislation really gave no guarantees whatsoever to the future of the rail industry in the southern states the other day. One of the reasons why I am disappointed at what happened is that this is an area where the restoration of rail services is urgently needed but not likely to happen.</PARA>

Senator Ferris could probably confirm it, but I would assume it is probably the second most closely settled area in South Australia.

Let us never forget that we inherited in this place a deficit of $10.5 billion, but in our first term of office we will have turned this into a surplus of $1.6 billion. By any measure, that is a dramatic turnaround&mdash;without raising income tax, company tax, wholesale sales tax or petrol excise. It is a significant achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to have a look at some of these achievements. The list is extensive and very significant. Most importantly, there is the $1 billion family tax package providing a billion dollars of tax relief for thousands of people who voted for our policies. That is $200 per child and $500 for single income qualifying families all delivered in full on 1 January.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Neal, there is no L&hyphen;A&hyphen;W on this side of the chamber. We have delivered the lowest interest rates in 30 years and families have benefited by an average of $293 every month on an average $100,000 loan. That is a long way from the crippling interest rates imposed on families by those opposite. Importantly, we are encouraging Australians to save some of these extra earnings by providing a universal tax rebate on savings&mdash;a 15 per cent rebate on up to $3,000 of savings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second, and very significant cornerstone, was our industrial relations reform which took effect on 1 January and encourages employers and employees to make their own working arrangements free of coercion and compulsion and to have a real choice at last. We have given a boost to small business&mdash;exempting them from unfair dismissal laws if they employ fewer than 15 people and abolishing the fringe benefits tax on car parking and taxi travel to and from work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have continued the well&hyphen;established program of privatisation begun by those across the chamber by preparing for the sale of one-third of Telstra. This has enabled the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5247"> establishment of the $1.25 billion Natural Heritage Trust which guarantees long-term benefits to our environment and surely one of the most important benefits that we can offer to our wealth generating industries in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as that, we are trying to clean up the absolutely unworkable Native Title Act which was a clumsy attempt to satisfy special interest groups and eventually satisfied none except the lawyers&mdash;and plenty of them. Our amendments will provide certainty and fairness to Australian pastoralists and to Aboriginal communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are more significant changes which will come into effect next Tuesday. Briefly I wish to highlight some of those extra reforms that will take effect next week with the beginning of the new financial year. A substantial first start will be the $290 million of capital gains tax relief to small business. This will allow small business to reinvest in another business without incurring capital gains tax&mdash;a very  important incentive to this huge group of employers. Then there are the tax incentives for private health insurance worth up to $450 a family or $125 for singles available from next week and Medicare retained as promised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the one&hyphen;stop shop approach to more efficient employment opportunities, apprenticeships and traineeships and the superannuation reforms which will allow a contributing spouse to receive an 18 per cent rebate for contributions up to $3,000 for a low income spouse. That is a very important policy initiative. From 1 July the carer's pension will increase to 52 the number of days within a year a carer may temporarily cease caring without affecting their payments. We are doubling the hours per week that carers may spend in employment. Legislation for a more competitive telecommunications regime will also come into effect next Tuesday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are only halfway through our first term of government. The process of reform will continue with policies that are consistent and ambitious. This year we will repay another $5 billion of the debt left by those opposite and the following year we will repay another $5
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> billion and so on until the year 2000 when the debt left to us will have been halved&mdash;not a bad effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has accepted the responsibility to open up the tax system to make it a better and fairer system. We will not be heading for the trenches at the first whiff of grapeshot from those across the chamber. So this government is starting to clean up Labor's mess, to climb the Mount Everest of the problems they left behind. Most importantly, all Australians will be the beneficiaries of these changes and, equally importantly, we will never stop listening to them.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5247"><TITLE>One Nation Party</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week Senator Boswell gave what I believe to be a landmark speech in this chamber in which he showed honourable senators links between the One Nation Party and groups of extremists in Queensland and elsewhere around the country. I now wish to take the opportunity to bring to the further attention of the Senate some of the nefarious infiltration of the One Nation Party by groups of extremists. I start in Hervey Bay where a man well known to members of parliament from Queensland, Mr Tony Pitt, resides.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Pitt has a long history of being associated with extremist causes. He is now the secretary of the Hervey Bay branch of the One Nation Party. His wife is the secretary of the Maryborough branch of the One Nation Party. Quite recently, he was one of the organisers for a series of meetings for the One Nation Party in the Hervey Bay area. Why then, honourable senators may ask, was the same Mr Pitt the author of an open letter of 2 May in the notorious <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lock, stock and barrel</EMPHASIS> magazine, in which Mr Pitt described himself as the national chairman of a political party called The Australians?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just so that honourable senators have some idea of the ramblings of Mr Pitt I will only read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a short bit. I am happy to table the whole thing. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A few hundred miles north, there are a million soldiers who would gang rape a girl, then cut off her breasts, and chatter and laugh like monkeys as she then ran blindly in terror, pain and shock, past oppressed locals who were
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5248"> too scared to help or even look at her out of fear that they would suffer similarly if they were to intervene.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Pitt, in edition No. 26 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lock, stock and barrel</EMPHASIS> , in fact advertises for the political party called The Australians. He describes the party as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australians are different. The party believes that candidates should be independent and represent the electorate. The state elements of the party are also independent in a voluntary alliance to achieve the broad aims set out above. Minor differences of opinions and aims are to be expected, tolerated, even encouraged. There are 270 pro&hyphen;freedom organisations working to save Australia. In the past they have been too independent to even work together. This disarray has kept crooked politicians on seats in Canberra. Let us co&hyphen;operate and end their reign.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It gives a series of contacts for this party The Australians in different states. As I said, the Queensland contact is none other than Mr Tony Pitt, whose address is 79 Ferry Street, Maryborough. My office has made some inquiries of some of the other contacts, Mr Acting Deputy President, and this may interest you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contact in South Australia is a Mr Algie Walker, whose phone number is identified as is his postal address. He advised my office that he has joined the One Nation Party. So my office then contacted somebody in Western Australia, a Mr Allan Rossiter, who is listed as the contact for The Australians in Western Australia. He advised that the party members have all gone and joined One Nation and in fact have donated their money to One Nation. So it is quite clear that One Nation is not the voice of mainstream ordinary Australia; One Nation is now just a front for this extremist group called The Australians. They have infiltrated its branch network. They are the organisers of these functions and they are taking decent and well&hyphen;meaning Australians for a ride into political oblivion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Pitt's activities are well known in Queensland as are those of his friends, for example, Mr Ron Owen. Mr Owen is a well&hyphen;known associate of Mr Pitt and is a publisher of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lock, stock and barrel</EMPHASIS> magazine in which Mr Pitt is a frequent advertiser and to which he wrote the open letter of 2 May, to which I have referred. Honourable senators and others might be interested to know that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Mr Owen was recently fined for offences in Queensland relating to the sale of banned copies of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lock, stock and barrel</EMPHASIS> magazine in 1993. Why were these four issues of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lock, stock and barrel</EMPHASIS> banned by the Office of Film and Literature Classification? Let me tell you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This magazine was banned because it gave instructions to tell Australians how to convert a rifle into a machine&hyphen;gun. Another copy of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lock, stock and barrel</EMPHASIS> magazine contained an article entitled `Pyrotechnics in the kitchen'. This article told Australians how to manufacture two&hyphen;part explosives. The purpose of manufacturing a two&hyphen;part explosive was specifically stated to kill police officers. The explosion would go off in two parts: the first part would kill a police dog and the second part would kill the handler as he went to the assistance of the dog.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the people who are now infiltrating Mrs Hanson's party through The Australians, through people like Mr Pitt, through his active involvement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lock, stock and barrel</EMPHASIS> magazine. I think many of the Australians who have unwittingly signed up to One Nation would be horrified to know that they are keeping the company of extremists who advocate the making of explosives to kill police officers. I think many of these decent Australians would be horrified to find that they keep the company of foul&hyphen;mouthed individuals like Mr Pitt, whose obscenities are reprinted on a regular basis in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lock, stock and barrel</EMPHASIS> magazine. But when they join One Nation they join people like this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One Nation is not about giving a voice to the aspirations of oppressed and undertrodden Australians. One Nation is merely a front for extremist organisations who wish to peddle their own form of conspiracy, paranoia and hatred. I do not believe that there are any decent people in this country who really want to see explosives manufactured to kill police officers, who really want to see people manufacturing machine guns in their home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People like Mr Pitt and Mr Owen seem to think this is fit and proper to be published. The Office of Film and Literature Classification disagreed. Mr Owen has been taken
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5249"> through the courts in Queensland. He was fined $1,500 when the matter came up for court last year. But these people continue to infiltrate the organisation.

The statement that processing the spent fuel rods would involve significantly lower levels of radioactivity than those already associated with ANSTO's current radio&hyphen;pharmaceutical production is based on calculations by ANSTO that radio&hyphen;pharmaceutical production on site involves processing 30kg of irradiated uranium containing 1017  Becquerels of radioactivity each year, while processing one hundred spent fuel rods a year would involve only some 14kg of irradiated

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) See answer to 1. The Government does not have under consideration the building of a commercial scale facility anywhere in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The recent OECD publication, `The NEA Co&hyphen;operative Program on Decommissioning&mdash;The First Ten Years 1985&hyphen;95', lists three irradiated uranium processing facilities that have been decommissioned and completely decontaminated, and a number of others are in various stages of decommissioning. The three completed decommissioning operations are the AT&hyphen;1 reprocessing plant in France, the BNFL Co&hyphen;Precipitation Plant in the UK and the Tunneys Pasture Facility in Canada.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The Synroc business plan is a Commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;Confidence document which I am not at liberty to disclose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Should the Government choose the processing option, the proposal would undergo environmental assessment in accordance with the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) ACT 1974. Under this process various details on the Synroc project would become available to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) It would be premature for ANSTO to discuss a proposal for siting a reprocessing facility at Lucas Heights before the Government has given the matter its due consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) Yes, consideration has been given to developing a Synroc plant overseas. For example, ANSTO has held discussions with UK, French and US organisations active in waste remediation; details of these discussions are, however, commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence.</PARA>
