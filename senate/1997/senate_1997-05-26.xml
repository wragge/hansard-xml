<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The AIDC Sale Bill 1997 was introduced into the House of Representatives on 22 February and makes the legislative amendments to enable the sale of the Australian Industry Development Corporation, known as the AIDC. Labor will not oppose the bill, despite having concerns with the legislation as it relates to the AIDC shareholding in the Australian Submarine Corporation and with the employment terms and conditions of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> staff&mdash;although our concerns in this area have, to some extent, been alleviated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AIDC was established in 1970 as an investment bank to finance Australian industry. Its role, when established, was essentially to fill a gap that was not then adequately covered by the banking sector and other financial lenders. It, essentially, was established to cover cases where the development would not otherwise have taken place or would have been possible only in circumstances&mdash;unless local finance was available&mdash;that involved ownership of control going to foreign investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years, the AIDC has pioneered infrastructure financing and it has a unique capability to turn public policy into reality through reacting as a policy lever for national development. It developed widely recognised project resource and infrastructure financing expertise. Two of the many significant examples of developments which occurred with AIDC financing include the Woodside North West Shelf gas project, which involved $US1.6 billion of financing, and the Argyle Diamond project, where the AIDC was the only Australian financier. There would have been no Australian equity in it but for the AIDC. The Eraring Power Station project was also financed through the AIDC, as was the nucleus telectronics pacemaker, which AIDC underwrote the initial financing of. In addition to all of those very worthwhile and significant infrastructure investments, the AIDC has contributed some $130 million in dividend payments to the Commonwealth since 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, the AIDC has performed well. It did make a loss in 1991, but most banks reported major losses in that period. But it did not, through its difficult period, need to draw on the government guarantee. The loss occurred largely because in the mid&hyphen; to late 1980s the AIDC had moved away from its core business of infrastructure and resources. We, as a Labor Party, believe that there is still a need for activity in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AIDC currently employs some 200 people. The Labor Party does not want to see overly generous golden handshakes or, in the case of some, golden handshakes going to the AIDC's senior management. Apart from that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3520"> group, we are concerned that the ordinary workers in the organisation not be disadvantaged by the sale. I note that concerns were expressed about this during the Senate committee hearings. Labor is pleased that assurances have now been given that the existing terms and conditions of employment for these workers will be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AIDC is one of two Australian controlled and independent investment houses. There is a real chance that, through this sale, it could be purchased by overseas interests, particularly as there are no special provisions in the bill to deal with foreign ownership. Labor notes the assurances of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, that, if the buyer is overseas owned, the AIDC's 48&half; per cent holding in the Australian Submarine Corporation could be excluded from the sale. We welcome that assurance but believe we need to legislate to ensure that assurance is maintained. That is the purpose of the amendment I will be moving when we consider the detail of this bill. We will essentially be moving that the Australian Submarine Corporation component be removed from AIDC Ltd and located within the corporation, which is to stay in place under this legislative arrangement to manage the borrowings and loan portfolio and to manage such national interest assets as the Commonwealth's Australian Submarine Corporation shareholding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, the AIDC will remain in existence. It needs to manage certain activities. We are saying that this is where the Australian Submarine Corporation shareholding should be parked to ensure the guarantee, the assurance, that was given by Senator Kemp. It will also ensure that the AIDC as well as the Australian Submarine Corporation do not become foreign controlled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor recognises that, to some extent, the AIDC has moved from its original charter and that the need for capital private sector investment in major infrastructure projects, while just as significant, now needs to be addressed in different ways. The AIDC itself has  confirmed that there is no function that it now performs which cannot be carried out equally as well by the private sector.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there still remains a significant gap in the market; the AIDC is no longer specifically focused towards filling that gap. The government is doing nothing to fill this gap because it does not believe that it has a role in the area. Worse, it is cutting away all of the existing support mechanisms: the DIFF scheme, the R&amp;D tax concessions, the bounties, Austrade and AusIndustry to name a few, with a total of $3.9 billion cut out of the last budget. The export market development grant scheme is another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year the axe looks set to fall further on the Australian motor vehicle industry. We could see its demise if the government adopts the majority recommendations of the Productivity Commission. Pharmaceuticals, information technology, textiles, clothing and footwear and, once again, research and development concessions have all been under the microscope. Labor strongly opposes the huge cost cutting exercise that Treasury and this government have been involved in in wanting to zap industry and literally wipe out many of these industry sectors. We see a real need for government involvement and a real role for government involvement in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly hope&mdash;although I am not terribly sure this hope will be realised&mdash;that some on the back bench opposite understand the destruction that the Treasurer, Mr Peter Costello, is creating in terms of our manufacturing base. It is about time they backed the manufacturing industry in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Monday 17 March, Labor sought examination of the issue through the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee. It was a process which yielded some useful information, including the fact that legislation had been drafted without reference to the AIDC board. This is a great government for consultation. It said, `We are going to wipe you out, board members, but we will not tell you about it. We will keep it secret and we will drop it on you in the parliament. You can read about it in the newspapers.' It was only through the hearings we had in the Senate that the board was able to flag three problems that they had with the legislation. This is a hallmark of this government: it announces particular legislation, it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3521"> consults afterwards and then it does not listen as a consequence of that consultation. We have seen many examples of that in the Senate over the past year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless Labor had actually gone through the accountability exercise in the Senate committee we would not have known about this. The government would not have sought to ask them about these difficulties. These difficulties should have been sorted out well before the legislation was tabled. It does reflect the undue haste with which the government seems to continually introduce legislation, as well as its inability to manage the process of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has a second reading amendment with regard to this legislation. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the motion, add:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst recognising that there were difficulties associated with the way the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) had moved from its original charter, the Senate nevertheless:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reaffirms its commitment to the principles underpinning the AIDC's creation;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> condemns the Government for not putting a structure in place which addresses the failure of Australia's capital markets to provide sufficient long-term, patient funds for industry development; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> calls on the Government to establish an effective means of supporting patient capital investment and to determine remedial strategies appropriate to today's environment".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would indicate to the Senate that, in addition to that second reading amendment, in the consideration in detail stage of committee we will seek to move amendments to require that the Submarine Corporation's shares be parked in the AIDC. The purpose is to ensure that the Submarine Corporation and the activities that spin off from it, which have seen enormous leverage given to the defence systems and heavy engineering capacity of this country and the critical mass that it established and which would have not been backed by the Australian financiers but for the AIDC, are kept. They are to be kept properly through the corporation's structure and ensure that it is does not come under foreign control. I will seek the opportunity to address those details in the committee stage.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3M6">Senator MURRAY</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.45 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The AIDC was established by the Gorton Liberal government in 1970, nearly 30 years ago. It was a marvellous initiative, established by a great Australian nationalist who believed that the resources and ingenuity of Australians should result in an increase in the national income of Australians rather than that of foreign investors. Hence the AIDC was set up to help finance the development of new Australian industries and businesses. It was a great initiative in 1970 and, as the government's proposition of a venture capital fund shows, it still serves a great need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since financial deregulation in 1983 a whole range of merchant banks have been established and have thrived to the extent that it seems that any corporate raider can now obtain finance if they want it. The AIDC was acquired by the previous Labor government to compete with them and in recent years has operated basically as a merchant bank rather than as a tool of national economic development policy. Many of its current problems must be laid at the door of the previous government. Yet the original argument for setting up the AIDC is even stronger now than it ever was. In 1996, Australia's net foreign liabilities, that is debt and equity, constituted 60 per cent of gross domestic product, up from 42 per cent of GDP a decade ago and 20 per cent a decade before that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last decade, net foreign equity investment in Australia has more than doubled, from 9.5 to 20 per cent of GDP. Income payable on those investments, on debt and equity, constitutes virtually all of our $20 billion annual current account deficit. No other OECD country has a current account deficit problem comparable to Australia's, stemming from the failure to finance our own investments domestically. Indeed, it is quite clear that there is a continuing need for a  national investment bank with the objective of raising our national income and our economic independence. An AIDC committed to the national interest would fulfil this role. But the AIDC as it is presently structured cannot. It is just a merchant bank, a merchant bank 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3522"> trading off its government guarantee to borrow cheap and lend dear. That is hardly the sort of business that a government instrumentality should be in, and we would like to see it return to its original charter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a while the AIDC seemed to become a law unto itself. The accountability regime established by the previous government simply did not work. Former AIDC executives awarded themselves huge wage rises. In 1995, four AIDC executives had packages of over $1 million. Another six were paid over $700,000, well above the market rate even for moderately successful merchant bankers. All of this was done, often with the government appointed member of the board excluded from board meetings or prevented from reporting back to government what was going on, even though such payments seriously affected the AIDC dividend to government. I note with approval that AIDC salaries have since been substantially reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe that the Australian Industry Development Corporation should remain in public ownership. But we believe that its subsidiary, the AIDC Ltd, the corporate subsidiary, should be sold or wound up and its assets transferred back to AIDC the corporation, or there should be a combination of both sale of AIDC Ltd and assets transfer. The corporation should be then given a clear national interest agenda, with a particular focus on small business development, industry development and regional development and then set out to fill the holes in our financial sector and the provision of cheap and accessible finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill does not achieve that. It does not attempt to achieve that. It merely allows AIDC Ltd to be sold. As a trade sale it is likely to be to another merchant bank or a foreign bank. That will hardly deepen or broaden our financial sector. It will not address the problems that I have outlined and which were also outlined by Labor earlier. It will certainly do nothing to improve our economic independence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the fact that many of the problems that the AIDC experiences can be laid at Labor's door, we will be supporting Labor's second reading amendment. But we do intend 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to let the government bill go through with our support, subject to an amendment which we will be putting to clear up some of the areas where there are problems. Those I will address during the committee stage.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="3522" TIME="12.50 p.m." SPEAKER="Margetts, Sen Dee" NAMEID="DX5" ELECTORATE="WA" PARTY="G(WA)" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.50 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sale of the AIDC has been on the cards for some time. We will not oppose this measure, in spite of our general view that the public sector representing the public interest has a place in direct market activity and indeed to retain control through public monopoly critical sectors of the economy. The reason we do not oppose the sale is that AIDC has not, in our opinion, done much of anything to actually stimulate industry. Various specific sectoral industry policies have been much more important. In fact, the AIDC has been used to stimulate some quite dubious sectors of the economy, for example the defence industries and defence trade, in what amounts to subsidies for those industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AIDC is, as honourable senators probably know, the minority shareholder in Australian Submarine Corporation. About one&hyphen;eighth of AIDC's capital is tied to the Australian Submarine Corporation, giving it 49 per cent shareholding, enough to give Kockums, the Swedish submarine company, which is the other direct partner in AIDC, controlling interest without expending a cent more than is required. So AIDC is doing great things in terms of benefiting submarine manufacturing here and corporate profits in Sweden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the $100 million invested in companies not wholly owned, about $26 million or one quarter is with Australian Submarine Corporation and $20 million each with Textile Industries Australia and Venture Stores Ltd, respectively a textile manufacturer and a chain of retail stores. About $10 million is with appliance manufacturer Kambrook and other minor amounts are with other manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I personally do not see how we are greatly benefiting industry development in Australia with this sort of investment profile. We are benefiting indefensible defence policy for subsidising defence industries. We are benefiting Kambrook a little and the manchester 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3523"> industry, which would potentially help electrical goods manufacturing and textile production, but I am not sure who we are meant to be benefiting in investing in Venture Stores, a retail chain. It does not seem to me that there is a shortage of retail stores or that industry will grow as a result of such investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that AIDC divested its investment in Berrivale Orchards a few years ago. I think it was at about the same time fruit juice manufacturers were complaining about the impact of the World Trade Organisation bills on the Australian fruit juice industry generally and the citrus industry specifically. Perhaps that was a bit embarrassing. At least some of the investments in wholly owned companies, about $200 million worth, have also been of questionable benefit in terms of industry policy. Investment includes items like International Parking (Liverpool) Pty Ltd and the China Water Company (Hacaing) Ltd. Also, a lot of investments are in bonds and other speculative areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a business, AIDC has not done badly. It has returned profit to the Commonwealth. Our objection previously was based on an objection of the AIDC itself that the mechanism for sale would devalue the company and the problems associated with the repurchase of stock issued on the basis that AIDC would not be sold. At this point, however, AIDC seems to feel content with the sale plan. So there is no real objection to its going ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the absence of any clear national interest agenda, I would like to point out, though, where in our opinion AIDC has, through government policy changes, missed the mark. AIDC was established as a vehicle for investment in the pursuit of industry policy. I believe the pursuit of industry policy is still a valid goal. I would love to see this government  make a commitment to industry development&mdash;particularly the development of a manufacturing sector in Australia. We badly need value added industry, and it is clear that the corporate boardrooms globally do not currently see Australia as a source of manufactured goods. The global corporate map has Australia pencilled in as a provider of cheap minerals, wheat, wool and woodchip, and a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consumer of manufactured products of all sorts, including, ironically, various kinds of foodstuffs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of noise has been made in this parliament and academia about the wonders of the Asian economies. It is time we took a real look at what they did. They did not grow by lowering all barriers to imports and foreign investment. They did not grow by severing government involvement in the market and `allowing the market the freedom to develop and thrive'. They kept shelters whilst stimulating their own development through strong, directed investment policies and through direct support for what they considered key industries. They did not simply accept the wisdom of corporate heads and major Western economies. They did not allow themselves to be producers of cheap labour products and primary produce, and consumers of their ex-imperial masters' manufactured goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Asian governments actively promoted and developed manufacturing, secondary industry, particularly in the areas of import replacement and value adding. They adopted the highest technological means of production available, produced at the highest technological level that their infrastructure could support and actively sought to increase the level of their infrastructure. This is why China is now producing televisions, electronic goods and, increasingly, computer hardware and software. This is why countries like Taiwan have virtually turned away from low labour cost goods. They do not want their position to be dependent on the poverty of their people. They have aspirations for more than that and as a nation they have been willing to act, through government, to pursue such goals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here in Australia we seem to have the opposite aspiration. Government seems to be determined to impoverish people and ensure that a low wage regime will come into play. That is why they do nothing about employment, why there is no investment policy, why there is no industry policy and why they are dismantling industrial relations law as a mechanism to protect workers and turning it into a mechanism to ensure their exploitation. This is why they are dismantling the social support structure under the guise of economic 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3524"> necessity. This is why we see a work for the dole scheme and a move to user&hyphen;pays and lower taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is here for the corporations and the rich. It is involved in major redistribution of wealth&mdash;upwards, from the mouths of workers and those struggling outside the work force. And make no mistake: if there is any area of waste, it lies in the corporate excesses for the upper management. It lies in the lives of the wealthy in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No, this government is selling Australia down the river. Its idea of development is to mine uranium in a world heritage area. Its idea of development is to give a green light to loggers to decimate the few remaining pockets of old&hyphen;growth forest to turn it into woodchips. It would not even rate for being turned into disposable chopsticks; it will be ground into little pieces. This government is determined to turn wealth into dross.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's only excuse is the so-called international free market. Attitude is not policy, despite what they say on soft drink commercials. What we need for effective development is a commitment to doing what we need to do to create a world we all wish to live in&mdash;a radical concept&mdash;one where no-one is in great economic hardship and one that supports community and supports life with a capital `L', the beauty of our natural heritage and the integrity of an ecosystem that makes all our lives possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need positive industry and investment policy, but we need more than that. We need policies of vision, policies that include the future, where development gives more than incidental thought to the long-term state of the earth and our local environment. We need policies for the development of technologies that have positive physical and social effects, policies that take an integrated approach to the future, policies that include at all levels the need to address issues like the greenhouse effect&mdash;remember that?&mdash;and the ultimate well-being of our water and land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need socially oriented development. We need development that will create a more equitable and diverse society; policies that create full employment under benign conditions&mdash;not policies that encourage 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> overwork, insecurity, and breakdown of familial and social relationships. We absolutely do not need divisive policies that pit parts of our community against others, against Aboriginals or migrants&mdash;yet that seems to be the direction this government has chosen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The term `sustainable development', almost since its coining, has been raised whenever people call for protection of nature. It is time to call for the protection of nature and for social welfare to be considered whenever we talk about development. I believe the funds from this sale should be used in this fashion. I will not be holding my breath. Nevertheless, we will be supporting this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the AIDC Sale Bill is to privatise the Australian Industry Development Corporation Ltd, the AIDC, in line with other government announcements with regard to asset sales&mdash;namely, the airports and ANL, the Australian National Line&mdash;which will reap billions of dollars for budget repair. I know the other speakers in essence are supporting this bill, but they were giving false sentiment to the AIDC as it is about to be auctioned off. It is always a sentiment you can give and have the luxury of when in opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have to say that particularly the Australian Democrat speaker gave the best case of exactly why it should be sold, and that is that it is no longer acting in its original role. Its lending is now no longer at favourable rates&mdash;they are indeed at market rates&mdash;and therefore its profits are very slim indeed. Without the government guarantee, it can be said that it would be making massive losses. So the government guaran tee is all that is holding up this particular organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Added to that was the great credibility loss of this organisation when it increased executive salaries to the tune of a million dollars. This is just a relatively small merchant bank and the executives&mdash;they were given this pay rise under the previous government, of course&mdash;were paying themselves an amount equivalent to that earned by Don Argus or Don Mercer from the National Australia Bank and the ANZ Bank. So I feel that the organisation lost a great deal of credibility and the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3525"> right to any sentiment that it may get from the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is worth looking at the organisation's history from whence it began because it is in fact entrenched in National Party history, Senator Sherry, which you fail to give due credit to. The library digest gives us the source. The AIDC was established in 1970 and it was mainly the initiative of the Rt Hon. John `Black Jack' McEwen, who was then minister for trade and industry.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WH4">Senator McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sherry, you interject in relation to `Black Jack' McEwen. The trade portfolio has been held by the National Party since time immemorial and it is still held in this coalition government by the Leader of the National Party and Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, who is overseas at this very moment progressing Australia's position. The then minister for trade, Jack McEwen, saw the need to counter Australia's growing dependence on foreign capital to support its enterprises and industries. At a time of its creation in 1970, the AIDC was the only merchant bank in the country. It was set up as a state owned merchant bank to provide capital in mining, manufacturing, processing and resource development sectors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">McEwen was not opposed to foreign investment per se and in fact he acknowledged the importance of the availability of such capital to Australia, as it is today. The AIDC was created to fill a gap then not adequately covered by the banking sector and other financial lenders. It assisted Australian residents to match the share capital required to create or maintain large enterprises so as to avoid too often becoming the minor party in an enterprise which was the target of foreign investment or a takeover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since its origins, the Australian financial sector has grown to an extent where there is a multitude of merchant banks and financial institutions accommodating particularly the sectors that the AIDC was particularly interested in or targeted, and they were the mining and manufacturing sectors. I doubt whether the Rt Hon. Black Jack McEwen would have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> imagined the deregulated economy that we have today, the deregulated financial sector and all the options now open to Australian business. I think he would have understood, would have accepted and would have wanted the sale of the AIDC. The fact is that it has run its course. It no longer the relevancy or usefulness that it did have&mdash;and it certainly did have&mdash;at its establishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Its sale now very much fits this coalition government's privatisation program and debt reduction strategy. The sale is generally supported by the opposition. However, the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee reports that there was some discussion with regard to the disposal of the AIDC interest in the Australian Submarine Corporation Pty Ltd, of which the AIDC holds some 48.5 per cent. That is a genuine concern and not inappropriate, but it is one that has been understood by this government and has been dealt with. I quote the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is not the government's intention and, clearly, if there was a potential problem in that area, (the Commonwealth's shareholding in ASC) would be pulled out of the sale.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Just to restate that: there is a proper concern that, when the AIDC is sold, inappropriate foreign investors may take up the AIDC's 48 per cent share of the submarine corporation. But, as that quote says, the government is aware of this and would not allow inappropriate foreign ownership of that particular corporation. Therefore, this bill enables the Minister for Finance to remove any asset from AIDC Ltd and invest it elsewhere. So we have that open option, Senator Margetts. It is important to note that, with the sale of the AIDC, any government asset and funds received will go towards government debt reduction. This is in stark contrast to the privatisation program of the previous Labor government, which wasted billions of dollars of asset sales in recurrent expenditure.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3526"> through this speech. It is really not worth interjecting, given that I am so far over here on the back bench and you are way over there on the front bench. Why don't you just hold your tongue? Save your energies for question time or something a little more appropriate for one of the heavyweights over there. Just let me get on with my speech in the backblocks here of cocky's corner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I was trying to make was the stark difference between this government's asset reduction program and the previous government's. The previous government just frittered away on spurious causes the billions of dollars that were raised through asset sales. This was a negligent approach to this country's valuable assets. Look at their record. Not only was the sale of the AIDC botched when it was first announced in about 1990 and is only now coming to fruition in 1997, but what of the sale of Qantas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On four different occasions the Qantas sale appeared in the previous government's budget as a deficit reduction item which never eventuated. Not only was this very disruptive to Qantas operations and a dishonest approach to budget reporting but its eventual sale in 1994, which reaped billions of dollars, was spent to no long&hyphen;term advantage of finances. In fact, we know in the Keating government's term that government debt jumped from $30 billion to $100 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was the dishonest sale of the Commonwealth Bank. Time does not permit me to go too  deeply into that sale except to say that a commitment was made by the then Treasurer that the then government would hold its 51.3 per cent holdings in the Commonwealth Bank. By the way, he wrote to every shareholder saying that, and every mum and dad bought shares on that basis. He wrote to every shareholder and then, with a flick of a pen, dishonestly sold the rest of the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, of course, there was the debacle of the ANL sale. Again, time does not permit me to go into the history of that sale except that we know one thing: the stop&hyphen;start sale of that incompetent and loss&hyphen;making shipping line was only stopped for one reason, that is, the Maritime Workers Union weighed in heavily 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on the previous government. So politics prevented the sale in the national interest on that occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point to be made here is that this government has a clear, transparent and determined policy towards privatisation. It is based on the criteria of producing competitive benefits for the economy&mdash;for example, the Telstra sale, which will produce an efficient company and has allowed new entrants into the telecommunications field&mdash;and, of course, the government will use its sales to reduce the long&hyphen;term debts which we now face.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In summing up the second reading debate, firstly I thank honourable senators who contributed. It is important that the government put its view in relation to the pious second reading amendment moved by the Australian Labor Party. The government will be opposing the amendment, you will not be surprised to learn. We believe that it is vaguely hypocritical coming from the Australian Labor Party who, indeed, sought unsuccessfully to sell the AIDC over a period of time. I have taken an interest in privatisation issues since I arrived in this place. When the Australian Labor Party finally decided that `privatisation' was not a dirty word, they did seek to sell the AIDC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many of the budgets over the past four or five years of the Labor Party's final period in government, the proceeds of the sale of AIDC were included in budget figures. It was one of those items that was announced for sale virtually every time Mr Keating, Mr Willis or Mr Kerin brought down a budget, but it never quite got done. There were good reasons for that or, indeed, bad reasons&mdash;there were problems getting the sale together. It is somewhat hypocritical that the Labor Party should come to this debate and start condemning the process which we are putting into place and it looks as though, with the endorsement of the Senate, it could be successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the principles underpinning the wording of the opposition's pious amendment. Paragraph (1) talks about a reaffirmation of the principles underpinning the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3527"> AIDC's creation. Senator McGauran, in his excellent contribution to the second reading debate, said that Mr McEwen, if he were with us today, would probably have supported the sale for the reason that the AIDC was established in the way it was to promote industry and development in Australia because there was a paucity of, particularly, merchant banking skills within Australia at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone who could possibly say that there is a lack of merchant bankers out there trying to fund anything that moves would basically not know what they are talking about. The application and implementation of the recommendations of the Campbell committee of inquiry&mdash;as established by the then Treasurer, John Howard, and implemented, to the great credit of the man, by Paul Keating when he was elected Treasurer in 1983&mdash;have ensured that the banking system in Australia is far more vigorous and competitive than it was in 1970.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of my colleagues have argued that it needs to be more competitive and, as we see the implementation of the Wallis committee&mdash;the daughter of the Campbell committee&mdash;report recommendations, we hope that that will be achieved. The principles underpinning AIDC's creation may well be, in broad terms, good principles but to argue that the principles from 27 years ago are applicable now in 1997 is more a reflection of the Labor Party's approach to policy at the moment. What this is really saying is that what they did over the last 13 years was a failure, that they want to go back to the 1950s policies of the Labor Party, the 1950s policies generally&mdash;that they want to stop any tariff reduction, they want to stop reform of the tax system and they really want to call a halt to any sort of reform at all. They are saying that everything was hunky&hyphen;dory in the 1950s and that we should go back to then. That seems to be Labor's new policy approach and it seems to be reflected again in this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, of course, cannot support the proposition that we have not put a structure in place. Paragraph (2) of the pious amendment addresses the failure of Australia's capital markets to provide sufficient long&hyphen;term patient funds for industry 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> development. Paragraph (3) relates to the government needing to establish an effective means for supporting capital investment. This government, through a whole serious of policies, is, indeed, addressing those issues. Clearly the Labor Party did much to destroy investment in Australia, particularly investment in manufacturing&mdash;in fact, investment in anything. They went so far as to engineer a recession that wiped out tens of thousands of businesses; a recession that knocked 500,000 people out of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centrepoint of Labor's economic and industry policies seemed to be to engineer a recession so that so many of those people got wiped out. Australia is only just beginning to recover from those industry and economic policies. This government&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bishop interjects that they had to make it worse so that they could make it better. Dee Margetts would understand: it was the clear&hyphen;felling approach to economic and industry policy&mdash;just wipe out thousands of hectares. Senator Mark Bishop needs to be on the record: this was the Keating economic and industry policy&mdash;we needed to restructure, so we clear&hyphen;felled the Australian economy and hoped that something would emerge. Wipe out  500,000 people's jobs and tens of thousands of businesses and see what you are left with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not take that view. We are implementing a range of policies. I will run through them as quickly as I can. To enable banks to invest five per cent of their core capital in small business without prior consultation with the Reserve Bank, we have changed the prudential requirements. We have changed the tax treatment of equity investment by financial intermediaries in small and medium enterprises, so that such investments will be liable for capital gains rather than income tax. Through the business equity information service, we have sponsored several private finance matching services. We have initiated a review of the pooled development funds program, in an effort to find ways of encouraging greater capital raising and attracting greater participation from superannuation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3528"> funds in equity provision. We have initiated a significant study to look at the feasibility of an alternative equity market. In the area of corporations law, we have initiated a program called the corporate law economic reform program, which will look at easing prospectus provisions to make the raising of equity capital a lot easier for small and medium enterprises and at changing the exemptions within the corporations law to ensure that small and medium enterprises can access equity capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this government is doing a whole range of things that the previous government ignored for 13 years which will make it easier to access investment capital, for small and medium enterprises particularly. They are things that, I am sure, John McEwen&mdash;and even Senator McGauran&mdash;would support. Ours is a 1990s approach to raising investment in Australia and not the 1950s approach of the Beazley&hyphen;led opposition. They would have Australians believe that some sort of back to the future policy manifesto development program is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be opposing this second reading amendment for those reasons. I urge all honourable senators to be very careful in supporting what is clearly a very pious amendment coming from the political party which did so much to destroy industrial investment in Australia and which itself proposed the sale of AIDC but failed to sell it. This is clearly a very pious amendment. I urge all senators to oppose this amendment and support the second reading of the bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of the amendments we have circulated, as I foreshadowed in my speech in the second reading debate, is to separate out the sale of the Australian Submarine Corporation and to ensure that it is not sold without parliamentary approval&mdash;certainly at this stage. I have outlined in my speech in the second reading debate the reasons we believe that is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have amendments from the Australian Democrats which deal with the same issue but in a very different way. As I am advised, the Democrat amendments separate out the Submarine Corporation. However, it can be left to a minister at a future date, without reference to parliament, to sell the Submarine Corporation. That is the first area of difference. Secondly, the Democrat amendments give preference to the buyer of the AIDC if that is a foreign corporation. If the purchaser of the AIDC&mdash;excluding the Submarine Corporation&mdash;is a foreign corporation, it has first preference. Then, if a foreign buyer declines that first preference, the AIDC is to be put on the market in Australia. As I under 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3529"> stand it, those are the Australian Democrat amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We think they are very wishy&hyphen;washy amendments, for the reasons I have outlined. Above all else, if we are going to separate out the sale of one of the assets of the AIDC and it is not to be sold, it should come back to parliament for sale. That is a very important principle, which I would have thought that the Democrats would agree to. I am surprised they have effectively agreed to the minister&mdash;in this case, the Minister for Finance&mdash;selling it off. This is at best a holding operation for the Submarine Corporation until the government goes through the process of selling the rest of the AIDC. I do not want to talk too long on this issue. I know that time is pressing and we have a heavy commitment legislatively. Could Senator Campbell let us know when he anticipates the conclusion of the sale of the AIDC?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The effect of the amendment that Senator Murray will be moving will be that the Submarine Corporation is transferred to the Australian Industry Development Corporation, and it also contains restrictions about who can buy the Submarine Corporation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a bridge that we will have to be concerned about if that all comes to pass. I might use this opportunity, rather than having to jump up again, to say that the reason we will support Senator Murray's amendment is that it does put in place a number of sensible restrictions in relation to the transfer of what we regard as a strategic asset for Australia, and it creates a sound 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3530"> legislative framework to do that. It ensures that it cannot be sold.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Sherry said about the first right of Kockums to buy the shares out I am advised is correct but we could not legislate to override that because you would be traversing an agreement that is already in place and you would have to pay compensation. I do not even think the Australian Labor Party would want the Senate to override a contractual obligation that was negotiated when they were in power. What we are saying is that, once Kockums's right was at an end&mdash;whether or not they had exercised it&mdash;under the proposed amendment to be moved by Senator Murray, the sale could not take place to a foreigner under the definition used in the foreign takeovers act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not using the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act to create that power under this bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is hypothetical at the moment because what you have said has not happened. It may happen and a lot of people think it would be a good thing if it did happen. I am not up with negotiations in relation to deregulating foreign investment, but I would imagine that national governments would retain some significant powers in relation to the ownership of defence manufacturing and things like that. I do not know but it would be an interesting debate for another time. I will certainly research it. It is not germane to this specific bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have some significant misgivings about the effect of the Australian Labor Party's amendments, which were moved in the House of Representatives as well. They are technically flawed. I will say for the record why they are technically flawed and why Senator Murray's amendment achieves a similar result but in a better structured way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a timing problem. Proposed amendment No. 1 requires the transfer to be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the first act taken before the transfer of minorities makes AIDC Ltd a wholly owned AIDC body, which is how other transfer provisions in the bill are drafted. Yet subsection 2(a) requires transfer by 30 June 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Technical problems arise from the creation of a separate, independent power of direction and a lack of proper cross&hyphen;referencing within the legislation. So, under the amendments, any transfer would not be exempt from stamp duty under section 33X, and proceeds of the asset transfers, if any, may be extracted from AIDC Ltd under section 33U only if they are transfers under 33J. More significantly, proposed amendment No. 4 would prevent the corporation from subsequently disposing of the holding without further legislation. It would defeat the government's policy  objective of ultimately abolishing the corporation and repealing the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opposition amendment No. 4, which would prevent the repeal of the Australian Industry Development Corporation act, is not necessary in any case. The corporation cannot be abolished so long as it has any assets under the commencement provision in clause 2 of the AIDC Sale Bill. I am advised that that is not likely to occur for some 10 years at least because of the existing assets and commitments of the corporation.</PARA></SPEECH>

So there still is a requirement there, but it is quite unbelievable that a Labor Party senator should come in here and criticise the fact that a Swedish owned company should not have a right to purchase the balance of the company when it was actually the Australian Labor Party minister and government who negotiated that right. For the Senate to then seek to overturn that would be a government breach in that contract. It could quite clearly give rise to issues of compensation if the Australian government was forced to do that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Campbell was quite right in his remarks, because no government&mdash;I am referring to the previous government&mdash;negotiates a pre-emptive right with a commercial institution without having a potential sale in its mind. Quite clearly, the previous government kept that option open. The fact is that the Swedish consortium, Kockums, was given that right by Labor, has that right and has the entitlement to exercise it if it so wishes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say something in reaction to Senator Sherry's remarks. Labor has a long history of the sale of public assets. It has a committed history of economic rationalism. I stood in this chamber and heard the best possible speech I have ever heard against the sale of airports from Senator Bob Collins. Then Labor trooped over to the other side and flogged off yet another set of our assets. When I hear you&mdash;again, to use Senator Campbell's words&mdash;coming the pious on us, I look forward to the days when Labor finally gives up its old record of economic rationalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at my amendments and where we agree with and differ from Labor. Labor quite rightly referred the bill to the Senate Finance and Public Administration Commit 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tee. That committee, again quite rightly, raised serious issues which were pursued further by Labor and by us. When we had a look into it, we established that AIDC Ltd's principal asset at the moment is the Australian Submarine Corporation. So far that corporation has produced one out of five  submarines. When that contract has finished, the effect will be that unless the ASC continues with other work or in some other form, that will be the end of it. It will have a residue of depreciated assets, some intellectual property and the overhang of government investment in it over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor and the Democrats were both concerned to see that the ASC was not immediately sold off with AIDC Ltd, and that it be transferred into the AIDC. We both achieved that result. We were both concerned that it was not sold to foreign interests, except with regard to the pre-emptive right that Kockums has. Once again, we have both achieved that result. However, we have taken the view that the only way in which government can deal with this issue is by having its hands relatively untied. For us the most important thing is that the jobs and the investment and the contracts which matter so much to South Australia are preserved and do continue. We have the government's assurance that they are going to make sure that that happens. In fact, they are contractually bound to make sure that that happens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendments followed a briefing discussion with the Minister for Finance. We thank you for the courtesy accorded us. Therefore, we put together our amendment to the AIDC Sale Bill, which would achieve a number of objectives. These were: firstly, to oblige the minister to transfer their ASC shareholding to the Australian Industry Development Corporation, which is a statutory authority and is not subject to sale; secondly, to require AIDC Ltd to follow the minister's direction to transfer shares, which was vital from a legal point of view; thirdly, to preclude the transfer of the shareholding in any subsequent sale of the shares to a foreign person; and, fourthly, to use the Foreign Acquisition and Takeovers Act 1975 to establish the meaning of a foreign person.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3534">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the bill was considered by the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, of which I am a member, the ALP members issued a minority report proposing an amendment which required the transfer of the shares to the corporation. This also prevented those shares being sold in the future. That proposed amendment was drafted as a stand&hyphen;alone section of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment responding to the Democrats' concerns has been prepared to be consistent with and take advantage of the powers provided by other sections of the bill. It is to be inserted immediately after section 33K to take advantage of the power provided by 33K which enables the minister to vest the shares without the need for conveyance and this minimises the risk of triggering any pre&hyphen;emptive rights held by the shareholders in the Australian Submarine Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The drafting uses the term `AIDC body', defined elsewhere in the bill as `the corporation or a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation'. This is important, as the minister is only obliged to move the shares following the acquisition of AIDC Ltd shares from the two minority shareholders in that company, which again were a hangover from previous re&hyphen;acquisitions. Transfer of the ASC shares prior to that action could give rise to problems in relation to minority shareholders' rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The utilisation of 33K powers by the minister ensure that the powers provided elsewhere in the bill oblige AIDC Ltd to follow the minister's direction. Division 11 of the bill provides a series of injunctive powers. A date has been inserted to provide comfort that the move of the shares will take place in a reasonable time and that provides sufficient flexibility to ensure that the Office of Asset Sales and its advisers have had the opportunity to ensure that related issues concerning rights and obligations associated with the shareholding are properly addressed at the time the move takes place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AIDC Ltd holding the shares in a subsidiary company and intercompany arrangements associated with the shareholding will need to be addressed. AIDC Ltd has certain rights as a principal shareholder which will need to be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> transferred to the corporation when their shares are moved, possibly involving negotiation with the other principal shareholder, the 48&half; per cent shareholder, Kockums. The ASC shares are held through a series of subsidiary companies, AIDC Defence Holdings, which is 100 per cent owned by AIDC Investments, which in turn is 100 per cent owned by AIDC Limited. Section 33KA(l)(b) allows the shares to be moved through the companies if that fits with the intercompany relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 provides for a range of circumstances in determining a foreign person covering direct shareholdings, substantial interests, associations, trust arrangements and residency issues. Subsections 33KA(3)(a) to (d) are included to ensure that the amendment does not constitute an appropriation of existing shareholders' rights that the other parties may have. Without this, it would be necessary to provide for compensation to the other existing shareholders or the legality of the move of the ASC shareholding could be in question. The shareholder rights that would be protected would only be those that existed at the commencement of the bill. Any other regulatory requirements that would apply to those shareholder rights, such as satisfying the normal provisions of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, would not be removed. Subsections 33KA(4) and (5) are included for the purpose of clarifying the meaning of certain references in the section.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think that our amendment meets the needs of the Senate. It meets the needs of the FPA committee, as expressed in their report. It meets many of the concerns of Labor. It certainly meets most of the concerns of the Democrats and therefore we commend the amendment to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated earlier, one of my concerns is that the multilateral agreement on investment, which is being negotiated internationally at the moment, will in fact, if and when it is signed&mdash;and it may not be too long from now&mdash;have the effect of requiring Australia to change its laws in relation to access to investments. There could be a whole 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3535"> range of laws, including media laws or laws involving investment in defence industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not know what the wording of this agreement currently is or what it will be in its final form. I think our negotiators probably have a better idea than we do. Obviously, it would be a very good idea if we do know what this will be, because in the end it may well mean that our laws will have to change to conform with the multilateral agreement on investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many things have changed as a result of the World Trade Organisation, including issues of quarantine, customs standards and so on, to the detriment and concern of many people in the community. These were not mentioned by either the government or the opposition at the time these were signed on to. I do think it is time now that we started looking at what it is we are signing on to. I do not think from the sound of it that it would make much difference whether or not the Greens support it, because the numbers are obviously there. If we are going to get a warm fuzzy feeling, we should remember that that warm fuzzy feeling may not be around for very long. We may not necessarily be protecting this industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is something that you should applaud, Senator Sherry. It is good news for all Australians, particularly for those seeking jobs. It is, as Senator Knowles said, the fourth reduction in interest rates since the coalition was elected just over a year ago and already we have been able to see four reductions in interest rates with a sum total of two per cent. Interest rates are now at  their lowest level in 24 years: 7.2 per cent on variable 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> home loans. Under the coalition government we have the lowest interest rates in 24 years. Small business, as I said, is also the winner, with business variable loan rates falling to 9.25 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduction in interest rates is consistent with the government's strategy which is to produce a growth, low inflation and low interest rate environment. It indicates the benefits that can flow from the decisions that this government has been prepared to take. It is a reward for the battlers&mdash;never let that be forgotten. It is a reward for those who have been prepared to practice wage restraint despite what they are encouraged to do by the Australian Labor Party. It would be even better if the Australian banks would pass on the full benefit. I take the opportunity to welcome Aussie Home Loans' example, which has dropped its home loan variable interest rate to 6.99 per cent by passing on the interest rate reduction in full.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us briefly compare the coalition record with that of Labor. Home loan interest rates under Labor were 17 per cent in 1989&hyphen;90 and under the coalition they are 7.2 per cent. For small business they were over 20 per cent in 1989&hyphen;90 and under the coalition they are just over nine per cent. Credit card rates under Labor were over 25 per cent and under the coalition they are 16 per cent. This continues the environment of low interest rates, low inflation and strong business investment. Profits are rising&mdash;and that is more good news.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to see organisations such as the Housing Industry Association and the Real Estate Institute applauding the government's decision. What did they say?

That is good news for Australia and adds to the other benefits that have flowed from coalition decisions: the $1 billion family tax initiative, $600 million being put back into private health insurance, the savings rebate and the decision to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite clear, as one of my colleagues said, that the Labor Party really do not like good news. This budget strategy is conducive to low interest rates. In just three years the government is turning around Labor's $10.3 billion deficit, which they left the government, into a $1.6 billion surplus. This is a turnaround of some $12 billion&mdash;a major achievement of this government. While other factors do help determine interest rates, including wages, the fact remains that the budget strategy is very important in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big four banks are now offering home loan rates of 8.2 per cent, which represents an interest saving on a loan of $100,000 of some $275 a month compared to when we came into office. This represents a benefit of around $70 a week. The government is concerned that the big banks have not passed on the official interest rate cut fully to lower home loan rates. Official interest rates are done for the benefit, we hope, of consumers&mdash;not for the benefit of banks. The government believes that the battlers deserve to have their reward quickly and fully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACCC has written to the banks asking them to explain their actions in only passing on 0.35 per cent of the rate cut. It is, of course, up to the ACCC to determine if any breaches of the Trade Practices Act have occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is putting in place a low inflationary, low interest rate, strong growth environment which delivers sustained reductions in unemployment. In contrast, what is the Labor Party offering? The Labor Party has consistently opposed the government's policies to eliminate the huge deficit that was left to us by the Labor Party.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This is a measure which has been welcomed around Australia by retirees as well as by the retirement income industry. This is a measure which will make sure that financial planners are not able to advertise that you can be a millionaire and still get a social security pension. If the Labor Party is suggesting that they want to see a continuation of that, which flourished under their years in government, well they should make it very clear. On this side of the parliament we believe that people who have the means to support themselves should be expected to do so to the extent that they are capable of before they ask their neighbour or the taxpayer for assistance. That is the first part of this answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the reform to the income and assets testing of income streams is designed to give retired people more choice in how they invest their money, to be fairer to them and to encourage them to go for long-term income streams. A habit of recent times has been for the financial industry to recommend that prospective retirees should put their money into short-term measures. The way our tests are determined in the Department of Social Security means that notionally those assets are seen to disappear from the assessment. Those are the sorts of short-term products of something like five years maximum. People have the opportunity to change those by the time the proposal becomes law. They have plenty of time ahead of them now over the next year to change the way they have invested.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade. I refer to the current negotiations within the OECD for a multilateral agreement on investment, and I ask: what assessment has the government done on the impacts of this agreement on areas such as the Foreign Investment Review Board; Australian laws limiting overseas investment or cross&hyphen;ownership, such as media cross&hyphen;ownership laws; laws regulating investments themselves, such the regulations requiring a certain level of Australian content in television; and any manufacturing regime requiring a minimum Australian content or requiring re&hyphen;investment of profits in this country? When would any government assessment of these effects be made available, and would this be made available to the parliament for debate before any agreement is signed?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously we take into account in these negotiations our domestic situation and our practices in relation to manufacturing industry, international flows of capital and the like. With respect, I think Senator Margetts is approaching the issue a touch negatively. Really the issue is what benefits Australia and other communities can 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3541"> gain from the multilateral agreement on investments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we come back to what it is all about, we believe that if a regime is in place that enforces non&hyphen;discrimination and greater transparency in investment rules, then that will help contribute to economic expansion in much the same way as we have been able to do through the regime on multilateral trading. So we think that it is not conceptually possible to separate the two. Expanding the international community, with the benefits that flow in terms of higher living standards and jobs, requires an expansion in the movement of international finance as it does an expansion in international trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These negotiations, as the honourable senator will know, have been going on for some time under the auspices of the OECD. I understand it has not been an easy negotiation. In fact, the deadline for completion has had to be extended. That is quite a good sign in some ways because it indicates the international community is looking for a high quality agreement and it is not going to compromise with a lower quality outcome simply to comply with the earlier time restraints that had been applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the concept I think is sound and in the national interest. Australia will continue constructively negotiating towards a good outcome.

By way of a supplementary question: the Prime Minister has acknowledged the high levels of community disillusionment and uncertainty as a result of international agreements signed already. Given the assurances that government gave us about our sovereignty in relation to such things as quarantine barriers under the World Trade Organisation agreement, and given the subsequent debacle as a result of our lack of control in such agreements, why should we imagine that after signing this agreement any parliament in Australia will retain the ability to discriminate between overseas and Australian investment or to regulate terms at variance with the multilateral agreement on investment under which investment may occur?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

We have built Australia in part on foreign capital, and if we have in place a more transparent, non&hyphen;discriminatory capital flow regime that will be of benefit to Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Synon for that question. If any Australian who wants a job cannot get a job, that is a matter of concern to the government. With the high unemployment that we have at the moment, there are far too many people in that position. But it is of particular concern I think to all Australians when a young Australian who wants to get a job cannot get one. We all seem to have a softer spot for unemployed youth than for other Australians who perhaps have already had their first go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Youth unemployment is one of the very real and enduring legacies of the Keating government. I do not deny for one minute that youth unemployment rates are higher because of the structural changes in the economy&mdash;such that the pool of jobs for low skilled and unskilled young people who unwisely, I think, chose to leave school as soon as they could is diminishing all the time. Consequently, we have an increased youth unemployment rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, I am pleased to inform the Senate that today we had the national launch of the job placement, employment and training program, which will fund over 90 agencies nationally to assist young people across Australia. This government is committed to working with young people. While we recognise the diverse achievements of young people in many of their endeavours and congratulate them for that, we also acknowledge the need to provide for young people that have not enjoyed anything like the same level of opportunity.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3543">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is still a section of young Australians within our community that needs special assistance from the government. This government is aware of the circumstances that confront those young people and today has announced $11 million of direct assistance. We are absolutely committed in this task to working with community organisations that can provide services to young people that need assistance in our community. We are determined that each member of the community has a real chance to contribute to society and to reach their own full potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The service is funded under the JPET scheme. As I say, over 90 agencies will provide that sort of assistance to over 8,000 young Australians. The JPET program provides services to ensure that young Australians with special needs overcome the barriers to their participation in employment, education or training. The young people who will be helped by this sort of service around Australia are or have been wards of the state and some have been involved with the law. They might be students, young refugees or ex-offenders. So JPET will offer ongoing support and referral services to those under 21 and especially for those 15&hyphen; to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who have significant problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once those underlying problems are managed effectively, participants in the program will then be assisted in their efforts to gain access to education, entry level training or employment and in particular will be supported to maintain their participation in those activities. Funding of $11 million per annum for the next two years is available to assist young Australians who are homeless or at risk of becoming so. I am very pleased that over 8,000 young people will receive support from JPET in the next year and will help these young people realise their full potential.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we then got was a letter. The first thing was a  letter dated 30 August. This is what Senator Schacht said:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Seven weeks later, what did we get? We got a document which can charitably be described as a submission, outlining the ALP's broad policy position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, it starts off by saying, `The opposition opposes the inquiry's terms of reference and, therefore, we do not believe it is necessary to make a detailed submission.' So what was the point of all that? Why did you go on about seeking special leave to put in a document six or seven weeks down the track? Then you say it would be very difficult for the opposition to support recommendations produced by the inquiry, unless you turn a blind eye to the terms of reference. That is all very helpful to Mr Mansfield. Quite clearly you were not prepared to await the outcome, to make a judgment on the merits of what he recommended. You are simply saying, `In advance, we cannot support anything.'</PARA>

To say it is `dubious' as to whether the inquiry can make any reasonable recommendations, to say that some of the programs are `quintessential' in their reflection of Australian culture, and then to end up saying, `I accept without prejudice your invitation to have further discussions'&mdash;what on earth does that mean? Clearly, mindless regurgitation of legalities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it really means is, `I can't tell you. I don't want you to tell anyone either, because I really don't have any views on the ABC.' I would have thought we should all be very grateful indeed that none of this saw the light of day before the recent shadow cabinet massacre, because, clearly, Senator Schacht was much more interested in going off to Japan&mdash;trotting out his industry policy to shore up his preselection&mdash;than addressing any of the real issues.</PARA>

Minister,  I understand that the Queensland cabinet has agreed with South Australia to sign a heads of agreement on joint arrangements for the future management of the Lake Eyre Basin. Can the Minister please inform the Senate of what arrangements are being made to conserve the natural heritage of this major region in Australia, and what role the Commonwealth is playing in these arrangements?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Ferguson for that important question. Yes, the Queensland and the South Australian governments have signed this historic heads of agreement, and the Commonwealth government will be signing in support of both state governments. This approach to land management contrasts starkly with the previous approach of Labor, and it demonstrates what can be achieved through a cooperative approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is important is that the Lake Eyre Basin&mdash;which is one of the great unregulated catchments of the world really, which has priceless assets of international ecological significance and also vitally important economic assets&mdash;is now to be managed in a cooperative way by these two states, with the support of the Commonwealth, to ensure the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sustainability of both the economic and environmental assets. That is vitally important, and it shows that finally in this country we are learning from the mistakes of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now recognise, for example, what we did wrong with the Murray-Darling Basin. We now recognise that it is important to get the science right, to get in place a cooperative arrangement between all relevant parties and then to implement such arrangements to preserve these assets before it is too late. We recognise that, to maintain the economic advantages of a basin such as this, it is important to protect the natural systems as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this instance, it is important to protect the continued health of river systems such as the Thomson, the Barcoo, the Cooper, the Georgina and the Diamantina, which encompass the states of Queensland and South Australia. That is why a cooperative mechanism, in which particularly the upstream state is prepared to cooperate with the downstream state, is vitally important. Senator Ferguson, this will be good news for our constituents in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the state governments have agreed to is that they will enter into a cooperative agreement for the purposes of establishing arrangements for the integrated catchment management and water resources management of the Lake Eyre Basin, something that is long overdue. In doing so, they will adopt management plans or policies for flow management regimes that reflect current near natural variable flows of the river systems. That is great news, Senator Ferguson. In other words, a regime that will protect near natural flows of the river system really does show that we are learning from past experiences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agreement will put in place policies for objectives for land and water management in the basin, including water quality objectives and river flow objectives. We are talking about both the quality and the quantity of the water flow into South Australia. It will put in place policies that will provide for catchment management strategies to ensure that, as far as practicable, those objectives are met&mdash;including the promotion of community action to achieve the objectives for land and water  management identified under the agreement 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3549"> or management plan or policy&mdash;and processes for dealing with current usage of water for domestic and stock watering requirements and processes for dealing with significant water related development proposals for the basin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a first. Before the damage is done, in this instance two states&mdash;Queensland and South Australia&mdash;have got together and said, `Let's put into place cooperative policies which will ensure both the quality and quantity of flows within the river system and therefore ensure, in the long term, the sustainability of the great Lake Eyre Basin, sustainability both for its economic assets and for its environmental assets.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I must say that the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), surprised me with his answer today. The story that I based the question on was carried in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> . Therefore, I assumed that the minister would have a brief on it and that he would be prepared for it. I was therefore somewhat surprised to hear him suggest that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3550"> the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) had done nothing more than what was available&mdash;to quote the minister in here today&mdash;to anyone else in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does the minister representing the minister for transport seriously suggest, as he told the Senate today, that if anyone in Australia&mdash;I invite him to be one of them&mdash;rings the 1800 free call number, which he just referred to, that person would be connected with air traffic control at Sydney airport, which is what he told the Senate today would happen&mdash;because Mr Sharp had done nothing else than do what was available to any other person in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Development in the Senate seriously suggesting that CASA would run a system enabling anyone inquiring about the arrival time of an aircraft at an airport to be connected to a senior controller at Sydney airport who in fact was responsible for allocating the slots at Sydney airport for the arrival of all the aircraft? The answer that the minister gave the Senate today was utter nonsense. I have to say I would be astonished if that information was given in the brief that surely would have been provided to the minister as a result of the publicity given to these allegations, but the minister did confirm that the call indeed was made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not have to be too clever to work out just precisely what happened. It was in real terms the arrogance of office. It was this minister big&hyphen;noting himself in a way that I do not think does him any credit. Certainly, it does not do the government any credit&mdash;it is only 14 short months since the election&mdash;for the minister to get this big headed about being a federal minister in this government. The minister was flying into Sydney from Goulburn, which I think is his home airport. I understand that he was in fact flying on a chartered aircraft from a company that operates here in Canberra at Fyshwick, not on a jet, as reported in the story, but Senator Alston confirmed today the call was made from the aircraft on a mobile phone.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not complaining about that, Senator, at all and I am not suggesting you cannot. I have done it myself on light aircraft, not on jets. But, as you would know, Senator, it is not possible on a commercial aircraft nor is it possible in the VIP fleet either. They observe the rule for safety reasons as stringently as commercial aircraft do because mobile phones, being unshielded as they are, have a potential to affect the navigational instruments on board modern&hyphen;day aircraft.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not the thing I am complaining about at all. It is the absolute effrontery of the minister, who is responsible for administering the slot system at Sydney airport, a system which everyone else in Australia is expected to comply with, to try to get himself shoved up the line by big&hyphen;noting himself to a controller at Sydney airport and thereby abusing the position that he holds as a minister. That in fact is a substantive matter to raise here in the parliament, and I did not expect the nonsense we heard today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the answer&mdash;and the reason this intrigues me&mdash;is that we know the minister did this, and Senator Alston has confirmed that. But the answers Senator Alston gave raise a whole lot of questions; they do not provide any answers. Did in fact the pilot of the aircraft attempt to get an upgrade of the slot into Sydney? Why was it a passenger on board his rcraft, no matter how self-important the passenger was, who tried to get this upgrade?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now what do we have? We have the minister who is in charge of transport, John Sharp, the minister who has actually implemented the system at Mascot airport that he and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said was going to solve the problem of congestion at Sydney airport, trying to queue jump and, furthermore, doing it in a most extraordinary and, I would suggest, very improper way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Bob Collins has pointed out, the minister has utilised a service which is designed to be there for pilots of aircraft to use, those who have a legitimate right to contact air traffic control with respect to landing times at any airport. But, no, we have a minister on a chartered aircraft, as it would appear, getting on the phone and, in effect, trying to take over the role of the pilot and putting pressure on air traffic control at Sydney to get in earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This minister, I have to say, has been probably one of the most arrogant ministers in an arrogant ministry. For instance, you will recall this is the minister who wanted his own way so much with respect to appointments on the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority that he ran a public campaign denigrating the reputations of certain members of that authority and, at the same time, publicly supporting a particular candidate who now happens to have been appointed to CASA and who, many would argue, at least bears some responsibility for some of the pre-existing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> problems with respect to air safety in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a minister who treats the protests of concerned citizens in my area of Sydney with absolute disdain. A month or two ago a deputation came to this parliament, comprising 10 local council shire mayors of Sydney, representing well over one million people. They came to this parliament to meet with the minister and other members of the government and the opposition to talk about the issue of the siting of Sydney's second airport. The minister refused to see them. The minister has consistently refused to see deputations from residents groups, shire council representatives and others on this issue of Sydney's second airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to point out to the Senate while I have the opportunity that again today and for the next two days in this parliament there are representatives of various citizens groups who are campaigning against the choice of Holsworthy airport. They will be in this parliament today, tomorrow and Wednesday. There is an open invitation to the minister and other members of the government to go and talk to those representatives and hear their concerns about the problems of Sydney's second airport and air traffic congestion and aircraft noise in Sydney. The minister should do that rather than ignoring their legitimate concerns. But when he happens to get himself  caught in a position where he is a little bit inconvenienced by getting into Sydney late, what does he do? He quickly gets on the phone and tries to stand over air traffic control. I say to the minister that it is about time he changed this arrogant attitude that he has adopted and he should go and talk to those people who are now in Senate committee room 1S2.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3552"> over Sydney. I would not be at all surprised that Mr Sharp's difficulty of getting into Sydney on this particular day was caused by the runway pattern that he himself has put out, mostly at the behest of Mr Howard, to stop planes flying over the Bennelong electorate and to spread and ease the noise around Sydney, irrespective of whether it hits safety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I think Senator Collins has pointed out, there is nothing wrong with Mr Sharp taking a charter flight from Goulburn to Sydney, although I will say that the degree to which National Party ministers are using charter flights out of Canberra to go home on Friday nights when the rest of us trudge out to the airport is quite startling. That particular provision was never intended for National Party ministers to whip out to the airport after a parliamentary session. I do not know whether your brother takes you; oh, there is no airport at South Yarra, is there, Senator McGauran?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ministers pick up a plane as a taxi out of Canberra airport to go down to Gippsland and up to Mr Anderson's electorate and those of Mr Sharp and Mr Fischer. They all do it. That was not really the intention of charter aircraft. They were to get you from spot A to spot B on ministerial duty, not home quickly at night. However, if it can be shown over time that this is a cheaper method than, for example, Mr McGauran flying to Melbourne and getting a Comcar down to Traralgon or wherever he lives&mdash;I do not want to identify where he lives but I think he lives down that way&mdash;that might be fine too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have in this situation is Mr Sharp getting on his charter aircraft and he is so self&hyphen;important that he does not want to be held up going into Sydney airport. The battlers can though. They can sit up there and fly round and round in circles, as long as this bloke gets priority and gets in. I know he is a busy minister. He is so busy restructuring the Airservices board and assassinating its members in public that he probably had to get to Sydney in a hurry. But no-one in Australia likes queue jumpers. Trying to jump 14 slots ahead is not a particularly politic thing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Collins is absolutely right. Not all Australians have the right to ring the air 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> traffic controllers in Sydney. What we do not know is that if he did access the 008 number, how come he got put through to the air traffic controllers? If he did, did he have to use a special pin number that the pilot gave him? If it was only a moderate friendly little inquiry from the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, who pays their salary, maybe it is only an impolitic thing to have done. We will be able to find out because the transcripts will be there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Mr Sharp wants to hold his ground and say he did absolutely nothing wrong at all, let us release the transcripts. There will certainly not be any commercial-in-confidence aspects or any legal matters to do with it. There cannot be. Let the transcripts come out, let them be put down and we will make a  judgment on whether this was a concerned citizen innocently ringing to find out when he was getting into Sydney or whether it was a self&hyphen;important minister trying to queue jump 14 slots to get in, based on an airport design that had political connotations in its very existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also concerned, even though the instrumentation on light aircraft is different, that he was using a mobile phone. There are two things here: there is a safety aspect, which we would not like to highlight because it is less likely to occur in a light plane than a jet; but also all the telecommunications companies have objections to mobile phones being used in the air. I think the reason for that&mdash;I am not a technical person&mdash;</PARA>

So it is probably not a safety issue; it is a telecommunications issue. I want to know whether Mr Sharp was actually billed for the call or whether the plane was going quick enough so that he got a real free call. But then it was an 008 number, so we are getting into very complex territory here. What it comes back to is simply a very arrogant minister on all appearances. The only way you will be able to disprove that in my view is by publishing the

We were listening to evidence from the Lane Cove action group, from people from Leichhardt, Barry Cotter from Marrickville&mdash;who gave us a very good dissertation on what is going on&mdash;and the No Aircraft Noise Party. In fact, we asked questions about what has happened. I observed at first hand that after about 11 o'clock the whole operation switched to the east-west runway and continued that way until about 3 o'clock in the afternoon. I asked some of the people who were giving evidence, and who were obviously biased against aircraft noise, if this sharing of the noise had made any difference and they said, yes, it had.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is not for me as a Victorian to venture into the great debate of the Sydney airport and all the debacles that have followed it over the last 10 years. But Senator Ray got up in here and talked about political bias because this government opened the third runway. Well, I would have thought that is why you built three runways&mdash;to open it up and maximise your ability to land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But for him to talk about this minister opening up the third runway to gain some sort of political advantage for the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his seat of Bennelong is absolute nonsense when we all know that it was the previous minister, Laurie Brereton, whose absolute motivation was to shut down one complete runway so that it would not go over his particular electorate. Coming from 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Victoria, I know that much: you built a third runway and then shut one down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will offer some advice to the minister. Given the queues at Sydney airport and the debacle that has followed over the past 10 years because of previous policies, it is probably timely for me to mention that that sort of delay would not happen in Victoria, currently. If he were to land at the Essendon airport, he would get an instant result. There are no queues at the Essendon airport, being as efficient as it is. It is Melbourne's second airport and it should remain so and remain open. I just offer that timely advice to the minister: these sorts of delays and frustrations just do not occur in Victoria, because of our good airport system and the two that are in the inner city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a week when we have had good economic news, namely the lowering of interest rates, in today's question time there was not one single question from the opposition on the economy&mdash;not one single question. What we have had are all these lightweight issues today, such as the minister chartering into Sydney airport. We have had a question on a political adviser to Tony Abbott, for heaven's sake, and what he could take out of the office, and also several questions from the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Faulkner) on the position of the Prime Minister's senior Public Service adviser, Mr Max Moore-Wilton&mdash;none of them relevant. None of them are relevant to the everyday lives of Australians. I accept that they are probably trying to build up some sort of political perception, some sort of flawed political perception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the fact of the matter is that, in a week that we have had good economic news in this economy, the opposition is attempting to distract the government and the Australian people&mdash;and the media no doubt&mdash;to focus on these shallow pathetic issues that do not go to the heart of government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Sir William was born on 19 September 1916 in Sydney. His service to the nation began during World War II when he enlisted in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Citizen Military Forces and soon transferred to the 2nd Australian Imperial Force. He served in New Guinea and rose from gunner to the rank of lieutenant with the 82nd Australian Mobile Searchlight Battery. Even before entering federal parliament, he had given active and successful service in local politics. He was an alderman of the Waverley Municipal Council from 1949 to 1953 and served as mayor from 1952 to 1953.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He became a member of the House of Representatives in 1955, winning the seat of Phillip for the Liberal Party. He held the seat until 1961 and then again from 1963 to 1972. His maiden speech characterised his concern for the issues facing Australia in the Cold War era and the difficulties confronting the wheat and wool industries. He also spoke of the need for the government of the day to communicate and explain its policies to the people and the need for streamlining the country's industrial relations system: issues which are, perhaps not surprisingly, equally pertinent and important today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During his 15 years in the parliament Sir William contributed extensively to the work of a range of parliamentary committees. He was, as I said, elected as Speaker of the House of Representatives in February 1967. The six years that he occupied the Speaker's chair saw some colourful episodes and turbulent debates in the House which tested his mettle and his impressive parliamentary and political skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His public service was recognised both overseas and at home. In 1969 he was awarded the Korea Order of Distinguished Service Merit 1st Class for his contribution to the promotion of friendly relations between the Republic of Korea and the Commonwealth of Australia. In 1970 he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir William's passing will be mourned by all those who knew him.

He fought in World War II, enlisting firstly in the CMF in March 1942 and transferring to the 2nd AIF in July of that same year. During the course of the war he rose from the rank of gunner to the rank of lieutenant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He had a long and, I think it is fair to say, turbulent parliamentary career, being first elected to the House of Representatives in 1955. He won the seat of Phillip from Joe Fitzgerald, a great Labor stalwart who had won the seat of Phillip when it was created in the 1949 redistribution. Bill Aston won Phillip again in 1958 but in the election of 1961, where Labor clawed back many seats, he was defeated along with 15 other Liberal members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New South Wales electoral folklore has always been characterised by really tough, knock&hyphen;down, drag&hyphen;out, hard fought contests in the seat of Phillip. Having been defeated in 1961, Bill Aston was successful in the 1963 election until he was defeated in 1972 by Joe Riordan, who went on to become a minister in the Whitlam government. The 1969 result was a classic example. Bill Aston won the seat in 1969 by 221 votes. Of course, there was much muttering from the Labor Party afterwards about possible Court of Disputed Returns appeals and the like. But that really did characterise what occurred in Phillip right through until the seat was recently abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During his time in the parliament, Bill Aston was a member of many committees, including the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs. He also served as Deputy Government Whip from 1959 to 1961 and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1963 to 1964, and then as Government Whip from 1964 to 1967. But it was as Speaker of the House of Representatives that Bill Aston's service to this parliament was most notable. He held that position of Speaker from 1967 until the defeat of the McMahon government in 1972. It was a long parliamentary career for Bill Aston in a tough inner metropolitan electorate in Sydney that was famous for its close fought struggles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bill Aston was noted also for the nature of many of his parliamentary contributions. He was noteworthy, I think, for many of the rulings he made as Speaker of the House of Representatives. Not all times were these rulings accepted with good grace by the then opposition, the Labor Party, but I think on both sides of the parliament and certainly in the Labor Party we acknowledge the significance of the parliamentary contribution that Bill Aston made. On behalf of the opposition, we offer our sincere sympathy to his family and his friends.</PARA></SPEECH>

He served his nation in local government and federal government and in war over a period of some 40&hyphen;odd years. He was 15 years in the federal parliament where he was knighted and became the Speaker of the federal House of Representatives.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3559"> the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable `active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator Cooney</NAME><FROM>(from 10 citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER>and, <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator Kernot</NAME><FROM>(from 39 citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Petition of the undersigned shows that only one group have been excluded from eligibility for the repatriation benefits in the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) where such group has performed honourable overseas `active service'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That group being members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 which were excluded under `Operational Service' at Section 6. (1)(e)(ii) of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The various claims made in Statements to the House and the Senate and the contents of correspondence from various Ministers to maintain the exclusion are answered as follows, the answers are from documents obtained under FIO and from the public record:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) `They were never allotted for operational service', (contained in a letter from the Hon. Con Sciacca Minister for Defence Science and Personnel 1995). A letter from the Secretary Department of the Navy to Treasury dated 11 November 1955 stated `the date that the Navy were allotted for operational  service was 1 July 1955'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) `Members of the RAN were only doing the duty for which they had enlisted' October 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation in the Senate. This applies to Service personnel everywhere. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) `They were in no danger', (November 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation in the Senate). They shared the same danger as all other Australian Service personnel serving in Malaya at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv) `They were not on Special Overseas Service', (in a letter from the office of The Hon. Bronwyn Bishop Minister for Defence Industry Science and Personnel to Mrs Williams of Adelaide dated October 1996). Requirement for Special Overseas Service was introduced in 1962 without retrospective conditions, therefore has no relevance to events of 1960.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(v) `They were not on Active Service', (in a letter from the office of The Hon. Bronwyn Bishop Minister for Defence Industry Science and Personnel dated October 1996). It is now, as it was then, that Service Personnel had to comply with one of three requirements for Active Service, this group complied with two, or twice as many as is needed. The one that they did not comply with was `is in military occupation of a foreign country'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request that the Senate should remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act, thereby giving the Australian sailors involved comparative recognition with the Army and RAAF personnel that served at the same time, and all other Australians who have served their Country on active service overseas.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator Reynolds</NAME><FROM>(from 12 citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill puts into place key elements of labor's new automotive industry plan.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill gives members a simple choice&mdash;a vote for or against the Australian automotive and components industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides a level of certainty in Australia's motor vehicle and components industry by providing that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tariff remains at 15 per cent until at least 31 December 2004;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There be continuation of a scheme designed to enhance the industry's integration into the international marketplace (currently the export facilitation scheme), which meets our international trade obligations, until at least 31 December 2004.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Continuation of the duty&hyphen;free allowance and more support for industrial research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against our plan, industry has committed to: 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A doubling of motor vehicle exports to 100,000 units per year.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A trebling of components exports to $3 billion</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Up to 10,000 new jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That's jobs growth and balance of payments correction&mdash;the two most pressing economic issues facing the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure does not breach Australia's APEC commitment to free trade&mdash;that remains a vital goal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nor does it signal a return to the 50s, 60s or 70s.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather, it continues the scheduled reductions in place to 2000, it puts in place a 5&hyphen;year freeze to 2005, recognising that we are already well ahead of the game, and it ensures that the rest of the world catches up to us, because unilateral disarmament on tariffs is not in Australia's best interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In announcing labor's car plan we called for a bipartisan approach&mdash;because industry needs the certainty that goes beyond a single term of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So far the government has delivered the industry anything but certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the prime minister has said there would be no "slash&hyphen;and&hyphen;burn" policy on the car industry, the treasurer asks, over port and cigars at the commonwealth club, "why don't we just let mitsubishi go?"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This sort of confusion is bad for investment and bad for jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And the federal government is the only major player to have not responded to labor's plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, which encompasses the key elements of labor's car plan, will force the government to respond.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That response should be to back the bill, because the Australian automotive industry isn't just ford, holden, mitsubishi and toyota.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry includes over 200 components manufacturers across the country (such as BTR engineering, for example, which employs 600 people in the deputy prime minister's electorate).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a government which has hidden on every major industry policy issue.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">And now the government are hiding the final report of the productivity commission rather than release it to the public.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will provide legislative authority for the entry into force of an Exchange of Notes amending the comprehensive double taxation agreement between Australia and Vietnam. The bill will insert the text of the Notes into the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 as a schedule to that act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Exchange of Notes with Vietnam took place on 22 November 1996. The notes give effect to Australia's undertaking in 1992, at the time the double taxation agreement with Vietnam was signed, that Australia would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> grant tax sparing for specified Vietnamese tax concessions.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tax sparing describes the situation under which Vietnam offers tax concessions to attract foreign investment. Under the proposed tax sparing credit arrangements, an Australian investor taking advantage of specified tax concessions is deemed to have paid the tax actually forgone by Vietnam for the purposes of Australia's foreign tax credit rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without tax sparing credits, Vietnamese tax concessions granted to Australian residents could be negated by Australia's foreign tax credit rules, which would effectively "top up" Vietnamese taxes paid to the level of tax that would be payable on an equivalent amount of Australian domestic income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To qualify for tax sparing under these notes, three tests must be met. First, the activity must qualify for a tax concession under a Vietnamese law specified in the notes. Secondly, the incentive must be for a specified activity, targeted to genuine economic development and active business income, which is listed in the notes. A third test excludes certain activities and arrangements from tax sparing and a general anti&hyphen;avoidance provision is also included.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A benchmark rate of 20 per cent has been set to determine the Vietnamese tax otherwise payable. This is because at the time the notes were negotiated a variety of nominal tax rates were applicable to foreign investors in Vietnam ranging from 25 per cent down to 10 per cent. Consequently it was essential to establish an underlying tax rate to act as a benchmark to calculate the amount of tax forgone by Vietnam under a relevant tax concession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As is customary in Australian tax sparing arrangements, the tax sparing benefit is provided to Australian residents for a limited period of 10 years commencing from the date of effect, of the 1992 Agreement&mdash;that is, from the commencement of the year of income that began on 1 July 1993. There  is provision for a subsequent extension of this period. Provision is also to be made for amendment of assessments made before the notes enter into force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The notes will enter into force when further diplomatic notes are exchanged advising that the necessary constitutional processes to give the agreement the force of law in Australia has been completed. The finalisation of the tabling processes related to taking binding treaty action and the enactment of this bill will complete the processes required of Australia for those purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not possible to quantify the tax forgone by the Australian Revenue in providing tax sparing credits for the Vietnamese tax incentives with precision. Much depends on the amount of the income subject to tax sparing, the amount of the reduction or exemption applied to the particular income, the nature of the investment income, the legal structures used by Australians to make these investments and the ability of Australian taxpayers to utilise the tax spared foreign tax credits. Subject to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3569"> these qualifications, an annual cost to Revenue of around $10&mdash;15 million is estimated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under new arrangements introduced by this Government to promote greater community awareness and discussion of treaty obligations, these notes and a National Interest Analysis were tabled in this House on 11 February 1997. The notes have already been reviewed by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the first tax treaty to be reviewed by the Committee. It held two hearings on this treaty and took submissions from the Australian Taxation Office, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. During that process a number of important issues concerning these notes were clarified. The Committee reported on this treaty in March.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tabling and Committee hearings have permitted significant public debate and clarification of these notes already.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommended that the exclusion of accounting and auditing services from tax sparing should be kept under review and if Vietnamese legislation is amended, negotiations commence to provide tax sparing. Importantly, the Committee supported early ratification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will be responding to the recommendations shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that this Exchange of Notes will contribute positively to the strengthening of trade, investment, and wider relationships between Australia and Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CRIMES AMENDMENT (FORENSIC PROCEDURES) BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. This bill is long overdue. Its purpose is to amend the Crimes Act 1914 to implement the recommendations of the ALRC Report No. 2 on Criminal Investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even in 1975, the ALRC was of the view that `the probative value of this kind of evidence is such that it ought to be obtainable and admissible, provided that enforceable safeguards for the accused are built into the system'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law noted that there was no general commonwealth law dealing with the medical or forensic examination of a person in lawful custody, and that the majority of State and Territory laws merely authorised a medical examination where reasonable grounds exist to believe that an examination of a person will afford evidence as to the commission of the crime or offence involved (cf s.353A(2) Crimes Act (NSW), s. 236 of the Criminal Code (WA), and s.8 1 of the Summary Offences Act 1953 (SA))</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. In such general provisions, doubt exists as to the extent of the power, even on the basic question of whether or not samples may be taken without consent. The recent Fernando case in NSW clearly demonstrates this. In that case, the two men charged with the murder of nurse 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Sandra Hoare, refused to supply blood samples and challenged the NSW legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NSW Court of Criminal Appeal held that the legislation did not in fact authorise the taking of blood samples without consent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Following this decision, an amendment was quickly made to enable blood, hair or saliva samples to be taken in NSW without consent, although no safeguards were added at that time. Indeed, the fact that safeguards vary between jurisdictions is of concern. Some of the current legislation contains virtually no safeguards at all. Other acts have basic protections such as examination by a medical practitioner, limitation on the presence of persons of the opposite sex during the examination, and provision to the person of a copy of the report. Even the requirement for a court order is not consistently provided where there is lack of consent or where the use of force is required. For example, none is required in South Australia or Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. Fulfilling the need for consistent, and if possible uniform, laws throughout Australia, especially those laws which profoundly affect the rights of Australian citizens in the criminal justice system, is a priority for this government. We have seen the passage of the foundation provisions of the Model Criminal Code, which is a major step in modelling a co-operative scheme for removing basic inconsistencies in principles of criminal responsibility  throughout Australia. The Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Act 1994 performed the same function in relation to arrest and search powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. The Model Criminal Code Officers Committee (which is the body working towards a uniform criminal Code to be adopted by all Australian jurisdictions) prepared a model Forensic Procedures Bill which was widely circulated for comment to about 600 groups and individuals, representing many interests defence lawyers, investigators, prosecutors, judges, academics, law societies, bar councils, civil liberties groups, human rights organisations, women's groups, victims groups, legal aid organisations, government Departments and interested individuals. When the Commonwealth commenced  its own consultation process, a revised bill was again circulated. Over 60 submissions were received, analysed, and as far as practicable, recommendations were incorporated into the bill. Few submissions advocated the complete abandonment of the exercise. Most were concerned with striking the correct balance between the civil liberties of the individual and the requirement for the police to have adequate investigative powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. Both the Model Criminal Code Officers Committees Bill and the commonwealth bill are modelled on the Victorian legislation, which, in turn implemented the recommendations of the Victorian Consultative Committee on Police Powers of Investigation. Seldom has a proposal requiring a delicate balance of civil liberties and law enforcement concerns been subjected to such a degree of scrutiny. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3570"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. This bill was introduced in Parliament and passed by the House of Representatives in late 1995. The bill lapsed when the Parliament was prorogued in 1996. This government has made minor but important changes to the bill, most of which increase the safeguards for suspects who undergo a forensic procedure. The changes to the bill are in the most part, a response to the recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. That committee made twenty recommendations, the majority of which will be implemented by this proposed legislation. The changes to the original bill fulfil another of this government's election commitments; namely to "review the Forensic Procedures Bill to ensure that the bill does not unduly infringe the rights and liberties of citizens."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. It is crucial to this legislation that it be framed to balance the public interest in obtaining evidence relevant to the offence, against the public interest in upholding the physical integrity of the suspect. The government believes that this bill now achieves that balance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10. I believe that it is quite reasonable, in the interests of effective law enforcement, to request, and if necessary require, suspects to undertake relatively simple procedures either to exonerate themselves or to provide evidence that could confirm their involvement in a relevant offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11. The bill provides a comprehensive scheme for obtaining forensic samples from adults, children under the age of 18 years, and persons incapable of managing their own affairs. It sets out the powers and obligations of police when carrying out the procedures, and details the many safeguards to protect the rights of individuals, with particular provisions for Aboriginal persons, Torres Strait Islanders, children and incapable persons. These safeguards include the right to an interpreter and the provision of full information about the relevant procedure and the suspect's rights, in a language likely to be understood by the person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12. However, in my view, a most potent safeguard in the present bill is provided by the legislative barrier to admissibility of evidence obtained from a forensic procedure carried out in breach of the legislation. If there is any breach, the prosecution must justify to the court that there are good reasons why the statutory scheme was not followed. In such a case, the probative value of the evidence will not, by itself, justify its admission. The bill indicates a number of matters which the court must take into account in considering whether to admit such evidence, including the gravity of the contravention and whether it was intentional or reckless.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence is also inadmissible by the prosecution, with no discretion on the part of the court, where material is not destroyed in the circumstances required by the legislation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would argue very strongly that these are not innocuous substances. They are substances about which we should be highly concerned and indeed they are officially classified as hazardous or potentially hazardous materials. We are arguing that the precautionary princi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3573"> ple demands that they receive more serious consideration than is allowed for under these regulations. Surely the precautionary principle demands that the minister must be required to actually make a decision, not just let them slip through in the paperwork system somewhere, not get caught up in someone's in&hyphen;tray and not simply be deferred because a decision was very difficult to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This regulation similarly does not result in hazardous wastes being dealt with in an environmentally friendly or environmentally sound manner as is required by the Basel Convention. The convention is designed to cover all hazardous waste trade. The OECD is not, and should not, be exempt from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Basel convention is designed to minimise the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes. Article 4(9) suggests that trade in hazardous wastes should only be allowed if the state of export does not have the technical capacity and the necessary facilities to deal with this material&mdash;to find a suitable way of handling waste and to dispose of it in an environmentally sound and efficient manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So these regulations at the moment are really just encouraging export to get rid of the material if treatment or disposal facilities are not presently in existence. In other words, they encourage decisions to permit trade which could hinder the development of domestic treatment and recycling technologies and facilities and, of course, they inhibit the widely held belief that we should be minimising the production of these materials in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that regulation 16(4) should require the Australian government to consider the desirability of developing, as well as using, recovery facilities in Australia so that we do not have a situation where hazardous waste that could be dealt with here is exported, thus continuing a cycle where the market to recycle and treat such waste domestically remains basically unstimulated. In summary, in disallowing these regulations we are seeking to bring them in line with both the spirit and the letter of the Basel convention.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ways we are revisiting a previous debate  because the Australian Democrats objected to the provisions in the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill, which was passed shortly after we came to government. In fact, from my memory it was the first bill that was passed by the incoming government. I have to concede that it did not originate with the new government. In fact, it was a bill of the previous Labor government that was not passed at the time of the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was improved slightly by the incoming government and then received passage in this place. But there were some parties within the Senate which objected to the article 11 agreement then, and still do, and they are now attacking it at the next stage, that is, they are attacking the regulations to implement the article 11 agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point I want to make is that Senator Lees said that what is being done in these regulations is inconsistent with the spirit of the bill. In fact, it is specifically provided for in the convention that parties can enter into article 11 agreements whereby they regulate the transfer of hazardous wastes, and the detail of the rules under which the transfer occurs may be slightly different than if such an agreement had not been entered into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the agreement for OECD countries was entered into in 1992. It is referred to as the decision on transboundary movements of hazardous waste destined for recovery operations. That is relevant because the previous legislation did not provide for trade in wastes. We now cover within the legislation the potential for trade in wastes. The OECD countries rely on the agreement that they entered into in 1992, which is specifically provided for in article 11 of the convention. So there is nothing extraordinary in this at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next point that is made by the Australian Democrats to attack that is the argument that the regime is less stringent than it otherwise would be under the act. I draw to Senator Lees's attention that, whilst the agreement under article 11 may contain different rules, it `shall stipulate provisions which are not less environmentally sound' than those in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3574"> convention. So it can provide for a different set of rules but not a set of rules that are less  environmentally sound. So the fear that Senator Lees is seeking to introduce into this debate by suggesting that this process is environmentally unsound is, I submit, baseless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to the third point that Senator Lees makes. I remind you that, although she seemed to be specifically debating only one aspect of the regulations, the effect of passing this motion would be that you strike down all the regulations in respect of the OECD agreement. The provision that she has specifically referred to relates to the amber list, which she specifically argues is environmentally less rigorous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To start off with, she was speaking about the export of hazardous wastes and argued that there is a less onerous obligation on the minister in that regard. The relevant provision actually relates only to the import of amber wastes, Senator Lees, as I understand it. There is nothing that stops me, as minister, from prohibiting that import.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no reason why I would not make a decision one way or the other. The argument you are seeking to develop is that there is a risk associated with this. I suggest to you that that risk is not present, because the power is there for the government of the day&mdash;you might not like the government&mdash;to stop the import. You are protected in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also advised that one inadvertent consequence of striking down these regulations would be that the protective mechanism that exists in relation to some amber substances would be removed all together. In other words, as it is at the moment, they are not included within the red list but they are included within the OECD list, so they are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> subject to this protective regime. But if you  strike down all of these regulations, that protective regime will not exist in relation to those substances at all. If you are interested in that, we can get you a list of those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons specifically&mdash;because we have had this debate before, and it was the will of the Senate that the OECD agreement and Australia's participation within it be supported&mdash;I urge the Senate to defeat this motion. I remind the Labor Party that it was their government in 1992 that entered into the OECD agreement. It was their decision as a government to legislate to provide for it through an amendment to our hazardous waste act. The incoming government agreed with Labor in that regard and thus implemented the provision. For all those reasons, I urge the Senate to defeat this motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Lees' motion and I do so for two reasons. First of all, Senator Lees from the Democrats has outlined a list of shortcomings which will exist if the regulations which are unsatisfactory go through. The minister at the table, the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), says, `Trust me,' but, for environmentalists around this country, that has become less and less an attractive proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to remember that the minister at the table is asking us to trust him with the import&mdash;he confines it to just the import, not the export&mdash;of a certain category of hazardous waste. But as far as environmentalists are concerned, we have seen him support the opening of the flood gates for the export of uranium and for the export, in record levels, of woodchips from our high quality forests in this country. That is just to name two, but I could go on and list his irresponsible role when it comes to the national obligation to put some sort of cap on this country's greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to the world-wide global warming problem. We know that when he goes to Kyoto he will default on that as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister said to Senator Lees, `These regulations are okay because I'll make sure the environmentally excellent thing is done.' Go and tell that to somebody else, Senator 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3575"> Hill. It does not rub with the environment movement in this country, and I have no doubt that it is not going to fill with confidence and assuredness the members of the environment community who specifically work in the area of hazardous waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I understand her correctly, Senator Lees said that the Senate cannot amend these regulations. These regulations are short of the mark. By opposing the regulations, we do not wipe out the need for tightening up of the laws regarding the trade in hazardous waste. We simply say to the minister, `Go back and come in with specific regulations which show us what you are going to do to regulate the importing'&mdash;as he would have it&mdash;`of the specific hazardous wastes that are called the amber group.' In other words, in that group, the warning light is flashing. Even if the wastes in this group are not regarded as the most toxic things that could float around the world, you get the amber light which says, `Treat with great caution.' We have the minister saying, `Trust us,' and we have Senator Lees saying, `It could be left in the minister's too&hyphen;hard basket.' And simply by default, the proposition put to Australia involving the trade in these hazardous wastes will proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So either the minister can make a decision against the environmental interests of the country in regard to the trade in these wastes or he can simply fail to act&mdash;as Senator Lees put it&mdash;and the trade will occur. Failure to act is not a safeguard. Failure to act allows the trade to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On both those counts, I would have to side very clearly with the disallowance of these regulations, and I hope the Senate does so and I hope the Labor Party does so, too. This is simply an instruction to the minister to go back and do this properly. Make it clear in these regulations how you are going to treat this category of toxic waste and do not leave it to us to accept on trust that you or your subsequent ministers will do the right thing. That is not good enough.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These  regulations are made under section 13(c) of the Hazardous Waste (Regu 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lation of Exports and Imports) Act. This is the  section of the act which refers to article 11 arrangements under the Basel convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Article 11 arrangements provide for bilateral, multilateral or regional agreements or arrangements regarding transboundary movements of hazardous wastes or other wastes with parties or non-parties provided that such agreements or arrangements do not derogate from the environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes and other wastes as required by the Basel convention. All transboundary movements provided for under these regulations must therefore be compatible with environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes and other wastes as required by the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Article 11 arrangements must not be less environmentally sound than those provided by the Basel Convention. Therefore, in our view these regulations do not dilute the environmental requirements set out in the Basel Convention. These regulations provide a legal framework for an OECD decision that was agreed to by Australia in 1992. This process includes a three-tiered system to classify hazardous wastes into green, amber and red, obviously with the strictest controls being placed on hazardous wastes classified in the red tier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, in some instances the OECD decision provides stricter controls on hazardous waste transportation than is required under the Basel Convention. An example is aluminium ash waste controlled under these regulations but it is not controlled under the Basel Convention. In addition to providing greater control over some waste, particularly those in the green tier, these regulations streamline the process for transportation between OECD countries while ensuring that the arrangements are not less environmentally sound.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government supported the arrangements contained in the OECD decision. I agree with many of the arguments that have been put forward about the inadequacy of the current government's protection of our environment and, of course, the hopelessness of the current environment ministers&mdash;I mean, minister. It probably is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3576"> ministers actually, because Senator Parer seems to be playing a pretty active role in Senator Hill's responsibilities. Although I do not always agree with the speeches that Senator Brown makes, he has made a sound case about the number of occasions that the current government has sold out environment protection in this country. I do not know how an embarrassed environment minister can sit through some of these contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this particular occasion, as these regulations provide the framework for the operation of the arrangements made in the OECD decision, the opposition does support these regulations. Hence, we will not be supporting the disallowance motion. I repeat that the strength of the arguments about this government's environmental performance and Senator Hill's stewardship of his own portfolio have been very strong. A very strong case has been presented by Senator Brown and Senator Lees today in relation to that matter, but I am confident that the hazardous waste regulations that were put in place by an administration that did care about the environment will stand the test of time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In debating the second reading of the Customs and  Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996, I would just like to go back to a little bit of history with regard to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. The diesel fuel rebate scheme provides rebates of excise or customs duty on diesel fuel purchased for specific off-road uses in mining operations and primary production&mdash;for example agriculture, fishing and forestry operations, although 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3577"> the forestry operations have been somewhat limited in more recent times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme was introduced in its current form in 1982.

The scheme assists Australian mining operations and primary production to remain internationally competitive by making sure we do not unnecessarily tax business inputs. Diesel is, to these industries, as important as electricity or natural gas is to manufacturing operations. Electricity and gas are not subject to excise.</PARA>

Indeed, when Labor was in government, Treasury often took a view that the scheme was a subsidy paid to industry. That was a view that we clearly disagreed with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government has, on a number of occasions, tightened eligibility in various areas of the scheme. We accept that that has had to happen. We have also always accepted that the scheme should be retained. With regard to the retention of the scheme and this current government's position, it was very interesting, both prior to the election and immediately after, that there was some speculation about whether or not the scheme was going to continue. Indeed, I think the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and a few others indicated that maybe the scheme would end. I suppose that was speculation. In so far as agricultural purposes were intended, it was the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) back in late May who, with a nod, nod, wink, wink speech to the NFF, said, `No, farmers are all A&hyphen;OK. You'll be protected.' Then, of course, just before the budget, Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, told the mining industry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in consultation with the mining industry there will be some adjustments by legislation to limit eligibility, but the core thrust and coverage of the scheme will be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Treasurer in his budget speech said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are measures to tighten eligibility and clamp down on misuse, but the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme remains. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I understand it, it was foreshadowed in the budget documents that there would be a  saving of around $440 million over four years. In the budget statement No. 3, the government said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The operation of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme . . . is to be revamped from 1 January 1997 to curb overclaiming of the rebate and contain the associated growth in outlays. This measure will address the concerns raised by the Australian National Audit Office about `leakages' from DFRS, and curtail the excessive growth of outlays stemming from Administrative Appeals Tribunal/Federal Court decisions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">With regard to those matters, the amendments to the bill before us are primarily intended to restrict eligibility in the mining operations category; to close loopholes; to address, as I said, the recent Federal Court and AAT decisions that have had the effect of widening the definition of mining operations as that relates to the diesel fuel rebate scheme; and to improve accountability of the scheme and reduce expenditure under the scheme from misuse, following strong criticism of the Customs administration by the Auditor&hyphen;General. With regard to the Auditor&hyphen;General's report and recommendations, I would particularly like to go to recommendation 2 which in part says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANAO recommends that DIST, in consultation with Customs and other relevant departments, comprehensively examine DFRS&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And dot point one states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">seek clarification of its purpose and objectives.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that is one of the most important things that the ANAO has suggested with regard to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. The response from Customs is cited here as being accepted in relation to administration of the scheme and DIST's response is that it is accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal there was to clarify the purpose and objectives. If you look back at most, if not all, of the court and AAT appeals and challenges to its application, it has been probably because there has never been a very clear and specific intent and objective for this scheme. Even now, the government has not really addressed that question.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3578">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst it is recognised and accepted that some tightening up of the scheme is needed to make sure the rebate applies to specific off&hyphen;road uses, what is disturbing is that these amendments that are proposed fail to recognise or even take account of concerns raised by the mining and cement industries&mdash;and, indeed, even the rural sector. This is despite the fact that the government claims the amendments have come about as a result of extensive consultations and despite statements from their own colleagues&mdash;government members&mdash;of support for the existing scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister will remember that the government set up this high level negotiation group of which Senator Parer and Mr Prosser were members. There was some discussion and, for all intents and purposes, an agreement was reached. But it would seem to me that the industry is still far from being happy&mdash;the mining industry in particular&mdash;with the outcome of those consultations and, indeed, the shape of the agreement that was finally reached. It has been reached to some extent but there is still significant concern with regard to the ongoing problem that will be associated with the intent of this scheme. What is the real intention of the scheme? The Prime Minister said the group was established to undertake a specific task. The Prime Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the intent of the changes should be to achieve the dual objectives of facilitating an expanding, competitive minerals sector while containing the expenditure growth flowing from widening eligibility beyond the intent of the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The changes were announced on 31 October and both Senator Parer and Mr Prosser made much about the extensive consultations that had taken place. Yet, even following that, the Minerals Council of Australia still  have some concerns. Mr Ellis, on behalf of the Minerals Council, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the legislation and the comments made by the minister in his Second Reading Speech appear to go beyond that agreement. They do not provide the certainty integral to our agreement. Following a detailed analysis of the legislation, the Council will be seeking the Government's cooperation to rectify the apparent unintended consequences . . .  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It still comes back to the point that there is no clear definition of what is intended to be achieved from the diesel fuel rebate scheme. There is a broad recognition that it is there to assist industries and create a level playing field. Even when you look at some other  countries where diesel fuel, as an input into producing goods, is significantly cheaper than it is here in Australia, there is still this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we have not heard the government dispel the speculation that there may well be a cap placed on the diesel fuel rebate scheme, which would create total uncertainty. It is a ridiculous situation. I do not know how you would work it; maybe you can explain that, Minister. If you have a cap and you get all of the claims in, what percentage of the claim will be paid, to whom and on what basis? There is nothing worse, in so far as our mining industry and our agricultural industry are concerned, than having those sorts of uncertainties hanging over them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is of particular concern to me is the issue that relates to the cement industry. I guess I am referring to the cement industry in my own state because it has a significant investment in Tasmania, both in terms of infrastructure and employment. In 1993 Australian Cement Holdings, which is Goliath Portland Cement at Railton, completed the bulk of its site upgrade&mdash;a capital expenditure on site which is ongoing. At the completion, in excess of $100 million will have been spent. In addition, a $50 million ship was purchased in the same year for the specific purpose of transporting cement products to mainland markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A major investment is also taking place in the form of a new limestone mine. This development involves some 100 trucks operating at any one time and, consequently, their diesel fuel usage is quite significant. Some 200 people are employed directly at Goliath and the flow&hyphen;on employment effect is substantial. Shaw Contracting, a Tasmanian based company which is employed by the company, has as many as 100 vehicles on site at any one time. In Tasmania, Australian Cement Holdings owns Besser and Cornwall. In all 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3579"> they employ somewhere in the vicinity of 350 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since June 1995, Goliath Portland Cement has not received the diesel fuel rebate, despite the fact that one company within the Australian cement group is receiving the rebate. This government has been claiming that the very reason they are not receiving the rebate is because, in 1995, we removed it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Parer says that is true but it is not so. It is true that we did tighten up the eligibility but it was always the intention that the amended legislation would continue to provide a rebate for diesel fuel used for the purpose of mining calcite, or calcium, from limestone for the production of cement. That is even supported in a letter from Mr Prosser, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Firstly, just to dispel this myth that you people keep trying to push about, I refer to a letter dated 9 August 1995 from the then Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht, in which, in part, he says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the law continues to allow rebate to be paid where an activity can be said to be `mining for minerals' and does not simply constitute the extraction of the now excluded materials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, the legal test is whether the activities of a claimant are carried out with a view to recovering from the limestone ore, a mineral or minerals such as calcium carbonate (or calcite). If this is the case, then the rebate is payable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In a further letter from the now minister, Mr Prosser, dated 16 October 1996, the minister, in part, says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most quarrying materials previously eligible for diesel fuel rebate became ineligible on 1 July 1995. The only materials presently eligible are limestone for use in de&hyphen;acidification of soil in agriculture and materials from which the mineral content is extracted, such as rutile.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Minister, that somewhat makes a bit of an untruth what you have been saying and what you told me in estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cement industry, in its submission to the Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into the Customs and Excise Legislation Bill (No. 2) 1996, highlighted the inequity of the situation. I would like to refer to that submission because they also acknowledge the fact 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the then minister, Senator Schacht, had written to them. It was their view that what he had said was correct. In their submission&mdash;and I will read part of it&mdash;they said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Cement Industry mines limestone for the sole purpose of recovering the mineral calcite or calcium from what is a naturally occurring raw  material. Under the `mining for minerals' test we believe we are eligible for the diesel fuel rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Cement Industry enjoyed the benefit of the diesel fuel rebate prior to the legislation passed in July 1995. With the introduction of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Act 1995 (Act No. 87 of 1995), which came into effect on July 1, 1995, some confusion arose as to the continuing eligibility of the Cement Industry in respect of its mining activities directed to the recovery of calcite or calcium. This legislation introduced a clause which excluded&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and this is the important point&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">sand, sandstone, soil, slate, clay (other than bentonite or kaolin) basalt, granite, gravel or water, or limestone (other than agricultural use limestone).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The insertion of limestone in the 1995 amendment, was intended to exclude limestone which was quarried but not to exclude limestone which was mined, where mining was undertaken in the pursuit of mineral recovery (calcite or calcium). The blanket exclusion of `limestone' has created unintentional and undue confusion. The intent was to clarify the quarrying issue.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I will come to this a little bit later. The situation with regard to the cement industry is that Customs has always contended&mdash;and indeed may well now, as a result of these amendments, contend&mdash;that they are quarrying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is the case that, although Customs have been fighting a losing battle in the courts with regard to this matter, and it seems to be getting more confused by the day&mdash;I think they are fighting a losing battle; I notice the minister nodded with regard to that&mdash;and they are now changing the course of their attack on the basis that if this legislation goes through they will say: `You might have won the battle with regard to the minerals mining test, but we are going to knock you over on the basis of the quarrying test, which we think you will not meet,' that provides a somewhat interesting set of circumstances. One would have to wonder about coalmining in so far as it relates to open-cut. The mining industry would be rather interested in such an interpretation of quarrying.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3580">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a company is mining limestone and then going for a process to extract a mineral which to all intents and purposes, as I understand it&mdash;and I will be very interested to hear whether my opinion is wrong&mdash;is not excluded by the list of other things that are described as not being minerals for the purposes of the legislation, it will be very interesting to see what sort of position the Minerals Council will adopt. I raised this question with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, when I asked some questions of you in the estimates you indicated that, should Customs lose their court processes, they would be paying. The information that is being conveyed to the cement industry appears to be: `We are still not going to pay you even if you win in the Federal Court because we will have this legislation up and we will knock you over on the basis of quarry.' I will be very interested to hear the minister's explanation of that when the times comes. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also ask you, Minister: even if at some point in time you win the argument about quarrying, will it also be the case that you will not be paying the cement industry retrospectively for those claims they had before this legislation became law?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the second reading speech on the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 the government proposes savings of $160 million. The bill does this by narrowing eligibility and excluding formerly claimable activities. It tightens administration and acts to close off claims allowed as a result of appeals to the AAT and the Federal Court. These changes will impact directly on the bottom line of most claimants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has not provided any analysis of the consequences of last year's budget cut in terms of industry viability, jobs, investment or exports. Nor am I aware of any government cost-benefit analysis of the diesel fuel rebate and its effect on the mining industry, regional economies and the broader economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the federal election campaign in February 1996 Senator Cheryl Kernot, leader of the Australian Democrats, said that if faced with a choice of cuts to essential services and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> budgets, particularly the environment, it would be wise to consider a package of cuts including to&mdash;and I quote&mdash;`reduce the energy inefficient diesel subsidies to the mining industry, subsidies which are worth over $800 million a year and which are not  available to industries such as tourism, services and manufacturing, all of which raise more export revenue than mining'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats recommended reducing the DFR for the mining industry during that election campaign. We recommended that it be reduced by 50 per cent, so achieving revenue savings of $400 million. This bill, by cutting the DFR by $160 million, meets 40 per cent of the target we set. Obviously we will therefore be supporting the bill for that reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats have three prime motivations for our policy. Firstly, we believe the mining industry has the capacity to substantially improve fuel efficiency by reducing its reliance on diesel, a move that would assist in reducing Australia's greenhouse emissions. Removing the rebate would make diesel less attractive on cost grounds. Secondly, we accept that there are limits to the budget capacity of government and in a climate of strong budget cuts and strong community demands the Australian Democrats believe it is appropriate for the mining industry to make this contribution to budget outlays. Thirdly, we believe that the DFR is an inefficient and inappropriate industry and export motivator. With regard to the first item, we recognise that, in trying to induce fuel efficiencies, there should be a carrot as well as a stick. Incentives could be considered to encourage a speedy switch for the mining industry out of diesel usage into energy usage, which delivers a better environmental outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the second item, budget needs are immediate and continue to be immediate. The coalition government and many business and economic commentators have advocated cuts to the DFR for budget reasons. The Australian Democrats recognise that investment in the mining industry often has a long lead time before the returns kick in. Investors in the mining industry frequently need to take a long-term view and for some 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3581"> current projects the DFR may be an important contributor to viability and the bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason, despite the fact that we support a reduction in DFR, we believe that it would be profoundly unfair to suddenly and significantly change the financial climate in which the industry operates. Accordingly, a graduated phased reduction would be preferable for industry financial planning. I am aware from the running sheet that the Greens (WA) will be putting up an amendment for a fast&hyphen;phase reduction but, in view of the comments I have just made, we will not be able to support that view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third item in our policy consideration relates to the inefficiency of the DFR as an export or industry motivational device. The ANAO picked up problems with the DFR scheme in the 1996 performance audit and recommended that the purpose and objective of the scheme be clarified. The government says that the primary purpose of the DFR is to maintain competitiveness in these key export industries. In this statement it did not say that the primary purpose is for government to refund or rebate moneys to which it is not entitled, and that is the argument of the mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are well aware that the mining industry strongly asserts that the DFR is not industry assistance but is a refund of diesel fuel excise which is not applicable  in specified circumstances. However, the rail industry, manufacturers and many exporters do not get the rebate and could mount similar arguments for it. They are paying a higher price for diesel which they, too, may use as a business input. Equitable principles would require the DFR to be provided across the board on a common basis to those with an equivalent export or industry case. Instead, the DFR is applied on a discriminatory basis. This discrimination in favour of the mining, fishing and farming industries clearly identifies the DFR as an assistance measure extended to select groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats, consequently, do consider the DFR to be an industry assistance measure. On that basis, its efficacy must be evaluated. Australian Democrat support for appropriate industry assistance is well doc 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> umented&mdash;including for assistance the coalition government has cut, such as DIFF, the 150 per cent R&amp;D tax allowance, the EMDG scheme and so on. The Australian Democrats believe that the DFR as applied is arbitrary, discriminatory, administratively complex and  poorly targeted. We believe that export motivation and industry assistance for the mining industry needs to be re-examined. That will require a re&hyphen;look at taxes, including those on inputs and outputs, and a re&hyphen;look at impediments to competitive exports by the mining industry. Well crafted change in these areas could well put the industry in an even better shape than it is currently even if the DFR were to be withdrawn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the existing tax and policy milieu, industry witnesses clearly stated that they would prefer government to raise taxes out of profits rather than to cut assistance measures, which affect costs. The Australian Democrats will therefore support a reduction in the total budget allocation for the DFR as proposed by the government, but we do believe that the proposed legislation needs amendment in terms of fairness and rationality within that broad budget constraint, and we have circulated amendments to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any further reduction in the DFR we believe should be laid out in advance by government on a phased and graduated basis so that the industries affected can proceed with sound financial planning. In terms of the arguments I outlined earlier, we accept that that should be done within the purview of an overall look at the tax system and competitive export assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are four ways in which the DFR could be applied by government to the mining industry&mdash;firstly, as a general rebate to the mining industry. This, we recognise, as does government, would result in a growing and open-ended budget cost. Both the present and the previous governments rejected this route, selectively restricting eligibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second way in which it could be applied by government to the mining industry is as a rebate selectively applied to favoured constituent parts of the mining industry. This system is currently in place. This restricts the total potential cost but it is still open-ended 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3582"> for those so favoured. In an attempt to hold down the budget cost, this bill increases the discrimination between those mining activities which attract the DFR and those which do not on a basis which does appear to us rather arbitrary and rather capricious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third way in which the DFR could be applied by government to the mining industry is as a capped amount. For this to work the rebate would have to be altered from a specified amount per litre of diesel used to a pro rata application of funds to all those eligible on the basis of funds available. This, in our view, is the best way of reducing the DFR on a known cost basis but of then being able to extend the scheme to all industry participants on a fair and non-discriminatory basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, the DFR could be applied by government to the mining industry as a targeted and specified industry assistance measure designed as a mechanism to grow mining, fishing or farming sectors or subsectors, or organisations which warranted special interventionist attention on sound economic and social grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Senate report came down, the majority report correctly summarised the discriminatory, arbitrary, complex and capricious way in which the DFR is being applied in the mining industry&mdash;and it was the same case, incidentally, with the previous government as well as with this bill. Changed definitions to mining operations and beneficiation have resulted in very considerable concern. The industry witnesses produced a telling list of mining processes and minerals which are illogically excluded from the present and proposed scheme. Land mining operations are favourably treated in comparison with sea mining operations. There appears to be no rational process for the inclusion of certain minerals in the scheme and the exclusion of others. Salt, mined limestone, petroleum, rutile and kaolin rank amongst the losers; copper, gold, uranium and alumina are amongst the winners. Natural gas is at a disadvantage compared with coal. In electricity generation, with regard to CO2 omissions natural gas plants are far preferable to coal fired plants, and we believe that natural gas should be supported.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These DFR changes will cut eligibility for a number of claimants who have been eligible for many years. We need to be cognisant of the possibility that these DFR changes could tip some operations into a loss making situation. Such operations may need a little time  to get their affairs in order. It would seem desirable, Minister, that any person or organisation which formerly operated at a profit and which will now operate at a loss solely because of the DFR changes should be able to appeal to you for special dispensation to claim for at least one further financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority report well summarises the evidence that the revised administrative arrangements will be too onerous. Witnesses advised that the proposed amendments would result in excessive compliance costs. In evidence, an AMEC witness read out a list of the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day DFR administrative problems consequent to the amendments. That submission would have been very funny if it was not so damning. For a government committed to reducing business compliance costs, this bill does not appear to do much for their cause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exclusion of some and the inclusion of others in the proposed amended DFR scheme is unfair and, in the opinion of many in the industry and its experts, is not determined on sound and defensible grounds. The government has quite properly determined to reduce the cost of the scheme and the levels of expenditure on it. Unfairness can only be eliminated by either capping the scheme and paying pro rata, as discussed above, or by limiting the payment very considerably to a few narrowly defined activities or by deliberately picking sectoral winners in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that the government, in its negotiations and intended resolution of this issue, has achieved an outcome which is unsatisfactory to many key industry constituents and it has to some extent lost their trust as a result. Industry witnesses spoke strongly to the economics committee concerning a breach of faith and a failure to honour agreements or a deal that they believed had been reached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn to prospectors, a small business group within the mining industry. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3583"> The Australian Democrats believe that prospectors undertake an essential, high risk and difficult task for the mining industry. It is also a major small business and entrepreneurial sector in the mining industry. The coalition government has already ended a tax exemption concession&mdash;paragraph 23(pa) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936&mdash;which did apply to prospectors. The government's decision in this bill to end the DFR for light vehicles under 3.5 tonnes gross weight is another hit at this small business sector. Light vehicles are the main off&hyphen;road item used in prospecting. It is our intention to move an amendment to correct this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now want to move to probably the only area which really affects farmers in our discussions and our amendments, and that is taking away the right to silence and the rights to appeal. The Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest</EMPHASIS> 1/97 identified a problem of civil liberties and natural justice. Item 25 of schedule 1 and item 10 of schedule 2 of this bill would insert proposed subsection 164AC(15) into the Customs Act 1901 and proposed subsection 78AD(15) into the Excise Act 1901. The committee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These sections refer to the powers of the Chief Executive Officer of Customs . . . to obtain information for the purposes of auditing a particular diesel fuel rebate application . . . These subsections, if enacted, would take away the right of a person to remain silent . . . that may result in the person incriminating himself or herself, thus exposing the person to prosecution for, and perhaps conviction of, a criminal offence. Taking away this right undoubtedly trespasses on personal rights and liberties. Whether it trespasses unduly on personal rights and liberties will depend on the context in which it is done. The issue is whether the advantage to the common good outweighs the loss to the individual of taking away the right to silence . . . The adverse effect of taking away the right to silence is partially mitigated by the protection included in the proposed subsections . . . The protection, however, is quite inadequate because it does not grant immunity from prosecution under paragraphs 234(1)(c) or (d) of the Customs Act 1901 or 120(1)(vc) or (vi) of the Excise Act 1901 in relation to the diesel fuel rebate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I and the Democrats are opposed in principle to the erosion of such rights. Citizens and organisations need safeguards against the power of the state. Many government entities, including Customs, have historically had to be reprimanded and constrained by the courts. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The other problem is a lack of rights to appeal some Customs and chief executive officer decisions. Customs is an organisation with considerable powers, sometimes exceeding those of the police. I do not accept that  there should be situations where Customs can be accuser, judge and executioner. I propose to introduce appropriate amendments for rights of appeal where they do not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Judging by the experience of the cement industry, as outlined in the hearings, one would be wise to be cautious of expecting Customs to always operate consistently and fairly. In the case of the cement industry, DFR claims are accepted at three sites and rejected at eight. I understand they are now going to be reviewed for the three that they were accepted at.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The economics committee did not hear from persons or organisations opposed to the DFR on policy grounds, which is a regret I have.

A review or change of these could affect diesel costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter has not been addressed by the committee. In October 1996 the Democrats raised in the Senate the problem of a major leakage and loss of diesel fuel at a mining site which may have been subsequently claimed for DFR. The minister's answer to the question, read in part, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that it is not possible to determine whether all or part of the diesel lost was, or was not, subject to rebate claim without an extensive search of both Customs and GEMCO's records, even then, a conclusive outcome may not result . . .

The amendments which I will be moving in the committee stages will set the basis for this revenue&hyphen;neutral option to the diesel fuel rebate for farmers in particular, for people in the bush.

We are putting a serious alternative to the people in the bush who do not have the cash in hand to  move towards an alternative like this, even though many of them may aspire to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a win&hyphen;win situation. It is based on similar schemes elsewhere in the world. For example, for many years the electricity authority in New Zealand made an interest&hyphen;free capital grant available to householders to insulate their homes. In return, the householders had diminished electricity bills which allowed them to pay off that capital loan quite rapidly. The electricity authority had spare electricity  which it could sell on to new buyers. That was a win&hyphen;win situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the United States, private corporations have gone further than that. In a move which is simple to understand, one private electricity utility has been handing out the new energy efficient light bulbs free to householders. These bulbs, which are eight times as efficient as the old bulbs, have allowed energy to be freed up and passed on to new buyers. That is energy efficiency. It takes a bit of lateral thinking, but it is a very wise way to be moving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put this idea of a sun fund for the bush very seriously: people can take up this option which, besides helping with the capital investment up front, will mean that over the coming years&mdash;ad infinitum&mdash;they will not be paying any diesel fuel bills for electricity production. It is a very exciting and positive alternative. It fits in very much with the world's aspiration to reduce greenhouse gases. It also fits in very much with the stimulation of sunrise industries which this country should be at the forefront in assisting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not small pickles. If we look at the rural sector which this fund is aimed at, if all those farms were to convert their electricity production from the current diesel generation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3586"> to solar alternatives, the energy displacement would be equivalent to 600 megawatts. Six hundred megawatts is equivalent to half the total potential output of Tasmania's hydro&hyphen;electric system&mdash;the 39 dams in Tasmania. It is a big domestic market. So the third component of the good news about this option is that it would be a tremendous stimulus to those Australian businesses&mdash;not least small businesses, which are labour intensive businesses&mdash;which are at the forefront of technological innovation for energy production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government wins, the farmers win and the sunrise energy production industries win as well. I hope the government will consider very seriously the amendments which I will be putting forward, because there is a great opportunity to have something very positive and green come out of this legislation. The government likes to say that the Greens oppose the proposals it brings forward and that they have a negative viewpoint. While I disagree with that, here is a great opportunity for the government to be positive, to follow its own line of thinking and to take up an alternative which has everybody in the community winning and which will do a great deal to enhance the government's own image both with environmentalists and with people in the bush.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are discussing the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 (No. 2). The bill gives effect to the 1996&hyphen;97 budget announcement of the government, and its intention is to amend the diesel fuel rebate legislation. The fact that we have the government's first budget legislation now  overlapping with the government's second budget is a fair indication of the sort of log jam this Senate is facing and of the obstructionism this government is facing in the Senate. The guilty party is sitting across the other side on the Greens benches.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best example of their obstructionism was only about a fortnight ago when we had the delay to the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill. You would have thought that that bill&mdash;which was doing no more than setting up a billion dollar trust for the good of the environment&mdash;would have been rushed through this chamber with the support of all the parties in the Senate. But the Green senators vexatiously and frivolously delayed it, simply on the grounds of politics. They were very fearful that, with this government on the front foot on the environment, it would put their party out of business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In discussing this bill, I cannot help but mention the previous three speakers. I was amused by Senator Murphy's detailed and studied contribution. He went in to bat to defend the very industries he has spent a career&mdash;particularly under his union hat, let alone his senatorial position at the moment&mdash;pulling down: the mining and forestry industry, to say nothing of the farmers. In his contribution he even said something in the defence of the farmers. Of course, his party, when in government, spent 13 years&mdash;each budget&mdash;ratcheting up petrol taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was followed by the Democrat Senator Murray. I tried to understand the scheme that he put forward; I really made an effort. He himself admitted that it was complex, and he is dead right about that. It seemed to be a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3587"> scheme that brought in more restriction, yet also broadened the scheme, to use his words. It broadened and restricted. Isn't that typical of the Democrats? There is something for all. I suggest that the mining industry or any of the industries that at present have the advantage of the diesel fuel rebate study Senator Murray's scheme and not fall for it, because, as usual, it has not only the gloss of the Democrat fairness on it but also the complexity and the uselessness that the Democrats bring to this particular debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we all had a good laugh at Senator Brown from the Greens party when he seriously suggested that we have sun&hyphen;powered tractors. This is very relevant to the debate, isn't it! This legislation contains a billion dollar&hyphen;plus scheme to tighten up eligibility and that wacky Senator Brown walks in here and suggests that the farmers would do well to have sun&hyphen;powered tractors.

But we all had a good laugh and we did not take it at all seriously, Senator Brown, if you thought for one fleeting moment that we did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Getting to the essence of the scheme before us, which escaped the speakers before me, the scheme does provide rebates of excise or customs duty on diesel fuel purchased for specific off&hyphen;road users mainly in the mining, agricultural, fishing and forestry operations. The figures from 1994&hyphen;95 show that there were some 213,000 claims involving some $1.25 billion.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme is pretty clear. There is no mystery to it, as defined by the Australian National Audit Office. The bill gives effect to the government's intention to achieve savings in the scheme by tightening eligibility and containing growth in the outlays. This particular intention is endorsed by the audit office, which recommended that the purpose and objectives of the scheme be somewhat clarified, and that a range of measures be introduced to improve accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the government's explanatory memorandum, the amendments fall into three  broad categories. The first excludes from mining operations the eligibility for rebate in respect of nearly all light vehicles and certain off&hyphen;road activities. Further amendments restricting eligibility relate to sea transport, off&hyphen;site rail, sea and public road use and quarrying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second broad amendment has the effect of counteracting the effect of certain AAT and Federal Court decisions, specifically the Dampier Salt decision. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser), said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The particular amendments will ensure the continuation of rebate for diesel fuel used in carrying out mining activities but will preclude from eligibility certain activities, best described as undertaken for economic/marketing reasons, rather than the physical extraction of minerals, and activities which essentially involve the transport of inputs/materials for mining or beneficiation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As the audit office requested, that certainly does clearly define the purpose of the diesel fuel rebate, if there is indeed any doubt at all. In relation to the Dampier Salt case, the concern of the government was that the interpretation had the potential to substantially widen the eligibility under the scheme. On this matter, the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The full Federal Court's judgment is considered to be the most far reaching ever delivered in relation to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. It represents a fundamental shift from a scheme based on the concept of an activity (in this case mining) being regarded as a physical act (that is the extraction of a product from the ground) to a concept of the activity being an economic one.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The third broad based amendment relates to accountability and administration. In his second reading speech, the minister said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3588">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A range of amendments are proposed which will improve accountability requirements, assist in enabling a clamp down on misuse of the scheme and improve its administration.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I will not go into too much detail on the third amendments. Given the strict time which we government members are under, I would like to jump to the main point, which relates to the defence of the diesel fuel rebate. It is so often under attack from those on the other side of the house and from many out in the community. We know from those on the other side of the house that, if they could have abolished the scheme in their time in government, they would have. We know they tried&mdash;but failed&mdash;in their last budget to place a one per cent levy on the administration cost, which would have raised around $12 million, which is about the cost of the administration of this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has no plans to introduce such a levy or to fundamentally change the diesel fuel rebate. We know just how much the major export industries&mdash;the mining industry and the rural sector&mdash;depend on this scheme and how important it is to their competitiveness to reduce input costs. Why should these two major export schemes not have the advantage of the diesel fuel rebate? The mining industry exports $33 billion a year and claims only some $750 million a year&mdash;a very low percentage in regard to the diesel fuel rebate. The rural industry exports $21 billion a year and claims around the $400 million mark, which is a very small price for the government coffers in respect of supporting, giving incentives to and lowering input costs for these major export industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Farmers Federation, a staunch defender of the diesel fuel rebate&mdash;as are the National Party in government; and Senator Crane, from Western Australia, who knows only too well the importance of the diesel fuel rebate to his state&mdash;submitted a very extensive report on the importance of the diesel fuel rebate to the farming sector. Part of that report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the two decade period, consumption has grown on average by about 2.4% per annum. This would, in part, be due to substitution of diesel for petrol&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">with&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the wider availability of diesel powered vehicles and equipment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">such as four&hyphen;wheel drives and grain harvesters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the same period, the area sown to grain has risen by about 3 million ha, about 25% in total, an average annual growth of 1.1% in the area sown to grain.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The relationship of that to the diesel fuel rebate scheme is that it is an important factor in supplying, and giving incentive to, the expansion of the rural sector. In the mining  sector, we need only to look at two industries. The Minerals Council has submitted a paper in regard to the importance of this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will pick out two major export industries. The first is the major export industry&mdash;the coal industry. The paper says that, should the scheme be abolished, it would have an effect on the coal industry. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . cancellation in the Rebate will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> increase input costs by about $1 a tonne for coal with no ability to pass the cost increase on to customers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For the coal industry, which is the most competitive industry, particularly with exports to Japan, any increase in cost almost means death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second industry that would be most affected is the gold industry. The paper says that the abolition of the diesel fuel rebate would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">significantly increase the input costs of Australia's gold industry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">particularly in remote areas where diesel is a major fuel source with virtually no likelihood of alternative fuel sources such as electricity or gas due to the remoteness of mines from the national grids. This has the potential to impact on low grade mining operations. For example, for the remote mine of Telfer in Western Australia, abolition of the Rebate would require the mine head grade to improve by over 70% to maintain mining income.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is fairly significant in respect of the importance of the scheme. In conclusion, the amendments that the government is bringing to this scheme to tighten its eligibility are necessary and creditable while maintaining our commitment to the scheme.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this debate I wish to briefly address the following issues arising out of the bill: firstly, the impact on the goldmining and exploration activities in Western Australia through the removal of the DFR for light vehicles less than 3.5 tonnes; secondly, the adequacy of the financial impact statements; thirdly, the somewhat confused and apparently contradictory position of industry participants in this debate; and fourthly, particular industries that are affected by this bill and recent amendments circulated by the government. I refer here to the salt industry and concerns of major organisations like the Minerals Council, AMEC and APPEA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn firstly to the impact on the goldmining and exploration activities through the removal of the diesel fuel rebate for light vehicles. It is critical to understand at the outset how the mining exploration industry and its people work. It is a quintessential, risk driven industry. It comprises individuals, small groups and small companies. A feature of this industry is high risk at the outset and continuing high risk, often over many years. It requires initial raising of capital. This capital funds exploration and continuing exploration. That exploration is carried out in both brown field and green field sites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Brown field sites are existing geological formations, and exploration tends to follow trends of possible or potential mineral deposits. Green field sites are pure exploration. It is increasingly done by radio beams from satellites which identify particular mineral formations under the ground. In either green field or brown field sites, actual physical follow&hyphen;up is required. This involves soil sampling, pit exploration, geological surveying, site marking and site identification.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These activities all require four-wheel drive vehicles to carry out physical work. The cost of the diesel fuel is critical to that exploration process. The removal of the rebate is thus a high cost impost to the early exploration and identification work conducted by individuals and small end mining companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The process of exploration, initial capital raising and physical checking is high risk and very expensive. As the process continues and potential sites are identified, the value of that  site increases. This outcome is used as the incentive to raise further additional capital through placement of additional shares. This then funds further exploration, building up the further value in potential sites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Western Australia in the goldmining areas, the gold ratio is higher than for other minerals. Hence, the removal of the rebate is an attack on the gold exploration industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One asks the obvious question: what are the attributes of individual geologists and prospectors involved in this industry? They are highly educated, small business people or often battlers, entrepreneurial in outlook and risk takers by nature. The removal of this rebate is thus an attack on the backbone of this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in summary on this aspect of the debate, I would submit that this industry employs many people from this battler sector and many people who are generally entrepreneurial in their outlook; it is a high risk industry with any return many years in the future; the process of capital raising is critical to fund exploration, which is the heart of the industry; the only government concession is the diesel fuel rebate; the removal of this rebate for light vehicles less than 3&half; tonnes directly attacks the cash flow of all in this industry; the prospectors' main tool of trade is their four&hyphen;wheel drive vehicle used extensively in remote off-road situations in the search for minerals; any extra cost associated with the use of four&hyphen;wheel drive vehicles will impact upon exploration activities; and the consequences of the removal of the DFR will be to limit exploration, make capital raising more difficult and restrict the comparative advan 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3590"> tage of the Western Australian goldmining industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the financial impact statements. As is customary in the EM, there is a financial impact statement. The form of the FIS in this EM is no different from that prepared for other bills. At best, it is a most cursory document. On page 7, paragraph (a) simply identifies savings of around $35 million in the mining operations category. Paragraph (b) says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments are designed to contain expansion in the Scheme and not designed to achieve savings. Failure to introduce these changes however could result in additional outlays of up to $100m per annum.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Paragraph (c) refers to :</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . amendments to improve accountability under the Scheme and its administration.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Savings of around $25m per annum are estimated from these measures.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the assertions of savings of millions of dollars are made. The government chooses to provide no supporting evidence of how these figures were determined, the method of calculation, the detail of any cost&hyphen;benefit analysis that may have been carried out, whether any cost&hyphen;benefit analysis was carried out and which department or agency did this job, and whether any figures were the subject of review by either Treasury or the Department of Finance. My suspicion is that the figure grossly underestimates the amount of savings, particularly with reference to paragraphs (a) and (b) on page 7 of the financial impact statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, in the budget the government announced that, whilst the DFR scheme would be tightened, it would remain. The budget figure costed savings to outlays of $441 million over four years. This can be contrasted with the EM, which proposed a financial impact of $60 million per year, or $240 million over four years, plus $100 million per annum in savings. If these two savings in the explanatory memorandum are added, the saving is really $406 million over the four&hyphen;year period. So two different documents show alternatively a saving of $441 million or $640 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million over four years. At best, it is fair to conclude that the government is confused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue of exactness of financial figures was raised in the additional estimates. It was raised in the Economics Legislation Committee's consideration of the current bill. Indeed, Senator Cook specifically asked the government a series of questions. A particular question was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Has the government conducted any cost benefit analysis or is it aware of any cost benefit analysis conducted by a reputable non&hyphen;government agency or private sector consultancy into the impact of  federal government taxes and charges in the mining sector?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government on 6 May responded to these questions with the simple response of `No'. So in arriving at its costings and savings, the government did not carry out any cost&hyphen;benefit analysis and is still not aware of any such analysis being conducted by any private sector agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So at the end of the day the Senate is requested to add an impost on industry or make a savings to forward outlays of between $441 million and $640 million over a four&hyphen;year period. At best, these two parameter figures are dubious and more likely to be a back&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;envelope consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the government refuses to provide any of the relevant financial information to the Senate. This is a matter for concern because it goes to the question of financial responsibility, accountability and transparency. These are all matters addressed by the government in its charter of budget honesty and it is about time they were put into practice in bills presented to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now wish to turn to the apparently confused position of industry and government in this debate. The minority report outlines the apparent position reached between government and industry on this bill. The minority report makes the following points. Firstly, the basis of the bill is an agreement struck between a high&hyphen;level group and a government negotiating committee. Secondly, that government committee comprised the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Prosser, and on occasions Senator Parer. Thirdly, that agreement was the result of a negotiation exercise carried out by the high&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3591">level group, broadly representative of the mining industry and the Commonwealth. Fourthly, that agreement attempted to resolve from the Commonwealth's perspective the issues of growth and budget costs of rebate due to unintended claims, and from the high&hyphen;level group's position the industry objectives of certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This agreement of course is most critical. There are different views on the nature of the agreement and different final documents from the high&hyphen;level group and the government. Notwithstanding these differences, the following is clear: the high&hyphen;level group, on behalf of industry, intended to concede areas that may have been held to be areas of legitimate claim, thus confining the scope of the rebate quite tightly in exchange for an agreement from the government not to put a cap on claims in the remaining legitimate areas of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry associations testified that the bill explicitly dishonours the agreement reached. These disagreements go to: the inclusion of the salt industry; the definition of beneficiation where it is involved; and the involvement of the cement industry without its apparent knowledge or support. Details of that confused position are outlined at paragraph 13 of the minority report. This is indeed a most unsatisfactory conclusion, the result of an industry process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition does not wish to be particularly difficult on this aspect of the debate. Normally industry&hyphen;government agreements are to be applauded and are a powerful indicator to the legislature. Normally it should and would be supported by the opposition. However, subject to any comments to be made later by Senator Parer, it is not proper at this stage to offer any further comment than to simply point out the apparent inconsistencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning fourthly to particular industries, I refer specifically to the salt industry in Western Australia. It is the opposition's view that this matter needs to be resolved with the industry. The amount of their savings identified in figures provided to the Economics References Committee and in the EM is of the order of $600,000 per annum. The issue of that saving arises from the use of a dry 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stockpile in the mining of that particular product. My understanding is that the concern of the government is for flow into other areas, presumably the iron ore industry and other large extraction type industries in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inclusion of Dampier Salt from Western Australia and the limitation of their existing right to claim the rebate has a wholly unsatisfactory and unsavoury flavour. The high&hyphen;level group never claimed to have authority to negotiate and conclude a bargain  on their behalf. The likely saving to the  Commonwealth of $600,000 per annum is a fairly heavy impost on a commodity extraction and export oriented export firm and industry. It is really a tax on the productive inputs of the salt industry. To the extent that it affects the price received for the end product, it is quite inefficient. It is also, by definition, an unworthy slug on a Western Australian based mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The solution, if the government is of a mind, is fairly simple and straightforward. It is simply to circulate an amendment to the effect that nothing contained in the bill shall affect the current entitlement of Dampier Salt Pty Ltd in respect of their location in a particular site in Western Australia. Indeed, the real criticism of the proposed amendment to the definition of beneficiation is that it unfairly discriminates against salt producers relative to other mining operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to recent amendments of the Commonwealth. During the Senate inquiry Senator Parer announced further amendments to the bill. They are now tabled in the Senate. The Minerals Council of Australia has advised of a number of concerns. In its correspondence of 19 March it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minerals Council's support for the amendments is qualified by the statement that any suggestion of the introduction of a cap on expenditure in the diesel fuel rebate scheme or any increase in diesel fuel excise would be seen as a breach of faith of the industry/government High Level Group agreement and opposed by the industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In particular, the Minerals Council goes on to point out the discriminatory treatment meted out to Dampier Salt in Western Australia by singling out particular company activities 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3592"> unfairly. The Minerals Council is correct to point out that the amendments could have unintended consequences for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, a technically satisfactory way of drying and cleaning the salt exists. The passage of the bill may force the company to consider a more inefficient way of stockpiling to retain the rebate of $600,000 per annum. Similarly, AMEC is correct to point out that the structure of the legislation is flawed. As it identifies, the bill does not provide for complete coverage for all activities in a mining operation. Thus, it is to be regretted because, again, it has the capacity to introduce inefficiencies in planning, layout and production processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In cost terms, an inefficient or technically backward method of production or value adding may be referred to a mining company because of a rebate entitlement, whilst the more advanced, efficient or technically competent process may be jettisoned. This flawed approach really penalises those companies committed to innovation, product development and process improvement and has the real capacity to retard the ongoing introduction of state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art technology. It is a regrettable example of public policy restraining the potential growth of leading edge and world-class firms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, it would be useful for the mining industry to have had some certainty for the future. There seems little rationale for the bill except cost savings. The process entered by the high&hyphen;level group and the Commonwealth seems to have had a worthwhile objective, if not a confused outcome. The DFR does appear to be the subject of a somewhat complex and cumbersome application. Capricious interference through the customs department seems to be accepted as a norm. One can only shudder at how this impacts upon industry planning. As Senator Murray outlined in his minority report at page 39:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There appears to be no rational process for the inclusion of certain minerals in the scheme and the exclusion of others. Salt, mined limestone, petroleum, rutile and kaolin rank amongst the losers. Copper, gold, uranium and alumina are winners. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In conclusion, I would recommend that both the Commonwealth and the high&hyphen;level group reactivate the negotiation process and that process concentrate on what they have identified as their core interests. In that way the diesel fuel rebate may survive as a legitimate business input cost and not be the subject of errant classification as business assistance or business subsidies by minority parties like the Australian Democrats.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 (No. 2) deals with the diesel rebate for mining. It  should be noted that there are effectively three diesel rebate schemes: the rebate for mining, that for farmers and pastoralists&mdash;in fact, all non-primary producers, including fishing and forestry&mdash;and the one for residential power use in remote areas, including some remote communities. This bill only relates to the mining rebate. I would like to make it clear that the Greens (WA) have quite different attitudes towards the various types of rebate. The amendments here really relate to what kinds of mining attract a rebate and which do not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the inevitable lobbying whenever we deal with the diesel rebate scheme, various interests have pushed for extensions of the mining rebate. While the Greens support the agri&hyphen;pastoral rebates, we do not support the rebate for mining. We will be putting forward amendments to phase that out. In line with that attitude, the Greens (WA) generally resisted extensions of the mining rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our approach has been to adjudge what is just and fair. For example, we opposed a retrospective extinction of the rebate a few years ago, although we were quite happy to support a prospective extinction of them and told the mining lobby so. In this debate, however, some miners have complained of injustice on the basis of various principles of what mining is. In our opinion, there are no real principles in operation about what is included and excluded in this bill. It is based on arbitrary decisions, regardless of what people indicate in speeches or statements.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3593">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A certain amount of effort is being put in to try to define mineral as based on the need for extraction of something called a mineral from something else, which might be called an ore. Whilst this has a certain logic, it is not what this act says. `Mining for minerals' as a phrase does not imply this any more than `prospecting for minerals' or `exploration for minerals' does. The phrase `mining for minerals' occurs precisely where it is meant that mining, exploration and prospecting are all included in the definition of a mining activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the definition of mineral that is critical, but not usefully provided. The definition that does appear simply says that it could be a mineral as solid, liquid or gas and then excludes sand, water, clay, soil, gravel and other elements, which implies that they would have been included without this exclusion. By example, we have been approached on the basis that mining involves extraction of a mineral and that extraction of a mineral is, or should be, therefore, mining; that where such an extraction occurs it is not just to exclude an extractive industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this is not the principle in law. Coal is not extracted from an ore. It is just dug up and used in that form. It is quarried under the stated principle. It is not a mineral in the sense that it is not constant or homogeneous. It varies with the pattern of vegetative decay in its formation, yet it is covered. Salt is not extracted from an ore. It is covered, although obviously we have some issues there. Limestone quarrying is not covered. Yet it is covered, but only where the limestone goes to farmers. This is not a principled system. It is an arbitrary one. Things are specified as either in or out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this regard, we do not feel that we are obliged to extend the rebate to cement producers. We do not feel obliged to extend the rebate to tenders for offshore rigs. The government and the Senate can or not as they like. There are no principles under which groups are being treated unjustly. They are simply excluded. Others are simply included. We might argue about whether we wish to include or exclude them, but no-one is in by right. The principle here seems to be that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> these are generally extractive industries involved in extracting non-renewable resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should we subsidise depletion of non-renewable resources? What is so special about them that we want to pay to have resources taken away? In many cases&mdash;bauxite, mineral sands, iron ore, gold&mdash;we have large portions of the world's economically recoverable deposits. Why do we need to provide special assistance for others to use it? Surely it is madness to build our economy on extraction of non-renewable resources? Surely it is counterproductive to fail to maximise our return for something the world wants, which is present in limited quantities. I say this  without raising the question of what these limited resources are used for and what planetary impacts occur as a result of subsidising consumption and waste of our physical resource heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we decide to use subsidies to promote the economy and jobs, why subsidise this industry? What goals is the government seeking to achieve? If it is employment, this is certainly a low employment industry per unit of investment. How is government or taxpayer largess distributed and on what basis? Manufacturers do not get a diesel subsidy for transporting their goods or running a generator or whatever. Why is that? What is the justice of that? Which employers are subsidised and why?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There seems to be little rationale and little justice here. It is simply a decision that the previous government made and the coalition went along with it&mdash;or sort of. Where is the debate and the rationale about what kinds of industries we want and what industries are best able to meet communities' wants and needs? These are social and economic decisions, the kinds of decisions many people still expect a responsible government to consider. They are political decisions, and ones that look beyond how governments can assist big corporations to maximise profits. This kind of debate has largely disappeared in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be sharing in a community vision of a more socially and ecologically sustainable future. But, instead, we have a great policy abyss, which is the result of a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3594"> blind belief by government of the international free market ideology. The Greens (WA) disagree with the emphasis that puts international competitiveness above all other values. There are other choices, such as increased regional self-reliance, less dependence on low-value exports, more import replacement, more industries involved in value adding&mdash;all within a context of sustaining the ecology, finding solutions to global problems, improving social amenity, more efficient use of energy and resources and, particularly, more reliance on renewable energy, reduced use of non-renewable resources and reduced use of renewable resources, especially where they are being used close to, or beyond, their rate of renewal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The human impact on this planet is increasing logarithmically. For most of human history, natural forces dwarfed or overrode human activity. But from the point where we learned to use tools and precipitated Pleistocene overkill, a large number of the large species present at that time were wiped out. Human agricultural and logging activity in other areas resulted in significant desertification in northern Africa, the Tigris-Euphrates, and the south&hyphen;western deserts of the United States&mdash;all occurring over 2,000 years ago.

Major global petroleum experts estimate that global oil production is peaking and will soon decline and become markedly more expensive. This is a major threat to providing the food to sustain a population where millions of people each year already die from a lack of food. In part, this translates to the lack of ability to afford food and the lack of resources to produce their own food in sufficient quantities. We already see famine creating a class of environmental refugees and interacting with conflict within and between nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been about 35 years since Rachel Carson wrote <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Silent Spring</EMPHASIS>, Von Forster published his population article and, generally, environmental issues attained prominence. Green thinking has really developed from that point. It is 25 years since the Tasmanian Greens became the world's first green party. Since then, we have seen green parties with the same core values arise in many nations around the world and at all levels of political activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to those who claim that the greens want people to starve in the cold and dark, it is clear to anyone examining green thought that most greens are not Luddites or misanthropes. The basic premise of green thinking is that we must look open&hyphen;eyed at the future and adapt ourselves, create limits for ourselves and develop technological and social structures that will allow all people&mdash;and their children, grandchildren and great&hyphen;great&hyphen;grandchildren&mdash;to live in relative harmony with each other and nature; to have what they need to form rich lives; and to foster a peaceful, tolerant and more equitable society, one in which all members of the community take an active part in determining the social frameworks for our future. This is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the meaning of the four pillars of green politics; that is, ecological sustainability, social equity, peace and participatory democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For decades now green thinkers have proposed solutions and pointed to the technologies that would enable us to retain a developed way of life without destroying the life systems, biodiversity and beauty of the world around us. Often these were ways that would require a major re&hyphen;orientation and commitment&mdash;including capital commitment&mdash;but which would result in transformations that would see us better off, with more options and lower ultimate maintenance costs. It is difficult to re&hyphen;orient the direction of sociotechnical development. The greens have been cognisant of that and have stressed the need to act early, phase in and make the transition as easy as possible. We have stressed the need for urgent action, in part to reduce the costs of transition. We have said again and again that if we wait until we are forced by events to address these problems, the costs will be horrendous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now see the outcome in relation to greenhouse emissions. After years and years of Australian governments ignoring the calls to create a viable policy, after years of pursuing policies to attract energy intensive industries without addressing the need to come up with cleaner energy sources, the current government is now trying to undermine the global response to greenhouse and, in case that fails, it is trying to claim exemption on the basis that we should be pitied because we use too much energy, and it would cost us money to do our part, so we shouldn't need to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this regard, we will put an amendment to end the subsidy of energy use to fuel the cheap use of non&hyphen;renewable resources. We have options in this country other than digging it up, cutting it down or killing it and shipping it all away and seeing the profits shipped away with it by the transnationals that own these mainly low&hyphen;labour, low&hyphen;employment industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we want to provide public subsidies to industry, I would like to see us move towards creating a sustainable energy industry here. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3596"> We could vastly improve our impacts on the planet in the process. But, guess what? In the budget a substantial chunk was cut from the Energy Research and Development Corporation funding, and the national energy efficiency program is being wound up&mdash;tiny amounts compared with the massive handouts to some of our largest energy consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a future for sustainable energy, for devices that make use of sun, wind, tide and co&hyphen;generation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another entire market for making goods that allow energy to be conserved and used efficiently.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to speak in this debate on the issue of cement in particular because of the interest in Queensland in the mining of limestone. Limestone, of course, is used predominantly in the cement manufacturing, flux and smelting of lead and copper. The industry is not an insignificant contributor to the Australian economy: it employs 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some 2,600 people, has fixed assets of over a billion dollars and a tax on profit last year, I believe, of in excess of $62 million. The industry mines limestone for the sole purpose of recovering the mineral calcite, or calcium, from what is a naturally occurring raw material.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry enjoyed the diesel fuel rebate, as we have heard already in this debate, prior to legislation in July 1995. However, arising out of legislation in that year there was confusion as to the application of the DFR to certain industries. That was later clarified by the then Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction in a letter dated 9 August 1995. The letter, in part, says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . rebate is no longer payable on diesel fuel purchased on or after 1 July 1995 for use in the extraction of limestone per se, as the law now  clearly excludes limestone, amongst other things, from the definition of `minerals'. However, the law continues to allow rebate to be paid where an activity can be said to be `mining for minerals' and does not simply constitute the extraction of the now excluded materials.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It went on&mdash;and this is the crux of the letter:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, the legal test is whether the activities of a claimant are carried out with a view to recovering from the limestone ore, a mineral or minerals such as calcium carbonate (or calcite). If this is the case, then the rebate is payable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst there was some comfort gained from that, with the change of government there was a further item of correspondence, which was referred to in the debate earlier this evening, dated 16 October from the current Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Prosser. It is most confusing because it says that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most quarrying materials previously eligible for diesel fuel rebate became ineligible on 1 July 1995. The only materials presently eligible are limestone for use in de&hyphen;acidification of soil in agriculture and materials from which the mineral content is extracted, such as rutile.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Therein lies the dilemma&mdash;just in that letter itself. Really, the cement miners maintain that there is an extraction process anyway from the limestone and it should therefore attract and retain the diesel fuel rebate. The minister's letter went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the government is presently considering further changes in eligibility, particularly in the mining sector, these are directed at containing eligibility. Budget 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3597"> circumstances preclude consideration of proposals to widen eligibility or re&hyphen;instate activities which may have received the rebate previously.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What we have is a debate about whether or not limestone used in cement should attract the DFR and, if so, whether it is proper that these people should receive the DFR. I believe this has been subject to court action and the courts are currently trying to deal with it. Whilst the courts are still trying to deal with this issue we now have legislation before the Senate which seeks to exclude these people from any further chance of accessing the DFR.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look at the inquiry conducted by the Economics Legislation Committee into this particular legislation. It clearly establishes there the confusion that reigns. In the minority report my colleagues have clearly outlined the position and, for posterity, it is worth going through some of those key points. Point No. 6 in the minority report says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Inquiry has revealed that the actual basis for this Bill is an Agreement struck between a High Level Group (HLG) and a Government negotiating committee . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So that was the basis, we are led to believe from this report,  of the legislation that is before us. As you read down in the minority report, at point No. 9 one sees that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of the Industry Associations testified that the Bill explicitly dishonoured the agreement reached.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Here we have a breakdown between the industry group and the government. As my colleague, Senator Bishop, said before, this is a most unfortunate aspect of what has taken place in this particular case. The report goes on to talk about the areas in dispute:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there remain areas of continuing dispute. For example, the Government contends that the Industry agreed in the HLG that the Salt Industry would not be included in the rebate. Industry strongly reject this. They claim that their position has always been that the Salt Industry is entitled to remain eligible.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further down it talks about government involvement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Minister for Customs unilaterally and without consultation, with the industry varied the Agreement . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">No wonder there is dissatisfaction. No wonder there are problems with this piece of legisla 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion that the government has brought here on this occasion. Point No. 12 in the minority report says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the HLG appears to have been broadly representative of mining interests, it did not represent, nor did it purport to represent the Cement Industry.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That point further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the concern of the Cement Industry to continue to be eligible to claim the rebate has been set aside by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That sets the framework in which this legislation has appeared in this chamber. It is interesting to note that the conclusion drawn in the minority report says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that the Cement Industry mine limestone in order to break down that raw material and obtain Calcinite as a key ingredient in the manufacture of cement.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also clear that this industry has previously had an entitlement to receive the rebate. That entitlement is on hold at the present time because of legal action to reassert it in the face of the withdrawal of the rebate by Customs from some, not all, Cement operations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that Customs, on learning that some cement operations received the rebate, indicated to the Committee that it would withdraw the entitlement from all Cement companies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is like saying: `We are now going to take our bat and ball and stumps and go off, and that is your bad luck; you will have to play on the field without any equipment.' The minority report says at point 7:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would appear that the Customs decision with respect to the Cement Industry has been spurred by the obligation placed on it by the Government to make savings in the scheme rather than the Cement Industry's right to eligibility.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the real nub of this debate. It seems to be about a disagreement between the government and the industry. It seems that the cement industry are finding themselves out on a limb. In the face of real challenges to their industry, they are seeking to claw back something which makes their industry viable. This is supported in their submission to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. It is worthwhile noting, looking at the degree of expenditure over a 10-year period in my state alone, that some $26 million has been invest 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3598"> ed by Queensland Cement Ltd in Gladstone in the processing and manufacture of cement. The Cement Industry Federation's submission says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The potential for surplus capacity in the South East Asian region over the coming years will expose the Australian Cement Industry to the threat of placement of larger quantities of imported cement. Existing anti-dumping legislation in Australia will not serve to protect the domestic industry in the event that Asian economies can produce cement at a lower cost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any additional imposts make the task all the more difficult. The potential loss of the diesel fuel rebate further increases the load and widens the competitive gap between Australia and our South East Asian competitors.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clearly, this is about the viability of a major industry in my state. I did at the outset outline that there are $1 billion of assets in this industry, which employs more than 2,600 people Australia-wide. So we are not talking about a small employer or a small industry. If there were a competitive edge that gave this industry a degree of viability, it was access to the diesel fuel rebate. They seem to have been excluded in the debate to a substantial extent by the HLG itself and also by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So these people have, in my view, a real gripe and a real axe to grind with the government on this legislation. The government has not thought this out well. It is patchy at best. It is about time the government took a close look at the impact of this legislation, stopped trying to pick winners in this game&mdash;whether it be the mining industry or the farming industry&mdash;and looked at doing something positive for the maintenance of the competitiveness of the cement industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look further at the views as outlined in the letter by the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies to members of the Senate, which piece of correspondence says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AMEC believes however that the legislation still does not go far enough.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, this is after there has been a supposed consultation between the HLG and the government and those people who may well have been disaffected by the govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment's decision. The letter then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AMEC seeks your assistance in this matter so as to ensure that the reduction in the mining industry's eligibility to access the DFRS is limited only to those items listed in the agreement reached in the high level negotiations last year. Until that time it is our view that the CELA Bill (No. 2) 1996 is a breach of the agreement and will have a significant negative impact on the international competitiveness of the Australian mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Surely the government is going to take note of that sort of plea coming out of industry. They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government has indeed not kept faith with the mining industry in that, following the agreement, it sought to attain its objectives by stealth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Nothing can be more damning than those words coming out of AMEC, which obviously has a great interest in seeing that the DFR is applied equitably throughout the mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in summary, I believe that what I have put to the chamber here this evening warrants the government not pursuing its current legislation. In Senator McGauran's contribution to the debate he talked about how important the mining industry was. He talked about any increase in costs being the death knell of the industry. I can only echo and support those words because I think in that respect he is quite correct. Justice has to be done for the cement industry. The DFR has to be reinstated so that the cement industry can remain competitive in the Australian marketplace and can continue to operate as a major contributor to the Australian economy and, in particular, to the Queensland economy.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in this second reading debate on the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996, which I suppose euphemistically could be described as the diesel fuel rebate scheme debate. I rise to speak not at any length. It is not my area of shadow ministry responsibility, but I could not help but become involved by saying a few words in this debate as a former customs minister in the previous government who dealt with this scheme and made recom 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3599"> mendations in I think the 1995 budget about changes to the diesel fuel rebate scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I proposed certain changes, which were very modest compared with what this government is putting up today as far as the effect on expenditure is  concerned&mdash;it was a few hundred thousand dollars in some cases or a few million dollars in other cases&mdash;I do not think that in any particular area did I propose changes that were to rake in tens of millions of dollars or hundreds of millions of dollars in expenditure in relation to the diesel fuel rebate scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was one particular aspect for which I sought support from the Senate: the need for some retrospective legislation to stop an appeal by three major construction companies in Australia&mdash;CRA, Boral and Pioneer&mdash;who were claiming between them, as a result of an AAT determination, up to about $80 million going back to 1986 or 1987. This was a real try-on. I asked the Senate to support legislation so that these companies would not be able to claim that. They had already spent the money in running the projects. They had already paid for the diesel. This was a try-on by some consultants who said to them, `If we win this case, give us our percentage cut,' which I imagine would have been quite sizeable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I proposed that in this Senate, I was roundly attacked by National and Liberal Party members for doing something outrageous in relation to retrospectivity. In the end, I could not convince a majority of the Senate in relation to that and the retrospectivity was lost. My last recollection is that the AAT decision was overturned in the Federal Court, but I suspect a challenge is before the High Court at the moment because of the amount of money at stake. I certainly support the customs department fighting that case all the way through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was roundly attacked as doing something really evil about retrospectivity in this area. Then we looked at ways to tighten up some definitions which were very much based on previous Auditor-General's reports and general comments around the place about the looseness of the administration, which is not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Customs' fault. This scheme is almost impossible to administer accurately and in a way that guarantees that the policy intent of government and parliament is carried out and that all claims, totalling I think between $1,200 million and $1,300 million, if not $1,400 million, can accurately be said to have been claimed for the legitimate purpose for which the scheme was established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I made recommendations in those areas&mdash;the debate went on, I think, for several days&mdash;I was roundly condemned that this was an attack on the mining industry, on farmers and on the productive capacity of Australia. The senators who led the charge in this place were the late Senator John Panizza, Senator  Crane, Senator McGauran, other National Party senators and Senator Ferguson. They were the most vociferous about this being an evil and terrible thing I was doing on behalf of the government to tighten up eligibility that may save the taxpayers of Australia a few million dollars and no more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to hearing Senator Crane and other Liberal Party senators and National Party senators who were so vociferous in their remarks only two years ago justify these changes to this scheme that are going to save, under one estimation I have seen, $660 million over four years, with a minimum of $110 million plus per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I read the second reading speech provided by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator Campbell), I find that all the reasons given for justifying this are the same ones I gave to save $10 million or $15 million. The Auditor-General's reports&mdash;I think there have been four or five over a decade or more&mdash;were dismissed by Senator Crane, Senator Ferguson and the late Senator John Panizza as irrelevant in this administration. Now this government comes in here and quotes pages of Auditor-General reports to justify their saving $110 million plus per annum in the diesel fuel rebate scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I had the temerity to point out in Senate estimates hearings as well as in this chamber to the taxpayers of Australia that this scheme was growing at a rate of hundreds of millions of dollars per annum and that people 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3600"> ought to understand that this is a major expenditure item for the Australian taxpayer, I was again accused by those senators opposite of trying to undermine the scheme and undermine the mining and rural industries of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators from our side have spoken most eloquently about the way in which the industry is being dudded in the negotiations as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) have driven a program to make savings from this scheme. I suggest that, if we had tried two years ago to make a minimum saving of $110 million a year from the diesel fuel rebate scheme by doing a number of the things that are being suggested in this bill, Senator Crane, Senator Ferguson and Senator Panizza would have physically taken action against us. They would have screamed the roof off in this place and gone around Australia even further than they had, saying what a dreadful government this was. Now we find dead silence, utter silence, from those senators opposite who shouted and screamed in an hysterical way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the dinner break I was pointing out the hypocrisy of a number of members of the government who, when in opposition in 1995, were making very strong, bitter and hysterical attacks, in my view, on a proposal I had as minister for customs to change some administrative matters that would have saved revenue of only a few million dollars at the most. As I pointed out before the dinner break, this was attacked as though this was a wholesale attack by the government on the viability of the mining industry and, in particular, farming in Australia. They were hysterical attacks, but they were used with considerable political effect and a number of my amendments were defeated&mdash;although a number were carried, despite the bitter opposition from some senators opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I pointed out before dinner, we now have a bill before us in which, in various estimates&mdash;whether you look in the second reading speech, the explanatory memorandum or the government's own budget documents&mdash;you could calculate there are savings to the government over the next four years of over 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $600 million, which is certainly over $150 million per annum. Another estimation is that it could be just over $100 million. Whichever way you look at it, they are significant and substantial changes to this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to the justification from senators like Senator Crane, Senator Ferguson and National Party senators who were so vociferous in their opposition when only a few changes were made. As I pointed out, the justification in the second reading speech by the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) was to quote the Auditor-General's report. When I quoted that, it was ignored at the time as not being relevant. All the arguments I used for a few  million dollars worth of savings have now been used by the government to reduce expenditure on diesel fuel rebate by some $600 million over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt, and I accept the fact, that, in any fiscal planning, when you have a program that has grown in 1983-84 from under $200 million to now $1,400 million or $1,500 million and it may reach $2 billion by the year 2000 in revenue forgone, no government is going to be able to ignore the consequences of such expenditure. I only wish the members opposite had the good grace to at least apologise for what they said in 1995, compared with what they are now putting to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition will be moving a second reading amendment at the vote on the second reading. I look forward to participating in some aspects of the committee stage of this bill when we start dealing with definitions, where, as they say, the devil is in the detail on these matters. I will look forward, in particular, to listening to Senator Crane and Senator Ferguson use the same words as they did two years ago in attacking my legislation to now defend the government, which is taking a much larger sum out of the program and is doing so in a way that clearly, by all the evidence I have seen, has even dudded the industry groups who were involved in discussions through 1996 and into early 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill really proves that, even if you are in opposition for a long time, you should try 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3601"> to maintain some consistency about how you argue fiscal and expenditure matters. If you do not, it will always come back to haunt you when you become the government. That is the main reason why I wanted to speak in this second reading debate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation before the Senate is the Hearing Services Administration Bill and the Hearing Services and AGHS Reform Bill 1997. The position of the opposition is that we are opposed to this legislation. We are opposed to this legislation for very good reasons. In particular, it is our view that what the government has in mind here&mdash;namely, to make changes to the operations of Australian Hearing Services to exclude certain clients from being able to access those services&mdash;is simply unnecessary. Secondly, the proposal to corporatise Australian Hearing Services is one which we believe is not necessary and indeed is contrary to the public interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Senator Ellison) who is at the table that the government will be moving certain amendments later which relate to the original proposal to reduce the qualifying age from 21 years to 18 years. That would have had the effect of excluding, as clients able to access 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the services available under the scheme, persons between the ages of 18 and 21 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that on review, and no doubt due to the persuasive arguments put by the opposition senators on the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, and due to the opposition from people involved in the provision of assistance to those who have impaired hearing, the government has revised their position and will no longer proceed with that proposal. That is a very welcome move by the government, we would say. It demonstrates that, as we said at the outset, this legislation was ill&hyphen;conceived, it was rushed, it was not properly thought through and it would have harsh consequences for certain groups within the community, one of those groups being students, school leavers and others between the ages of 18 and 21 years. There are still aspects of this legislation which the opposi tion believes make it contrary to the public interest and should, therefore, be opposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I indicated a moment ago that this legislation was rushed. As was pointed out in the other place by the shadow minister, Mr Lee, on 26 February, this legislation was put on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and introduced the same day&mdash;on 5 February&mdash;with the intention that it would operate from 1 March this year. That was a totally unreasonable proposition for the government to put forward and one which clearly would not have allowed sufficient time for the public, particularly those involved in the health sector and, indeed, the parliament, to give it adequate scrutiny. So from the outset the legislation had the major and fundamental flaw that it was clearly rushed legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major impacts of the legislation go to four specific areas which can be looked at as essentially two major proposals. The four key impacts of the legislation were, firstly, as I have said, to remove access for 18&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. That will apparently be addressed by an amendment to delete that proposed change from the bill. The second major area of impact, and therefore public concern, was that the legislation proposed that persons currently eligible under the scheme because they hold senior health care cards would no longer be eligible.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3602">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third major impact of the proposed legislation was the introduction of a voucher system whereby the minister, through the department, would oversee a system of clients being issued with vouchers with which they could then seek to have services provided from either Australian Hearing Services or some other private sector provider. Fourthly, the proposed legislation seeks to corporatise Australian Hearing Services leading, we would suggest, to its ultimate privatisation in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the four key areas of the proposed bills but, as I said, they fall into two broad categories: firstly, those proposed changes which remove entitlements from certain groups within the community, namely young people between 18 and 21 years of age and persons holding senior health care cards; and, secondly, the issue of corporatisation and ultimate privatisation of AHS. The legislation was appropriately referred to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee which considered the bill and handed down its report in March of this year. I would urge all honourable senators to read that report and particularly to take note of the minority or dissenting report of the opposition, and also, in certain aspects, the Australian Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report clearly acknowledges the impacts that these proposals were going to have upon client groups in the community and also upon the continued operation of Australian Hearing Services. I do not need to go through all the arguments advanced during the committee's deliberations. Other speakers who will follow me who were members of the committee when the legislation was looked at will no doubt address them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I want to say&mdash;and to reiterate&mdash;is that once practitioners, affected parties and senators had a chance to look at the impact of the legislation as it affected young people, it became clear that it was a pretty stupid proposal in the first place. The government had said that this legislation was going to improve cost&hyphen;effectiveness and efficiency. Yet it also said that the overall impact would be cost neutral.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, now that the government has recognised the error of its way in proposing to exclude 18&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;old young people, now that it has recognised that that proposal was wrong and will now withdraw it, it has acknowledged that the original cost saving for that proposal was only of the order of half a million dollars. A very small amount was going to be saved by that measure, notwithstanding the fact that many young people were likely to be affected as a result of it. While I applaud the government for having come to its senses on that proposal, I have to say that it is something that should never have been there in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue is the one that I have highlighted, namely, the proposal to corporatise Australian Hearing Services. It is noted that, overall, there are no net savings to Commonwealth expenditure from this measure or, indeed, from the legislation in total. As the opposition senators said in the minority  report, we do not oppose corporatisation for the sake of it. Indeed, when we were in government, we were on occasion criticised for some of the decisions that we made with respect to the corporatisation&mdash;or the eventual privatisation&mdash;of government instrumentalities. I understand that, and accept it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there comes a time where, rather than jumping in holus&hyphen;bolus&mdash;as this government would&mdash;on an agenda of corporatisation and/or privatisation, you have to look at the service itself and its effectiveness and determine whether or not it is doing what it is supposed to do. This government has caught the corporatisation&hyphen;privatisation disease and is&mdash;as in this legislation&mdash;proposing to divest itself of its involvement in these entities without giving any consideration to their effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to conclude on this point by referring to the committee's report&mdash;pages 13 and 14, in particular&mdash;where the Labor senators put the position most appropriately. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second aspect of this bill is the administrative changes and corporatisation of the AHS. The first step is to split the two functions of the AHS being regulator and service provider. The regulatory functions will be transferred to a new body and the service provision will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3603"> be retained by the AHS. We are not in principle opposed to this division but the benefits of corporatisation appear questionable when the additional costs of restructuring and duplication of administration are provided by the cutting of benefits to the deaf and hearing impaired.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further on the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Hearing Service points out that the cost efficiency and effectiveness of the AHS has been independently audited and verified by the Australian national Audit Office and the Centre for National Economics. "To date the cost to the taxpayer of AHS direct services has been significantly less than that of comparable private sector services."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Deafness Forum of Australia said in its submission that the AHS has been instrumental in setting and improving the quality and standards of services provided by audiometrists in Australia, and has worked to improve training in audiometry and to have better hearing technology developed and manufactured in Australia. The Deafness Forum wants to see existing services maintained, and this will not necessarily be achieved by the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of its buying power, its ability to buy in large quantities, the AHS is able to provide batteries at a 33 per cent and hearing aids at a 50 per cent discount on what people would pay privately. AHS hearing aids are provided to people at a price that is $400 lower on average than private sector providers. This represents a massive saving to most people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Centre for International Economics said that not only were the AHS' costs per new adult client lower than the fee paid for private sector services, but the AHS kept its prices well below the OECD average.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AHS' joint venture with Australian Hearing Aids Pty Ltd means the AHS is not having to import hearing aids and is creating highly skilled jobs and foreign investment, sales and exports in high quality hearing aids and devices worth $200 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Corporatisation of services is certainly beneficial where greater efficiencies can be achieved. In this instance, the Australian Hearing Services is providing an efficient, cost effective and high quality service to Australian taxpayers, the deaf and hearing impaired and the Government. It is also helping generate skilled employment and Australian export and development in hearing technology. There is no evidence that this change to the structure of AHS will increase the efficiency or quality of the service.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have not heard from the government that they challenge the fact that AHS is cost effective and that they challenge that summary of what AHS contributes, firstly, to improving the hearing ability of those people unfortunate enough to be hearing impaired but, secondly, does so in a way which is cost 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> effective for the taxpayer and for the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One has to ask why it is that the government would want to corporatise, to privatise such a service. Why would they want to introduce a system which clearly, firstly, will be disadvantageous to certain client groups, particularly those on seniors health care cards but, secondly, brings with it the clear prospect of a less efficient, less uniform, less beneficial system for those people in need of these services. The opposition does not support this legislation and it will be opposing it in due course.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The two bills that we are considering today, the Hearing Services Administration Bill 1997 and the Hearing Services and AGHS Reform Bill 1997, will bring about very significant changes to the provision of hearing services within this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills facilitate several of the measures which were outlined in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, including the introduction of a voucher system for the delivery of government funded hearing services; the introduction of managed competition between the government and the private sectors in relation to the provision of hearing services; the introduction of full commercial practices to the Australian Hearing Services; and the corporatisation of the Australian Government Health Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hearing Services and AGHS Reform Bill also removes the eligibility of seniors health cardholders for government funded hearing services and it lowers the eligibility age limit for young people from 21 to 18 years of age&mdash;although, as I understand it, the government will be moving an amendment tonight which will restore the full range of hearing services to young people between 18 and 21. The Democrats were pleased to see that the report of Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee was taken on board to some degree by the government and that it has decided to reverse its previous decision to remove the eligibility of young people in that age group. It is refreshing to see that, at least on this measure, commonsense, it appears, will prevail.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3604">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think this is an important win for young hearing impaired people because it means that the government seems to be acknowledging the many additional obstacles that these young people face during their formative and educational years. These additional obstacles mean that most young people who are hearing impaired are far more likely to complete their formal education at a later age than their non&hyphen;hearing impaired counterparts. This also means that young people who are deaf are much more likely to enter the work force and begin to earn their own income at an older age as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For these reasons, the Democrats will be happy to support the government's amendments to this section of the bill. We are, however, disappointed to see that the government does not intend to move an amendment to restore the eligibility of seniors health cardholders to government funded hearing services. Removing eligibility for seniors health cardholders flies in the face of the coalition's pre&hyphen;budget social security policy which was `to maintain all current Commonwealth concessions'. It is very difficult to understand why the government would want to break one of these election promises when the full extent of the savings to be derived from this measure, by the government's own figures is, as I understand it, zero dollars. So with the saving of zero dollars, the Democrats do not see how this little measure can be justified and we will be supporting the ALP's amendments to fully restore the eligibility of seniors health cardholders to hearing services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Democrats view the move to corporatise hearing services in Australia with some degree of caution, we are not surprised at all by the course that this government is taking. It is very much in line with stated policy goals and the policies we have seen introduced in other areas. However, we urge the government to closely monitor and to evaluate the effects of these reforms once they are put in place and to ensure that all community service obligations continue to be met by the Australian Hearing Services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats will not be opposing Part 2 of the Hearing Services and AGHS Reform Bill, which sets up transitional provisions for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the corporatisation of the Australian Government Health Service. However, I do want to make a few comments about the corporatisation of the AGHS. We have supported the corporatisation of statutory authorities when we have felt a real benefit will result from the process. While I could not say the arguments in support of the corporatisation of the AGHS are compelling, it is a fact that this organisation has been operating as a business unit&mdash;on a full cost recovery basis&mdash;within the Department of Family Services and Health for some years. As such, there seems also to be no especially compelling reason for not corporatising it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we all know that the process commenced under this bill&mdash;that of establishing a government business enterprise&mdash;is  usually the precursor to full privatisation. I think the minister should be a bit more forthright about the government's intentions in this regard because what is happening here is that an element of uncertainty is being introduced into this area. Whilst I would not be so concerned about the privatisation of some aspects of the AGHS, I would be very concerned about the loss to the public sector of some of the expertise, for instance, which has accumulated within the AGHS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are currently seeing the effects of the winding back of public health inspectors and health inspection functions around this country. The health consequences could be equally disastrous if the AGHS was privatised and the government completely gave away its capacity to conduct health and medical assessments. For example, as I understand it the AGHS currently carries out asbestos screening for former and civilian members of the armed forces and, as of fairly recently, for World War II merchant mariners. That seems to me to be an important function which could not necessarily be provided at a reasonable cost in a private sector environment to those who need it most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The flip side of that, of course, is that a corporatised AGHS may very well be able to market this particular kind of assessment as being something in which it has expertise and for which it may develop a clientele. I do not think it is any secret that the AGHS has not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3605"> always enjoyed the greatest of reputations. Many people, particularly in the disability sector, have long been critical of the AGHS's processes, medical staff and standards of service. I know that a number of people in the disability services sector are not unhappy about the AGHS being corporatised and the idea of federal and state departments having a greater choice in who, or what services, provides their health assessments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in short, while the Democrats express some reservations about where the AGHS corporatisation may end up, we will not be opposing these transitional amendments. However, I do want to make the point that the Democrats have been very unhappy with the loss of accountability which usually accompanies corporatisation. What we often end up with is a body which is still wholly owned by the taxpayers of Australia but for which the federal government is no longer accountable and for which the minister no longer accepts any responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The corporatised body often no longer has any requirement placed upon it to act in the public interest and has no or few service obligations to low income or disadvantaged clients. It often ends up being a rather secretive and shadowy agency for which, at the end of the day, nobody takes much responsibility. You can look no further than the AIDC or the ADI for examples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that the people most likely to benefit from corporatisations are senior managers who transfer from fully public bodies to the corporatised body and then on to the private body, usually presiding over reductions in services along the way and a hike in fees as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Democrats have not supported, and do not support, corporatisations where such a loss of accountability and transparency occurs. I place this government on notice that we will not support those outcomes when later legislation relating to this corporatisation comes to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of matters which have come to my attention just today. The first is the implications of this bill for health and, in particular, the use of hearing aid technicians 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the additional costs of providing such paramedical staff with adequate supervision. The second is the  impact this legislation will have on our local and very successful hearing aid manufacturing business. Neither of these issues was canvassed during the inquiry into this legislation a couple of months ago. But they have emerged. These are two matters I put on notice to the government that I will ask quite a few questions about once we move into the committee stage. </PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Hearing Services Administration Bill proposes significant changes to the way in which hearing services are delivered in the future. It will ensure that those people who need and who can afford hearing aids will be fine, but those who are on low incomes will end up on long waiting lists and others, like  students, will miss out altogether. We now know that the government has reviewed their position, but it is important to put on the record what this legislation would have meant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How many students can afford $3,000 to $5,000 to pay for two hearing aids and then pay $100 to $150 per year for batteries as well as hundreds of dollars whenever repairs are needed? I do not know too many students or young people who can afford those sorts of costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Deafness Forum of Australia has received a great deal of reaction to the prospect of 18&hyphen;, 19&hyphen; and 20-year-olds having to bear these costs themselves. The Deafness Forum has said that the community is very worried about this aspect of the legislation in particular. According to the 1996 budget, the saving on making 18&hyphen; to 21-year-olds ineligible for government hearing services is just half a million dollars. This very small saving for the government is surely not worth the angst it will cause in the community and the difficulties for dependent students who already have to overcome their hearing disability to complete their high school or tertiary studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tertiary students already have HECS fees which will have to be paid in the future because most students cannot afford to pay the fees up front. Now they will have an extra 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3606"> fee which they will not be able to defer, even though they may not be able to afford it. According to the Deafness Forum&mdash;the government should be aware of this as these figures were part of a submission to the hearing services bills inquiry by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee&mdash;there are currently around 2,500 to 3,000 clients of the government's hearing services program who are in the age group of 18 to 21. About 800 of these are provided with services in any one year. The cost of servicing these 800 clients is about $250,000 per year or less. Not everyone needs full cost services each year, and many merely need maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government is doing is putting at risk the ability of these students to complete their education&mdash;an education, if the government can create enough jobs, which will lead to jobs for these students that will make them self-sufficient members of society. We have here a group of people with disabilities who have an excellent chance of leading productive lives, and this government plans to put impediments in their way. Where is the logic in this? It seems as if no government minister thought to ask Treasury that question when this ridiculous slash was made in the budget process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Would the government prefer to see these people forced to give up their education and become reliant on the government for assistance? How many of these 18- to 21-year&hyphen;old students are still completing their secondary education because their disability has hampered the progress of their education? Because of this factor, these students deserve extra consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the first witnesses at the Senate inquiry on the  Hearing Services Administration Bill 1997  and the  Hearing Services and AGHS Reform Bill 1997  was a 22-year&hyphen;old woman who was completely reliant on her hearing aid or her lip reading abilities. Her name was Amanda Moir. With the assistance of her hearing aid, she has been able to complete her HSC, is in her third year of an associate diploma of child care and works in a centre for hearing impaired children from three to five years of age. She has done 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> extremely well and is obviously making a very positive contribution to the community in general and to those with a disability like hers. She does, however, have very serious reservations about the threat to cut assistance to 18&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds with a hearing disability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the age of four, her mother has brought Amanda and her brother up on her own. As Amanda pointed out, it would have been extremely difficult for her to afford a hearing aid and also complete her education. The very short times that her hearing aid was in for repairs were almost impossible for her. She felt isolated socially and struggled with communication and her studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thanks to the service that was in place and supported by the previous Labor government, this young woman has been able to educate  herself and has found positive employment. Most importantly, she has a very positive self-concept and had enough confidence to appear in front of a Senate inquiry. This government's alternative is to shatter the aspirations of young people like Amanda, make them reliant on government benefits and leave them with a much lower feeling of self-worth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The holders of Commonwealth seniors health cards have already lost the Commonwealth dental health program. Now they will also have to find the $3,000 to $5,000 cost for new hearing aids. To qualify for these seniors health cards, a person must have an income of less than $20,841.60. The cost of two new hearing aids would come close to a quarter of that income. Indeed, 16.4 per cent of people between 65 and 69 years of age have a hearing impairment, and 22.6 per cent of 70&hyphen; to 74&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds and 31.8 per cent of those over 75 also have hearing impairments. These figures show that there will be many people in the community affected by these changes in eligibility. This government does not have any compassion or mercy for these people. `Let the old and the young who have a low income suffer,' seems to be the message the government is strongly sending out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be obvious to everybody in the community that this government has no concept of social justice. People who are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3607"> retired have contributed to this country in many ways and have paid their taxes for many years. They are now going to have to pay the full amount for hearing aids. They are going to be punished by this government because their hearing has failed them. Effectively, this government is making them pay doubly for their disability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the government's figures, it expects to save about $1.5 million over four years through these cuts to the under 21 year olds and does not expect to save on the cuts to the Commonwealth seniors health card holders. But the figures do not add up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report of the hearing services review noted that Australian Hearing Services was able to supply hearing aids to consumers for a much lower price than private sector suppliers, mainly because it purchased enormous quantities under a long-term contract. In fact, the report stated that the AHS purchasing arrangements appeared to save the government at least $8 million per year over a five-year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AHS will lose business under the proposed voucher system. Therefore, their ability to secure lower prices will be lost and so will their $8 million savings. I do not believe that the private sector, which will not have the tax exemptions which the AHS have and will not have the monopoly of the AHS, will be able to provide the hearing aids for a lower cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So how is the government going to save the money they claim? Clearly, there are two alternatives if the government is determined to keep to their budget slashing targets. One alternative is that the voucher system will only give people vouchers which will pay for part of a hearing aid. As time goes by, the voucher will pay for a steadily declining percentage of a hearing aid. In reality, vouchers will merely give people a discount on hearing aids. Everyone will have to top up their voucher to a greater extent every year. This top up factor for the voucher system is already being openly discussed by potential recipients out in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only other obvious alternative will be to create waiting lists. If the budget for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> vouchers runs out, people will simply have to wait goodness knows how long to obtain a hearing aid. This is not just my fear. People out there in the community are also quite fearful of this prospect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This of course is a perfect way for the government to divert attention away from hospital waiting lists. The answer is to create waiting lists in other areas so Australians will become accustomed to waiting for all manner of services. The cost of such budget cuts and waiting lists will be borne by the innocent who already have to cope with a disability.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">1<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">  The consequences of people being without hearing aids for weeks, months or longer will be enormous. Many will lose the ability to communicate, others will lose self&hyphen;confidence and their quality of life and others may even lose their jobs or their place in an educational institution. This is a disgraceful and shameful  action being perpetrated by this government. It is a disgraceful and shameful action for abolishing the Commonwealth's dental health scheme, for the increased charges for home and community care, for introducing entry fees for nursing homes and forcing many elderly to sell the family home, for increasing the cost of pharmaceuticals, for not increasing the pension to take into account all of those cost increases and for denying many the assistance of acquiring hearing aids. Is this not the government who, in the run-up to the last election, assured Australians that it was working for all of us? What rubbish!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other half of this legislation is even more puzzling. The Australian Government Health Service is going to be corporatised. Why? According to the government, it is being corporatised so that it can provide mainly health assessment services for Commonwealth clients. But the AGHS is already doing this quite efficiently. The AGHS carries out medical assessments on people who apply for positions in the Commonwealth Public Service, migrant applications and others who are required to be assessed by the Commonwealth. Why does the AGHS need to be corporatised to compete with the private sector if this is the service it so adequately provides? Quite obviously, it is being prepared for privatisation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3608">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has already made it easy for companies like Woolworths to sell petrol, even if it will send many small retail petrol outlets to the wall. It is also going to make it easy for supermarket chains like Woolworths and others to sell pharmaceutical products. Surely it is not going to suggest that a company like Woolworths will be allowed to do medical assessments for the Commonwealth. Maybe that is a little far-fetched, even for this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, if this is opened up to private medical practices, the applicant who is applying for a Commonwealth job or a migration application and who is, after all, paying the doctor for the service, will be able to shop around for the most lenient doctor who will give the most glowing medical report. Most doctors, of course, would be too professional to be influenced. However, there are always those who could be easily persuaded. This is another example of a government making ill-thought&hyphen;out decisions based on political philosophy rather than commonsense. We will lose the expertise of a government body that is good at speedily assessing Commonwealth clients because this government is hell-bent on privatising large sections of the Public Service.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Hearing Services Administration Bill 1997 and the Hearing Services and AGHS Reform Bill 1997. This legislation, if it passes, would mark the start of an era of uncertainty for those who are deaf or hearing impaired. With regard to particular groups of hearing impaired, it will cause hardship that is needless and pointless.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the introduction of these bills, promises made at election time have been breached. As we have said on this side of the chamber on many occasions, those who have been singled out in the first 12 months of this government have been those in need of an element of assistance to help them get started&mdash;to get them on an equal footing. So it is with the deaf and hearing impaired. By and large, that is the position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been no better exemplification of how this government will attack those in need 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> than the measures contained in these bills. That came out clearly in the committee hearings into these bills. I was heartened to hear though that the government will make amends to the 18&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. This particular group would have been severely disadvantaged, as will other groups, but it is heartening to see that there will be amendments made to the legislation for that particular age group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the north-west coast of Tasmania, where I live, for example, there are currently approximately 50 young people who are in the age group that would have been affected by the changes. Many of these people in the 18 to 21 age group would, I suspect, either be continuing their studies or be in the unfortunate position of being unemployed. Not only have many of these young people had troubles recently&mdash;for example, with their Austudy entitlements or with the withdrawal of the  benefits they have received from the Department of Social Security&mdash;but they were not going to be able to have access to the Burnie Hearing Centre. Their access would have been&mdash;I hope it is not going to be&mdash;severely curtailed. This would have been at a period in their lives when they need to have their confidence and their self-assuredness boosted and not shattered. Again, I make the point that I am delighted that amendments will be moved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that these bills would have jeopardised the ability for young people to communicate as effectively and properly as they have in the past with a model public service provider as Australian Hearing Services is a true travesty. As I said earlier, many of the 18&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;old deaf students are still at school. Having this service removed would, as ACROD stated, `Significantly impact upon these students and their access to higher education'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The services provided by the Australian Hearing Service for the 18&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds does not just include the fitting of hearing aids, but also other assistance devices which can be very expensive. For parents of students, the financial impost in purchasing a normal hearing device so that there is adequate access to lectures and tutorials would 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3609"> have caused much unnecessary hardship. I also wonder whether, for those young people on the north-west coast and throughout Tasmania who suffer hearing loss, placing a model public service provider such as the Australian Hearing Service in a competitive environment will lead to an improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must not be forgotten that Australian Hearing Services currently provides hearing aids to its clients at an average price which is $400 lower than the private sector providers and can, for example, due to buying powers, achieve discounts of more than 33 per cent on batteries. Australian Hearing Services also, through a joint venture, produces hearing aids, creating highly skilled jobs and $200 million in foreign investment with the resultant sales and exports of high quality hearing aids and devices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, it is more likely that the Burnie Hearing Centre, which has provided so professionally services to the hearing impaired in the region, will, with the proposed reforms, see the loss of jobs and a related falling away of service. At the moment, there are private enterprises providing visiting services to the region. But I doubt whether such services will set up a regional based service equivalent to that currently provided, employing locals and spending money locally. This type of situation, I suspect, will be replicated all over regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hope that, within the next decade, one would be able to look back and observe a change for the better. I believe prima facie these bills do not augur well for the future level of service in Tasmania. I concede that competition may lead to benefits in the larger metropolitan areas, but I cannot see those benefits flowing at the same level to the deaf and hearing impaired community in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From a consumer perspective, there has not been any real problem or disadvantage with waiting times in Tasmania. I guess smallness has an advantage. Anyway, the argument is put that waiting lists reflect  a system where there is no client choice. It may also likewise be argued that they reflect the comprehensive level of ongoing after&hyphen;care services that are provided by the Australian Hearing Services. There is, on my understanding, an expectation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that a smaller number of private providers will visit the north-west coast of Tasmania and other parts of the state. But how that will provide a service other than offering devices, as opposed to a whole rehabilitation approach, is anybody's guess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania needs a public service provider like the Australian Hearing Services, as it does not possess the mass of people to drive a competitive environment. What I fear is that over the next decade we will end up with an inferior hearing service because, like many industries and professions in Tasmania, the gains to be made from adopting the Hilmer competition reforms are unknown at this stage in my home state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear a lot about the fact that those in the affected age group who will lose eligibility for full services will be able to take advantage of the extension of the hearing aid maintenance service support package for a  period of up to five years. For a young hearing impaired person, there will not be much solace gained from knowing that he or she may be eligible for maintenance when the body of a hearing aid falls on the floor and breaks or where electronic components fail. There will be no regular supply of batteries and this would impose a cost of upwards of $150 per annum. There will also be a cut&hyphen;off of the Commonwealth seniors health card holders from access to Australian Hearing Services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that there are presently 15 clients of the Australian Hearing Services on the north-west coast of Tasmania who are Commonwealth seniors health card holders. Obviously there are many more in the rest of Tasmania. There is no doubt that the number will increase with the ageing of the population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As stated in the Labor members' dissenting committee report on this measure, the government is also being mean spirited when those to be affected will largely be self-funded retirees who may be asset rich but are income poor. I thought this government was going to look after self-funded retirees but, alas, it would appear that if you have a hearing problem you will have to pay in future or go 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3610"> without. Realistically, most will not be able to afford the cost.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel that it is important to rise to speak on the Hearing Services Administration Bill. Although I no longer have the conduct of this area, I certainly feel that it is a matter of sufficient importance that some time should be spent on speaking on it this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the changes were first put forward in relation to the Commonwealth dental health services I thought I had seen some of the most callous budget cutting that I had ever seen and probably would ever see. But I have to say that, during the hearing of the Senate community affairs committee, the budget cuts disclosed in these particular pieces of legislation surpassed even the callous indifference of those cuts to the Commonwealth dental health program&mdash;and that is really saying something.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see that there has been an amendment proposed by the government in relation to the eligibility for hearing aids for those young Australians between the ages of 18 and 21. I have to say very strongly that it was not an amendment that was won with great ease, for it was a debate that went on at length within the Senate community affairs committee. In fact, the major focus of the dissenting report of both the opposition and the Democrats was the particular callousness of taking away the entitlement for that particular age group. I suppose I should be grateful that the government has seen sense and has agreed to reinstate that entitlement. But in my view it does not entirely correct the measures that are contained in these bills. I would like to spend a little time in talking about those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just before I do that, I would like to go back to the fundamental issue before us and whether this government is really, honestly putting forward its program as it promised in the election. I might remind you of something that John Howard, the Prime Minister, said in his third headland speech to the Australian Council of Social Service. He promised to `maintain all current Commonwealth concessions'. In my view, to take away the entitlement to hearing aids of those senior health cardholders is in complete contradiction 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to and shows complete disregard for this promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that we have had a lot of debate about core promises and non&hyphen;core promises, but I think it is very difficult to say that this particular promise of maintaining current Commonwealth concessions would have been seen by the vast majority of Australians&mdash;and, in particular, the vast majority of Australians who had the benefit of those Commonwealth concessions&mdash;as anything but a core promise. I think there are many members of the community who would see it as a betrayal; that now that this government has control of policy and control of our budget it sneaks around behind people's backs and takes away an entitlement that people rely on to maintain a reasonable lifestyle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Returning just quickly to the 18&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, one of the matters that I think is worth focusing on, in particular, is to look at the budget impact of the change proposed by the  government and to examine the amount of money that was at stake in relation to 18&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. I really think it is quite shocking. In order to save the huge sum of $500,000, this government were prepared to throw away the lives of those deaf and hearing impaired young people between the ages of 18 and 21. I think that is really quite horrifying. If you were looking at maybe a much larger sum I suppose you could understand why the government might be tempted, but when you are looking at what I might describe as piddling sums for which they are prepared to wreak damage on people, whose lives are extraordinarily difficult already, for that sort of money it really makes me feel ill. That is the truth of it and I think the people who gave evidence to us in the Senate Community Affairs Committee felt pretty much the same way. I am certain that even though you have reversed your decision, the betrayal that was contained in this bill will not be easily forgotten.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have remedied the situation. The government have seen fit to withdraw from their proposition for the affected young people in Australia but they have not felt that they should extend this generosity to those 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3611"> people who are at the senior end of the spectrum, those people who have a seniors health card and who are entitled to the benefit of a hearing aid. They have not reinstated this one. They have shown a little bit of humanity towards the young people but they have not seen fit to show that same humanity to the older people in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of older people in the community do have a difficult time. They have, in large part, provided substantial amounts of taxation money to the community during their working lives. Now they have retired with maybe a little bit of money set aside and they have been told that a benefit that they have relied on for some time&mdash;that is, a hearing aid&mdash;will no longer be available to them because of a decision of this government. The trouble with elderly people is that many of them when they first left the work force may not have had difficulties with their hearing but, as we all know, as time marches on, more and more people are affected by lack of hearing or their hearing becomes impaired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is this particular group of people that this budget change so seriously affects because they will not be provided with assistance in the future. It is not a very small group of people, either. In fact, the total number of people that have been assisted by the Australian Hearing Services is 180,000. What proportion of that are seniors cardholders? It is almost impossible to estimate. The department made some attempt to but, in giving evidence to the committee, they admitted quite freely that it was not possible to exactly say. We do know that for a lot of people it will have an effect on their lifestyle and it will mean that they will not enjoy the sort of life that they expected when they retired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing about the 33,000 Commonwealth seniors health cardholders who are not obtaining this benefit is that this cut, according to the budget documentation, shows no savings whatsoever. That is a fairly remarkable statement that this government, in the case of seniors, are prepared to go even further than they did for young people. For young people they were prepared, for the princely sum of $500,000, to take away the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quality of their lives. For the 33,000 Commonwealth seniors cardholders, they are prepared to do that for nil savings. That is really quite an astonishing proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, this government should be rethinking their entire approach in relation to this bill. They should be stepping back from this callous approach. They should be stepping back from this niggardly penny&hyphen;pinching which, in the end, will affect only those who are the most vulnerable in our society and the most likely to be adversely affected. The government should start to have a little bit more of a generous heart and a little bit more regard for the promises they made when they wanted to get into power and should not so quickly disregard the people who are relying on them.</PARA></SPEECH>

Senator Neal fails to mention that, in this recent budget, the government announced extra funding of $2 million for cochlear implants for profoundly deaf children. That was not something we went to the election with; that was something we saw a need for in the community. There are just under 400 young Australians who could lead a normal life with such an implant and funding was provided for that. Senator Neal also does not mention the mess that we found the finances of this country in when we took power or that we had to take steps to make sure that the deficit, which had blown out to $10 billion, was addressed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3612">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me deal specifically with the matters that were raised by the opposition. Senator Forshaw made the statement that the government was not supporting AHS as being cost effective. The government believes that AHS has done a good job in improving standards throughout the hearing services industry. But that does not mean that things should just stay forever there. There are better ways and the government is pursuing this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will retain the same level of monitoring in standards as in the present system. It will remove the conflict of interest between the AHS providing a regulatory service whilst also being a service provider itself. What the government proposes is that there will be an office of hearing services, which will oversee the voucher system. The AHS will be free to compete with the private sector on an equal footing in relation to the provision of health services. This competition will improve the system and will allow consumers that all important free choice between service providers. That can only mean a benefit for the people of Australia. There will be no diminution at all in the provision of hearing services. There will not be the harsh consequences for those people under 21 that were mentioned because, as I said, the government will be moving that amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the opposition who can say that they thought this amendment was important because I notice that the Democrats alluded to that very amendment themselves, as did the chair of the committee, Senator Knowles, from the government. It was recognised universally by the members of the committee, by people who gave evidence and also as a result of consultation carried out by the government that the amendment was necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge the frankness with which Senator Forshaw admitted that the previous government was no stranger to corporatisation or privatisation in any way. I refer to the federal airports, Australian Defence Industries, the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas and Telstra. There was a definite corporatisation spirit in the opposition when it was in government. Therefore, I fail to see how it can say that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> corporatisation here is such an evil thing, especially when it will provide consumers with a choice. That entirely destroys the argument of the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two bills that we have before us deal not only with the Australian Hearing Service but also with the Australian Government Health Service. Senator Allison mentioned that the AGHS had been given the job of screening for asbestosis in marine seamen who were involved in the last war. The AGHS won that on a full cost recovery, competitive basis and there is no reason at all to assume that, under the new system, the AGHS will not be able to fulfil that function in the future. It will, of course, continue with that screening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures are innovative. They will provide competition in both the health and hearing services. They will give the people of Australia a choice of provider. The AHS will retain its charter to service children, those people who fall into special categories and, in particular, those people living in rural and  remote areas such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. So there will be a safety net there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the other aspects which are more detailed can be dealt with during the committee stage. I would commend this bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of audiologists and audiology organisations have raised some questions with me. One relates to hearing aid technicians who are known as audiometrists. The effect of the Hearing Services and AGHS Reform Bill is, as I understand it, to increase the number of opportunities for audiometrists to practise and that the Office of Hearing Services would supervise the work by medical practitioners in private industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concern which was raised with me was that more of these hearing aid technicians would be operating. A correspondent who says that a number of errors can be made in the licensing of audiologists has given me a case history showing the implications of this. It concerns a woman&mdash;I will read it out to the Senate because it is interesting&mdash;who:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . attended a non-audiologist tester in a rural community, who performed a hearing assessment without the use of a soundproof facility. The tester reported the presence of a unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and subsequently recommended the fitting of a hearing aid in her right ear. The tester did not suggest nor indicate the necessity of medical and audiological follow up at the time of the assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some months later, the woman consulted an audiologist and attended the Audiology department of a metropolitan hospital. The results of the audiologist's assessment showed a unilateral sensorineural hearing loss. On the basis of the results, a subsequent urgent otological follow up was initiated. The woman was found to have an acoustic neuroma on her right auditory nerve. This was removed in a neurosurgical procedure in a major metropolitan neurosurgery unit. However, due to the size of the tumour on the acoustic nerve, the patient had a resultant complete loss of hearing on the right side, and slight facial weakness on the right side.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She subsequently contacted the original non-audiologist tester, seeking a refund for her hearing aid which was now useless to her. The tester refused to make a refund for the hearing aid fitted to the right ear. The tester also refused to provide details of their assessment, despite the signed request of the patient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The person who wrote to me on this subject says that there is a real health danger here to people being tested by such non-professionals, or at least hardly trained technicians, and that this is likely to be exacerbated by the passing of this bill. I gather that this correspondence has also been sent to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) for his opinion.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just wondered whether perhaps Senator Ellison could give us the government's response to this, because I am actually quite concerned about this matter. If it is a matter for this bill, and perhaps an amendment which ought to have been put forward, then perhaps we need some time to think about what that amendment should be and whether it should be put tonight or whether there should be a suspension of consideration of this bill until there is a time to consider it more thoroughly.</PARA></SPEECH>

In fact audiometrists do work in the private sector and organisations which are contracted by the AHS. I am not aware of the particular case  you mentioned. Certainly I can undertake to pursue that. But that case would indicate more a problem with the current system rather than the one proposed by the passing of this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has to be remembered that, with the passing of this bill, there will be an Office of Hearing Services, which will carry out the regulatory role and will not have the conflict of interest the AHS currently has. The AHS currently is both a provider and a regulator at the same time. That would not happen in the situation were this bill to be passed, because you will have the OHS overseeing this.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In taking evidence on the Australian Hearing Services, we received evidence that about 180,000 people are serviced by them. Of these, about 75 per cent are fitted with hearing aids. From my rough calculations, that is about 135,000 people. One of the major advantages of the Australian Hearing Services is that they are able to provide these hearing services extraordinarily cheaply. I suppose we see the positive side of having a government monopoly in that sense. It appears that the cost of a hearing unit is, in some cases, $400 a unit less than comparable private providers. How can we be assured or will you assure us that in fact those people who are eligible for a concessional hearing

My concern is, if Australian Hearing Services is no longer providing 135,000 hearing aids, they will not be able to buy them as cheaply.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to refer to the inquiry and to the comments that were made on  this subject by Mr Cochran  from the Department of Health and Family Services. There was quite a lot of discussion about how this tendering process would work. As I under 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3617"> stand it, Mr Cochran was asked about the tendering process and what that would mean in terms of achieving a level playing field. I asked the question, `Was it the aim to bring the tenders down to the same level as the Australian Hearing Services pays for their services?' As Senator Neal rightly points out, they have the advantage of economies of scale and their unit price is much lower than the private sector can manage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The answer that Mr Cockran gave was that there will be extra cost involved for AHS in putting it on that level playing field in that they will pay a dividend to the government that reflects the cost of taxes, and so forth, that would be incurred in the private sector. In other words, when the tenders are completed&mdash;that is a government based tender process, as I understand it, to which the private sector tenderers can access hearing aids at a unit price&mdash;if that unit price is higher than that which is achievable by the government, then the government services, AHS, is required to refund the government by the difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we are doing here is creating a level playing field but not without some cost both in terms of the hearing aid units and, presumably, in terms of the cost to taxpayers.

As a result of the last budget, more job losses are expected in the ACT. These will not be just public sector job losses. There will be flow&hyphen;on job losses in the private sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another city in Australia that has been subjected to a decision resulting in about 2,000 job losses. That decision was made not by a government but by a large private corporation. It decided, basically, to wind up a significant proportion of its operations. This event has captured the heart of the nation. There is a sense of abhorrence that a company can shut up shop, move out and leave a community devastated. As a result of this, there has been a political response&mdash;and quite rightly too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The political response to commit $10 million in an assistance package to the people of Newcastle is well founded. It probably will not be enough to secure their futures, but it will go a long way in assisting the community 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the struggles that they face. The total package now for Newcastle is $12.25 million, thanks to an extra $2.25 million for employment programs in the Hunter region. Senator Vanstone concluded that 2,000 job losses in Newcastle required $2.25 million for employment programs. My point this evening is that, with respect to Canberra, we are anticipating 7,000 job losses and, if you apply Senator Vanstone's own calculations, that would mean that we could have at least $5 million here for employment programs to help us through the difficult employment transition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The similarities between Newcastle and Canberra are there. They are both Labor areas; they are both one&hyphen;industry towns. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately&mdash;it depends on your perspective&mdash;Canberra's one industry or dominant industry is the Public Service. It does not attract quite the response in the Australian community that the blue&hyphen;collar steel industry does. That is not only a shame for the people of Canberra but also a reflection on the job that this government has done on the role that the public sector plays in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that, under the Howard Liberal government, we have seen continued attacks against the public sector&mdash;and not just in a dry drive for economic efficiencies and cost cutting and savings; we have seen an attack on a philosophical basis. We have seen a move to a market economy where the private sector takes over the service provision role formerly held by government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bitter pill to swallow that we cannot blame a big private company that is motivated by profit maximisation. We are actually being abandoned by the government itself, the government that we all pay our taxes to. They are the ones pulling out of town; they are the ones cutting the jobs. And there is no hint of a package to help the Canberra economy through this transition. In fact, there was not even an offer to the government of the ACT to waive some of the contribution to the deficit reduction program in an effort to offset the damage that is being done through the cuts to the public sector.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3619">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the cuts to the public sector affect many regional communities in Australia, and Canberra is not the only one, but I draw these comparisons on the basis of the magnitude and the concentration of the cuts here. I am of the view that this needs to be seen in the same context as any other regional community. I congratulate the respective governments for acknowledging the situation in Newcastle and for taking some remedial action to limit the damage, but I ask that the same courtesies, the same acknowledgment be applied to Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the groups that is particularly affected by this is the private sector; it is not just the public sector. The people of Canberra are sick of hearing the simplistic mantra by both the federal Liberal government and the ACT Liberal government that states there is a transition of jobs from the public to the private sector as a result of the changes that they are implementing. That is not the case. It has been shown that the private sector suffers inordinately whenever there is a cut in public sector jobs and that outsourcing or a transfer of those jobs from the public to the private sector is not the solution it has been painted as being by the Liberal governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ms Wendy Hamilton, the Chairwoman of the Canberra Business Council outsourcing task force, in an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, is reported as saying:</PARA>

The article reports Ms Hamilton as saying that it was a `matter of concern' to see federal government departments now contemplating `piggybacking' on some of the few contracts that have actually been let out.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Privacy protection needs to extend to the collection, storage, security, access, correction, use, destruction and disclosure of all personal information. I believe that the present legislative scheme that is outlined in the Privacy Act 1988 addresses the collection, storage, use and disclosure of personal information held by the government. This scheme also extends to credit reporting and some telecommunications suppliers and operators. This scheme does not, however, extend to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A discussion paper was released by the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) on 12 September last year which set out a scheme based on the existing information privacy principles in the Privacy Act 1988 and added to this codes of practice and a range of additional provisions which addressed the particular concerns of the private sector. In essence, this was a proposal for industry codes of practice supervised by the Privacy Commissioner and subject to statutory backing&mdash;a co&hyphen;regulatory approach. This scheme is consistent with the schemes adopted by New Zealand, Hong Kong and, of course, the European Union.</PARA>

The cost of compliance may also be offset against the improved management of personal information. What the Prime Minister must consider is that, in these changing times, personal information now has a value the extent of which I do not believe it has ever had before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> a story entitled `Banks tapping into heavy number&hyphen;crunching' states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the retail trade . . . computers have matched things like age, sex and credit card spending habits and discovered that on Friday nights, an extraordinary number of 30-year-old men develop an apparently compelling desire for two oddly juxtaposed items. They stop into the supermarket on the way home from work and pick up nappies and beer. That's led to rapid rearrangement of shelves.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This story shows the way in which personal information in the form of age, sex and credit card spending habits have been applied for commercial purposes. This is personal information, and this personal information has some commercial value. Consumers should be able to know that their personal information is in fact adequately protected. I do not think this is an unreasonable trade-off for compliance costs, and I do not think it should be overlooked by government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3621">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The European Union privacy directive, which comes into force on 1 July 1998, will prevent trade with Australia&mdash;and any other country, for that matter&mdash;if there are not adequate privacy laws to protect personal information. The absence of privacy laws is unlikely to satisfy this trade requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week the Attorney-General actually suggested that the European Union did not require identical protection or equivalent protection. That is true. As I have said, no protection at all is unlikely to be an adequate level of  protection. This issue is further highlighted by legislation like the Trans&hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill 1996, presently before the Senate. This legislation includes specific provisions about privacy. If the Attorney-General's conclusions are correct, why are these sorts of provisions neces sary in legislation? Surely commercial incentive, as he suggests, would be sufficient. But clearly this is not correct, and the government must address this important issue of trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Commonwealth does not introduce such laws, New South Wales has indicated that it will introduce a scheme. Victoria, Tasmania, Queensland, the ACT, South Australia and the Northern Territory are also presently examining privacy legislation options. If state and territory governments do introduce privacy schemes, businesses will be required to comply with those requirements, which may end up being different for each state and territory, therefore increasing overall compliance costs significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the reassurances of the Prime Minister and the Attorney&hyphen;General are hollow in light of the state and territory responses and highlight the need for a national and consistent privacy scheme. This issue also suggests that the compliance costs argument may not have been fully considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a fundamental principle that a person has a right to know what personal information is held about them and, if the information is lawfully held, that the information is correct. Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that no-one shall be subject to arbitrary and unlawful interference with his or her 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> privacy. Privacy is a human rights issue, and the government should deal with this issue appropriately by introducing suitable legislative schemes to comply with Australia's international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week, the Attorney-General said that businesses had a commercial incentive to protect privacy. In fact, in response to a question from me in this place, Minister Vanstone said the week before that some businesses have already taken steps to introduce good privacy practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Self-regulation has many beneficial aspects, but it should not be relied upon as the only means of regulation. Certainly, the Australian Democrats support a strong and enforceable privacy scheme which helps to assure consumers that their personal information is being adequately protected. Self-regulation falls down because it does not have the supporting mechanisms for investigation and enforcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be noted that developing a scheme to address the diverse requirements of protecting privacy is complex and will require extensive consultation and consideration. I have set out a few of these matters here and place on the record my particular concern, as well as that of my party, that a range of other matters need to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's backflip from its election commitment&mdash;because it did make a promise that it would extend privacy laws to the private sector&mdash;is an unfortunate decision. I would encourage the government to take steps to reconsider its decision and consult a little more widely so that it does not rely on the interests of a few to the exclusion of an international best practice privacy scheme and the potential to develop and lead the information businesses of the future.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="3621"><TITLE>Kurwongbah  By&hyphen;Election

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7L6">Senator HOGG</NAME><STATE> (Queensland)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.09 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to talk on the issue of the by-election which occurred in the state seat of Kurwongbah on Saturday last. The by-election was necessitated by the resignation of Margaret Woodgate. Margaret was a former 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3622"> minister in the Labor government and had served the electorate extremely well over a long period of time but had to resign due to ill health. Then followed a preselection process within the Labor Party whereby we, through the rank and file, selected the candidate, Linda Lavarch.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MACDONALD" NAMEID="YW4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator Ian Macdonald</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Was anyone charged over that like they were in Townsville?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7L6">Senator HOGG</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, those sorts of things do not happen. Anyway, you are getting off the point of my rising this evening. Linda was selected on her own merits. Linda was a person who had a long experience in the community. She had lived there for the last 20 years. Linda had been heavily involved in community groups. Linda acted as a volunteer solicitor at the Petrie Community Legal Centre. Linda's children went to local schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Linda herself has achieved admission as a solicitor and is also currently completing a Bachelor of Social Science degree majoring in psychology. Linda was also the President of the Australian Community Safety and Research Organisation, a group which formulates community responses for crime prevention. So in her own right, she was well and truly credentialled to stand as the candidate for the seat of Kurwongbah and, moreover, to be elected successfully last Saturday as the new representative for that state seat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unfortunate aspect of Linda's election to the state parliament is that the media have portrayed her as being the wife of the former Attorney-General. This, through no fault of Linda or her husband, has been designed to take away from the personal ability, capability and integrity of Linda herself. It has also been designed to sell more newspapers and to provide a bit of a beef up as far as the media are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I rise to acknowledge the credentials of Linda Lavarch in her own right as the successful candidate who achieved a five per cent swing in that by-election and the successful candidate who did not campaign as the wife of the former A&hyphen;G but who has been portrayed by certain sections of the media in that way. I think that has done a great disservice 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to those people who reported in that particular way on such a fine person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Undoubtedly though, there are other lessons in that particular by-election which people should take note of. Whilst I will not go into these in any depth this evening, I will just make a passing reference to one of the headlines in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> which warned `Blitz signals poll warning'. That refers to the advances that were made by an Independent candidate who, to all intents and purposes, looked like a candidate from the One Nation Party but was not endorsed by that party. What we saw emerging in this particular by-election was the Hanson effect for probably the first major time in any poll.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This of itself is concerning, particularly when one considers that the coalition received one out of four first preference votes and the Labor Party received one out of two. So there is undoubtedly a lesson there for the coalition&mdash;they failed to quell the march of Ms Hanson early in the piece and she is going to be a force to be reckoned with in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the coalition in Queensland took no notice of the result on Saturday, and I think they did so at their own peril. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of today in Melbourne carried a headline `Borbidge unfazed by swing in poll'. However, no-one can shy away from the fact that there was at least a five per cent primary vote  swing to the Labor Party and something in the order of an eight per cent swing two&hyphen;party preferred. This was achieved by an excellent candidate who ran an excellent campaign and did so on her own merits, not on the merits of her husband.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the significant thing about Linda Lavarch. She is her own person&mdash;a capable person&mdash;and will prove to be a very competent member for the state seat of Kurwongbah in Queensland. I suppose it is worthwhile pointing out that she has a very good husband, whose name is Michael. I think I should leave the state seat of Kurwongbah there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I would like to briefly mention, seeing that it is sporting night tonight, is that the Brisbane Strikers won the national soccer league before a record crowd in Brisbane yesterday over Sydney United. To 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3623"> them I extend my congratulations. It was interesting&mdash;Senator Woodley might note this&mdash;that the southern media wanted to downplay the fine achievement by the Brisbane Strikers over the weekend.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak tonight on a matter which has dogged my state and been before this Senate for some years. It concerns the shredding of the Heiner inquiry documents ordered by the Goss government to stop their use in litigation after the Crown had been put on notice of impending court proceedings in which those records were critically relevant and also after the Crown knew that the documents were being sought by a legally enforceable access statute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter first came under scrutiny in 1995 by the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing, chaired by Senator Shayne Murphy and of which I was also a member. There now appears to be further evidence referred to the Senate by the Queensland parliamentary Criminal Justice Committee alleging that the CJC misled our deliberations in 1995. I understand that the CJC's handling of what is also known as `the Lindeberg allegations' is to come under scrutiny in Queensland again by the Connolly&hyphen;Ryan judicial review into the effectiveness of the CJC in the near future. Another announcement which is long awaited and rather overdue is an announcement by the Borbidge government concerning the establishment of a separate commission of inquiry to investigate this very serious affair in accordance with the recommendation of the Morris&hyphen;Howard report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My reason for speaking tonight is to inform the Senate of another important development which is of relevance to the federal parliament because of the international attention that the shredding is now attracting. I wish to inform the Senate that the shredding has now come to the attention of the International Council 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on Archives in Paris. It may be debated at an inaugural meeting of a subcommittee on electronic and other current records to be held at The Hague in the Netherlands on 18 to 20 June 1997. However, that is yet to be resolved within the ICA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The International Council on Archives is a non-governmental organisation, acting internationally, which is concerned with archives and their role in the conduct of public and private activities, the protection of individual rights and the advancement of human knowledge and culture. Founded in 1948 at a meeting convened by UNESCO, the ICA was formally established at its first international congress held in Paris two years later in 1950. Its headquarters are in Paris. The ICA is a non-governmental organisation admitted in the category of consultative and associate relations with UNESCO, category A. It cooperates with other international organisations in implementing projects of common interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The management of our public records in Australia is a measure of the how open and accountable our governments are. It is a measure of our commitment to democratic principles and the rule of law and it is a yardstick by which we can be judged internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the course of our select committee deliberations, the role of the state and federal archivists, as represented by the CJC, was put  on the public record. It was a position which Mr Lindeberg, the man at the centre of the affair, objected to quite vigorously at the time. The CJC's 1995 declaration has been subsequently roundly condemned by former chief Victorian archivist and former Australian ICA representative Mr Chris Hurley. He did a detailed analysis in March 1996. He now works at the national archives in New Zealand. Regrettably, our Senate select committee did not have the benefit of his expertise in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue at stake is essentially a simple one, but one of great importance. If the Crown or the state, through its statutory keeper of public records, cannot be relied on to impartially and independently protect public records from destruction when those 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3624"> records are known to be required for foreshadowed court proceedings or when it is known that they are the subject of a legally enforceable access statute, the due administration of justice is gravely imperilled. That is essentially what the Lindeberg declaration states in a document I wish to table later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a Democrat, I find it hard to think of anything more serious than the Crown or state deliberately shredding public records to thwart justice. One of Australia's leading Queen's Counsel, Mr Ian Callinan, described it as an unthinkable act. It is made much worse, however, when executive government uses and abuses the independent and impartial good office of a state or federal archivist to achieve that objective. Archivists should be protecting records in the public interest, not destroying them for any desired outcome of executive government or its agencies at the expense of individual lawful rights. It is fundamentally undemocratic and may breach criminal and administrative law in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Archivists must be able to lawfully withstand pressure from any executive government and its agencies when incidents like this occur in the future. Former Queensland Police Commissioner Noel Newnham, now a lecturer at Charles Sturt University in Sydney, described this case as `monumentally serious'. He courageously, and quite properly, I believe, criticised the CJC's handling of the Lindeberg complaint and the cavalier manner in which that body treated him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude by saying this: it is totally unacceptable for any Australian government to send to the international community a signal that shredding public records to stop their use in court proceedings or to stop lawful access to them is acceptable conduct in our public and legal administration or in any aspect of public life at all. It brings our reputation as a nation governed by the rule of law into unacceptable disrepute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Queensland archivist, or any archivist, cannot operate above our courts and cannot be oblivious to the rights of individuals. While it is accepted that the Queensland archivist may have been misled by the Goss cabinet 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and others about the true legal status of the material she approved to be shredded, she certainly became aware shortly after the shredding, and did little to protect the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a serious matter. The current Queensland government appears incapable of properly resolving this matter. It is no wonder that the ICA is taking an interest in this case. I seek leave to table the Lindeberg declaration submission, dated 7 May 1997, so that honourable senators interested in this matter may read in greater detail why it has captured the attention of archivists throughout the world. I have given copies to the whips and there may be some problem. The government said they were happy with that.</PARA>

<ENTRY COLNAME="C2" MOREROWS="0" ROTATE="0" VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT">This project explored the need to increase the efficiencies of steam raising in order to conserve fuel and help reduce greenhouse gasses. The executive summary describes the use of radiant tubes or candles as a way of burning natural gas with increased radiant efficiency. The project demonstrated that up to 49 per cent of radiant efficiencies could be achieved in sub-surface burners. Further work on the reliability of the burners now needs to be undertaken to offer boiler manufacturers an Australian gas fired alternative to present systems.</ENTRY>

<ENTRY COLNAME="C2" MOREROWS="0" ROTATE="0" VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT">Much of tropical Australia is not only environmentally sensitive to oil spills but vast and remote. The use of mechanical or physical clean up techniques in mangrove and saltmarsh habitats can cause extensive damage to these foreshores and is extremely difficult and expensive to undertake.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">Bioremediation, or the accelerated and improved efficiency of the natural degradation of oil by micro-organisms, has the potential to reduce the environmental impact of marine oil spills on tropical Australian foreshores.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">The primary objective of this project is to assess the feasibility of bioremediation to clean up oil spills in environmentally sensitive tropical foreshore environments so that the findings can be incorporated into the overall planning and response management plan for oil spills in Australia.</ENTRY>

As a renewable form of electricity,the recommended demonstration plant would consume no fossil fuels, be pollution-free and would provide a reliable, long term energy source for a remote area of Australia. According to the study, a relatively small tidal power plant could enable an estimated reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by between 45,000 and 70,000 tonnes each year of operation.</ENTRY>

<ENTRY COLNAME="C2" MOREROWS="0" ROTATE="0" VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT">Depending on location, up to 10% of electricity may be lost in transmission and distribution networks and devices in Australia each year. This loss is due to the resistance in conventional metallic conductors.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">So called "superconductors" have zero resistance to electric current under certain operation conditions. Therefore the economical exploitation of these materials to deliver electricity is attractive to energy suppliers and users.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">High temperature superconductors are a class of ceramic materials that operate at temperatures up to 120 degrees Kelvin (minus 150 degrees Celsius). At these temperatures&mdash;which are high compared with those at which metallic superconductors can operate&mdash;the economics for exploiting the superconducting properties of these materials in power applications become attractive.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">This project is aiming to build a small scale manufacturing facility that could supply a range of Australian&mdash;developed, high temperature superconducting wire. The wire is considered to be one of the key elements in future electricity distribution cables and equipment and has great potential for other applications.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">The ability to produce the wire in lengths of up to 1km, and of consistent quality, will be regarded as a significant milestone in the commercialisation of this technology.</ENTRY>

<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">ABARE found that in the short term (5-10 years) the projects focussing on energy use are potentially the big energy savers in greenhouse gas emissions. Over the same time span, the supply side options (electricity generation and distribution) show the largest relative rises in potential carbon dioxide reductions.</ENTRY>

<ENTRY COLNAME="C2" MOREROWS="0" ROTATE="0" VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT">The overall objective is to increase the rate of discovery of oil through analysis of oil bearing fluid inclusions from unsuccessful wells to determine whether the borehole is on a migration pathway. These pathways will be mapped from source to accumulation to determine if more than one oil charge has migrated through targeted horizons. If successful, the technique will be made available to the oil industry which could result in reduced costs and damage to the environment from a decrease of the number of holes drilled during the exploration process.</ENTRY>

<ENTRY COLNAME="C2" MOREROWS="0" ROTATE="0" VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT">Orbital's existing direct injection, two-stroke technology is being developed for four-stroke automotive applications to better meet the requirements of the passenger vehicle market.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">The focus of the project is to reduce fuel consumption of the urban test vehicle by 10 per cent whilst also achieving a reduction in nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. Exhaust emissions performance will then be further refined to meet the forthcoming low emission vehicle target levels mandated in the United States and Europe.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">Successful adoption of this technology by the motor industry would result in significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from passenger vehicles. There would also be benefits through improved driveability, reduced local exhaust emissions and therefore less smog, and reduced energy requirements in the urban transport fleet, resulting in fuel cost savings for vehicle owners.</ENTRY>

<ENTRY COLNAME="C2" MOREROWS="0" ROTATE="0" VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT">A site in Melbourne is demonstrating a battery load levelling system. Load levelling is the management of the peaks and troughs in electricity demand and is facilitated by storing electricity in batteries.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">The cost of conventional batteries prevents their use in most load levelling situations. Zinc bromine batteries have been chosen for this demonstration project because they are innovative and promise to be much cheaper than existing batteries. Therefore, the overall economics of the battery load levelling systems could become more attractive.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">By demonstrating a real battery system integrated into the electricity supply network, the project will showcase the potential of this Australian owned technology. Expected benefits include increased efficiency in electricity supply, and subsequent potential reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.</ENTRY>

<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">It involves developing a low cost reflector surface for use as a concentrator which can boost the winter performance of flat plate solar water heaters. The reflector technology will have the potential to increase the projected area of the solar collector in winter, without increasing collection rates in summer.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">To complement the reflector technology, an advanced, two-faced, flat plate solar collector will also be investigated. Improving collector performance by incorporation devices that reduce internal air flow and reflection could reduce the negative impacts of high operating temperatures. This in turn could allow increased storage temperatures, and smaller, more heavily insulated tanks could be used to store a similar amount of energy than that available in current systems.</ENTRY>

<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">In this project, Waverley Council in Sydney, NSW, is to commission two spark ignited, compressed natural gas (CNG) powered trucks&mdash;a garbage compactor and a tipper. A 12-month operational trial of the vehicles will be conducted. The demonstration of the technology is designed to facilitate the adoption of the vehicles in Australia.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">CNG-powered trucks have quieter engines and cleaner emissions, providing a more attractive option for vehicles in localised environments.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">An extensive economic and environmental assessment will be undertaken to investigate both the short term, and medium to long term benefits and the implications of the adoption of the technology. This will include an analysis of the short haul private market, together with the potential for government initiatives to encourage the use of the technology.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">The project is also funded by the New South Wales Department of Energy, and is supported by the South Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils (SSROC). SSROC membership covers a substantial portion of southern Sydney and its support offers significant potential for the immediate adoption of the technology, should the outcome of the pilot project prove to be favourable.</ENTRY>

<ENTRY COLNAME="C2" MOREROWS="0" ROTATE="0" VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT">New methods for measuring the flow of natural gas and its behaviour at different pressures, temperatures and compositions, will be developed in this project. This information is important for improving pipeline efficiencies in the Australian gas industry and will aid its competitiveness nationally and in overseas markets. Once the measurements have been gathered, they will assist in establishing parameters for determining gas measurement and characteristics over a wide range of conditions. The information will also be validated with leading European gas research organisations to ensure that international measurement procedures are optimised for Australian conditions.</ENTRY>

<ENTRY COLNAME="C2" MOREROWS="0" ROTATE="0" VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT">This project is part of a larger project to develop an economically viable way of producing fuels from biomass and the wastes that result from biomass growth, processing or disposal.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">In this case, lignocellulose (the content of woody cells) which can be obtained from crop and forest wastes, is used to produce two fuels, ethanol and lignin. Ethanol is an alternative fuel for transport, and lignin, a co-product of the production process, is a renewable fuel for generating steam and electricity.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">The ethanol is made by fermenting sugars obtained from lignocellulose. However, the best way to derive the sugars requires a lot of acid, which currently makes the process uneconomic. This project aims to design, construct and test equipment that can economically separate and recycle the acid.</ENTRY>

However further work is required to reduce these emissions&mdash;especially the production of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, whose levels depend on the particular engine, its speed, the fuel injection system and the load.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">Preliminary research has shown that adding ignition improver can lower the levels of emissions produced and also allows an increase in the amount of ethanol in the fuel mix.

Wind power is an important renewable energy source for generating electricity. However, in comparison to Europe and US there is little operational experience in Australia, apart from Western Power's use of wind power to feed into diesel grids. Australia's invovlement will provide regular opportunities for its experts on wind power manufacturing and research to share experiences with their international counterparts.</ENTRY>

<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">The heating component will be powered by natural gas; the cooling system will be water assisted; and both the cooling and ventilation systems will operate without a compressor and the total system is aided by an efficient, counterflow heat exchanger. This mix will provide an estimated 80% reduction in normal running costs on cooling and up to 50% on heating.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">Potential benefits include: reduction in chemical irritants present in modern buildings, due to the complete and frequent fresh air changes moving through the system; and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, achieved by diversifying the energy supply option.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">If successful, the project will be developing a unique product on the international market, made completely from Australian content and technology.</ENTRY>

<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">This project is developing switchable glazing systems, which allow the control of light and heat through building windows and skylights by changing the colour of the window, and therefore changing the amount of energy transmitted through the window.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">The control will be electronic and can integrate simply with a building energy management system to optimise the energy saving potential of the windows.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">The project is also addressing the potential life of the glazing systems by testing various control methods and the reliability of the materials used, under extended operation.</ENTRY>

<ENTRY COLNAME="C2" MOREROWS="0" ROTATE="0" VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT">Buildings are significant consumers of energy, mainly as electricity for lighting, power, heating and cooling purposes, etc. But there are also energy-related impacts which buildings have on their environments. Researchers at RMIT University and elsewhere are investigating the energy impacts of manufacturing, transporting, assembling, demolishing and recycling building materials; and the emission of harmful gases into the atmosphere released by these processes. ERDC, which manages the federal government's direct investment in energy innovation, plays a leading role in sponsoring such research in Australia.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">If these environmental impacts are to be minimised, then designers, constructors, building occupiers, and the energy industries themselves, must be informed about the research. This project will establish effective methods for gathering and disseminating information about research projects and activities dealing with the energy-related environmental impacts of buildings. this will be done nationally for Australia and, through the International Energy Agency, on a world-wide basis. The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology is Australia's largest dual sector university, serving 41,900 students across many fields and a wide range of other clients from numerous industries, professions and communities. In its mission and activities it strongly supports the goals of the Australian higher education system. RMIT is located on three campuses in Melbourne and numerous sites overseas. The challenges it has set itself are immense. It has given itself the task of excelling in both the Higher Education and TAFE sectors, with the aim of bringing them into the closest possible synergy to achieve its goals in education and training, research and community service. </ENTRY>

<ENTRY COLNAME="C2" MOREROWS="0" ROTATE="0" VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT">There is an increasing demand on municipalities to provide more efficient, safer, and more environmentally friendly solutions for managing sewage sludge waste. Concerns about current means of sludge disposal&mdash;incineration, landfill, ocean dumping and land application&mdash;mean that alternative processes need to be developed; processes which are energy efficient, environmentally acceptable and cost effective.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">The focus of this project is to design, construct, commission and operate the world's first commercial scale Enersludge conversion reactor in an integrated sludge processing plant. The Enersludge process converts sewage sludge into both reusable liquid and solid fuels, part of which is then used to produce the hot gases and electricity necessary to run the plant. Excess energy, in the form of oil or electricity will also be available for sale.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">Successful demonstration and commercialisation of this process will provide reduced energy usage, and therefore reduced energy costs, as well as developing a system which could be marketed internationally.</ENTRY>

<ENTRY COLNAME="C2" MOREROWS="0" ROTATE="0" VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT">Australia's tropical regions are expanding rapidly and are expected to accommodate increasing populations in the future. At the moment, a significant number of buildings in tropical regions are inappropriately designed, and are not built to suit the climatic conditions, causing them to be energy inefficient. Reticulation of services and infrastructure to these regions is capital intensive, increasing the overall negative impact on the environment.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">National research into energy efficient tropical buildings is currently uncoordinated, lacks focus and is inadequately linked to wider community, business or user needs.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">This study will:
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">identify the status of tropical research across a broad spectrum of participants;
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">explore innovation options; and
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">consult with government and private sector researchers, designers, regulators,
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">financiers, developers, builders and users of tropical buildings.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">The report will provide recommendations on targets and investment strategies so that funding decisions for future innovation projects can be made on the most recent and comprehensive data.</ENTRY>

<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">The project's cradle to grave approach will address means of reducing embodied energy costs in the production of raw materials and components' manufacture. It will also investigate the level of energy efficiency gains achieved by incorporating light-weight materials into the body of the vehicle. If a vehicle is lighter, it uses less petrol and therefore provides reduced emissions, increased efficiencies, and lower running costs to the consumer.

<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">The project encompasses the development and field testing of a system fed by four gasifier units in parallel. The process will involve gasifying agricultural waste to produce a combustible gas, which in turn will be used to fuel a generator set. These gasifiers can be used in range of applications, including in the cotton industry and at saw mills.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">The project has the potential to offer significant environmental benefits by providing an alternative use for agricultural waste residues, as well as providing commercial benefits in regional areas by developing industries based around these opportunities.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">The resultant gasification system will be suitable for marketing both on a national and international basis.</ENTRY>

<ENTRY COLNAME="C2" MOREROWS="0" ROTATE="0" VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT">In its simplest form, power conditioning is the electrical or electronic conversion of electrical energy from the form in which it is created or supplied, to another form more suitable to the application of the energy. For example, this is especially important when renewably based energy sources generate low voltage power, but the user demands a much higher voltage.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">This project aims to produce the next generation of "universal" power conditioning equipment for use in electricity grids and in standalone/hybrid photovoltaic applications.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">New products that result will have significantly reduced manufacturing costs and will incorporate new, international electromagnetic radiation standards for power electronic equipment.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">This new technology will have immediate application in industrial, utility and alternative energy markets for managing electricity loads both in generation and distribution environments, as well as in converting power.</ENTRY>

Therefore, there are significant benefits in educating architects and building technologists about recent energy and environmental developments, to help reduce energy consumption in buildings' construction and use.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">A previous ERDC investment with The Royal Australian Institute of Architects resulted in the successful Environment Design Guide. The Guide provides regularly updated educational literature for building professionals.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">Following on from the Guide, the first phase of this project will determine what infrastructure is necessary to run a series of national energy and environment seminars. In the seminars, experts would present current information directly to architects and building technologists around Australia.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">The seminars would offer an informal, interactive forum for building professionals to learn and share knowledge and experience on energy and environmental matters, allowing them to enhance the competitiveness of their design service activities.</ENTRY>

<ENTRY COLNAME="C2" MOREROWS="0" ROTATE="0" VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT">The concept of using a roof's surface to either produce or reduce part of a household's energy needs is not new. But the impact on residential building aesthetics has been an ongoing problem of perception for the manufacturers of energy-related, building integrated products.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">Despite the environmental and financial benefits, a large number of property owners are still discouraged by the "add on" nature of products that can produce energy, or skylights and insulation, that reduce the need for energy to be supplied.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">This project is designed to produce a standard, integrated frame that can be used on a range of residential building roof designs&mdash;initially used with colorbond roofs, but eventually with tiled and other roofs. Any product, such as solar water heaters, PV panels or skylights, will be able to be attached to the frame, so that they form part of the roof structure, rather than being an "add on". The energy-related component of the roof will be weatherproof, easy to replace and will last more than 15 years.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">With the Australian residential sector currently using 20% of the nation's non-transport energy, and representing 30% of electricity sales, significant local financial and environmental savings would be achieved by the successful commercialisation of this product. There is also a major export market to Asian countries that are beginning to use PV in residential developments that do not have access to an electricity grid.</ENTRY>

Replacing a large area of solar cells with low cost mirrors, to focus the light onto the cells, can reduce the overall system cost significantly.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">This project is refurbishing the fifteen year old dish array at White Cliffs in New South Wales. The existing steam generating receivers will be replaced with PV receivers, to demonstrate both the durability of the established infrastructure and the ability of the updated system to operate under real conditions. The electricity generated will be fed into the local distribution grid, operated by Australian Inland Energy.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">The modular nature of the system means it can be manufactured economically, minimising establishment costs and providing more flexibility for potential users.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">The project aims to provide the experience and confidence needed to incorporate a low cost, reliable, renewably-based, energy delivery system into the options available for the power industries both in Australia and overseas.</ENTRY>

<ENTRY COLNAME="C2" MOREROWS="0" ROTATE="0" VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT">Many tall buildings in Australia's cities are facing increasing problems with the quality of their power supply. "Harmonic distortion" is a term applied to the varying quality of electricity supply and is commonly associated with the use of modern energy saving plant and equipment. Its presence in a power supply can have serious economic consequences for building owners and tenants, who rely on high quality supply to meet a wide range of operations.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">This project with Unimelb Litd, the commercial arm of the University of Melbourne, will focus on developing computer programs to simplify computations that enable monitoring and mitigation of harmonic distortion.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">Leading building industry consultants, Lincolne Scott Australia, will contribute practical commercial building design and refurbishment experience, as well as knowledge on applying risk management practices in the building industry.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">Potential benefits from developing this system will include a more reliable, safe and efficient suppy of power to building, and a product that can be exported for use in similar circumstances overseas.</ENTRY>

<ENTRY COLNAME="C2" MOREROWS="0" ROTATE="0" VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT">A popular way for Australians to purchase cold soft drinks is through vending machines. However, these are energy intensive and are costly to establishments in energy.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">This project is aiming to reduce the energy consumption of cold drinks vending machines by 60%. Much of the technical work has been conducted through previous projects by the Nida Group.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">In this project Southcorp and Nida aim to produce a machine whose features will allow for a control centre to communicate with other machines to monitor such issues as refilling timing, service needs and security matters. The machine includes a flexible racking system which provides for a broader range of drink container types to meet the changing needs of the market.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">Each machine over a 7 year lifecycle will produce power savings of approximately $1,700 and savings in energy of 13,700 kwh, and a reduction in CO2 of 13.7 tonnes. Vending machines are currently imported into Australis so this will be a good opportunity for an Australian company to begin the manufacture of these machines resulting in both an import replacement opportunity as well as a good export opportunity.</ENTRY>

<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">To respond to these requirements, ABB in collaboration with Sydney University and TransGrid are developing an alternative method of measuring current at high voltage by using optical fibre. A successful new product will use fewer components, occupy less space and will have greater reliability and safety than the conventional equipment.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">Expected successful commercialisation will produce significant benefits to the Australian economy with increased exports, greater employment opportunities, as well as improving the efficiency of electrical transmission networks.</ENTRY>

<ENTRY COLNAME="C2" MOREROWS="0" ROTATE="0" VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT">In simple terms, population pressure on the environment is a function of the complex mix of population, lifestyle, organisation and technology. Some of these interactions have been examined largely through econometric modelling. While this approach is valid and useful, to date, many of the physical processes that underlie the functioning of the modern economy have been dealt with simplistically in these models.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">The CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology therefore is developing a range of physical accounting frameworks (including OzEcco) that address the environmental options and challenges which face Australia over the next 50 years or so. OzEcco is a model of the energy flows within the existing Australian production system. It assumes that under every financial transaction, there is also a physical transaction which requires energy.
<BREAK TYPE="LINE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">OzEcco is a modelling tool that may be used by decision makers, environmentalists, company strategists and others who wish to explore alternative futures and who recognise that, though there are many possible futures, a sustainable future almost certainly requires trade-offs among competing objectives. The OzEcco framework will provide a way to quantify those trade-offs.</ENTRY>
