<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I make this statement to the Senate on behalf of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee to respond to recent disturbing and incorrect media reports about the committee's conduct of its inquiry into consular assistance for Australians travelling abroad. These media reports arose out of attempts by the committee to take evidence in camera from Mr Alastair Gaisford, who was serving in the Australian embassy at Phnom Penh, Cambodia, at the time David Wilson was captured and murdered by the Khmer Rouge in 1994. The committee understands that Mr Gaisford is still an officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but is under suspension. Mr Gaisford refused to give evidence in camera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before dealing in detail with those media reports and the events which gave rise to them, I want to provide some information about the conduct of the inquiry to put them into context. Although originally conceived as an inquiry into matters relating to the David Wilson hostage crisis in Cambodia, the scope of the inquiry was broadened when the Senate referred the matter to the committee on 25 August 1995. Under its terms of reference, the committee was required to conduct an inquiry into the Australian government's consular services and, as part of that inquiry, examine issues and problems in dealing with difficult and complex cases, including that of the David Wilson hostage crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee advertised the inquiry in the national press and called for written submissions to be lodged with the committee. A number of detailed submissions contained adverse comments and these were dealt with by the committee in accordance with the Senate privilege resolutions. The committee decided to release submissions as their authors appeared before the committee in public hearings. Where possible, and in the interests of natural justice, responses to adverse comments in submissions were released at the same time as the submissions.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal election in March 1996, subsequent changes in membership of the committee, including that of chairman, and the need to finalise three other inquiries, resulted in delays in commencing the public hearings in this inquiry. The committee began public hearings on 9 September 1996 and first took evidence from the family of David Wilson on 24 October 1996. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade gave evidence to the committee on the Wilson case on 25 November 1996. The Wilson family was given an opportunity on 11 March 1997 to give further evidence and to respond to the department's evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not until 11 March this year, during his second hearing with the committee, that Mr Peter Wilson, the father of David Wilson, requested the committee to take evidence immediately from Mr Alastair Gaisford. Mr Wilson stated that Mr Gaisford had been the Australian consul in Phnom Penh at the time and was involved with the hostage crisis. He thought Mr Gaisford could make a significant contribution to the inquiry. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> the next day, Mr Gaisford was reported to have said outside the hearing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have no doubt David Wilson would be alive today if we had firmly controlled negotiation pressure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The committee notes that the Wilson family had not nominated Mr Gaisford in their detailed written submission as a person from whom the committee should take evidence. They also did not refer to Mr Gaisford in their first appearance before the committee. We mention this, not as a criticism, but because it is relevant to consideration of subsequent events regarding Mr Gaisford.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, the committee responded to Mr Peter Wilson's request that evidence be taken from Mr Gaisford by inviting him to make a written submission in the first instance. It was explained to Mr Gaisford in the letter of invitation that the committee was following normal committee practice by first seeking a written submission and then deciding, after consideration of the submission, whether to seek further oral evidence at a hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be emphasised that Mr Alastair Gaisford did not make any formal approach 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3399"> to the committee about giving evidence until he responded to the committee's letter of 25 March 1997 inviting him to make a written submission. He did not respond to the advertisements in the national press calling for written submissions. The fact that he knew about the inquiry and the evidence given during the course of the inquiry is beyond doubt. He attended many of the public hearings, including the two days in Melbourne when members of the Wilson family gave evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is understood that Mr Gaisford approached informally the former chairman of the committee, former Senator Bob Woods, in the early stages of the inquiry but no record of these discussions was passed to the committee. He also approached informally at least one other current member of the committee, who responded that he should make a written submission to the committee. However, despite what was said in any private conversation with a member of the committee, that does not constitute any approach to the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the committee invited him to make a written submission, Mr Gaisford began to put obstacles in the way of his contributing to the committee's inquiry. He claimed that he would be giving evidence as an officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and not in a personal capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was pointed out to Mr Gaisford that, if he did not have authorisation to appear on behalf of the department, he would have to appear in a personal capacity. There is no other capacity in which he could appear. The committee also made it clear to Mr Gaisford that, if he wanted to appear on behalf of the department, it was his responsibility to seek the necessary authorisation from the secretary to his department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Gaisford told the committee in his letter of 31 March 1997 that his address was the North Asia Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. He has refused to give the committee any other address or telephone number. However, as stated earlier, the committee understands that he is an officer under suspension from the department 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and is not entitled to enter departmental premises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee did not believe, in the circumstances, that the address that he had given the committee was an appropriate address for official correspondence, particularly as the department did not have a forwarding address for him. Mr Gaisford collected the committee's mail directed to him from the committee secretariat. The committee has on occasion had to use intermediaries to contact him. The committee notes that Mr Gaisford used departmental letterhead for all his letters to the committee, despite the fact that he is under suspension and is not writing on behalf of the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Gaisford advised the committee in his letter of 31 March 1997 that he believed parliamentary privilege would not protect him adequately and that action under other Commonwealth legislation might be taken against him in respect of evidence given to the committee. He requested the committee to obtain written advice from the Clerk of the Senate to clarify the protection afforded by the Parliamentary Privileges Act. Such advice was obtained from the clerk and attached to the committee's letter dated 17 April 1997 to Mr Gaisford. Mr Gaisford eventually lodged his written submission with the committee on 29 April 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to Mr Gaisford's assertion in his submission that he was the Australian Consul in Phnom Penh, the committee was informed recently by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that Mr Gaisford was not the consul at the time of the Wilson hostage crisis. According to the embassy's diplomatic list dated 18 July 1994, which was provided to the Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation on 28 July 1994, Mr Gaisford was listed as second secretary. Another officer was listed as first secretary and consul.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee gave careful consideration to Mr Gaisford's submission, which was only a summary submission with a list of topics that he said he would address in a hearing. Despite the incomplete nature of Mr Gaisford's submission, the committee nevertheless decided to invite Mr Gaisford to give 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3400"> oral evidence at a hearing. It was further decided that the hearing would be held in camera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, on 6 May 1997, the committee invited Mr Gaisford to give evidence to the committee on 12 May 1997. The next day, Mr Gaisford handed the committee a letter seeking reasons for hearing his evidence in camera. The committee responded on 8 May 1997 stating, among other things, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unlike other parties in this inquiry, who responded to public advertisements by giving the Committee detailed submissions, you have provided a summary submission late in the inquiry. Some of the other submissions contained adverse comments which were dealt with in accordance with Senate procedures to ensure that the right of individuals to natural justice was not prejudiced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In your case, after further consideration and a detailed study of your summary submission, the Committee is not satisfied that your evidence will not reflect adversely on another person. Accordingly, under Privilege Resolution 1 (11), the Committee has decided to hold the hearing in camera. It will decide subsequently whether to release the transcript of evidence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In his letter of 7 May 1997 Mr Gaisford requested that in any hearing he be accompanied by counsel at the committee's expense. Although the committee was unconvinced by Mr Gaisford's need to be accompanied by counsel, it did not object to counsel being present at Mr Gaisford's expense. It is not the practice of Senate references committees to pay counsel's costs and expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About 3.15 p.m. on Friday, 9 May 1997, Mr Gaisford delivered another letter to the committee saying that he would not give evidence to the committee in camera. In the letter Mr Gaisford requested the committee to revoke its decision to hold the hearing in camera. At about 5.10 p.m. that day, he returned to the committee secretariat asking whether the committee had revoked its decision. He was told that, as members of the committee were travelling back to their homes in their respective states, it was impossible to convene a meeting of the committee between 3.15 p.m. and 5.10 p.m. to consider Mr Gaisford's letter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was also told that any revocation of the committee's decision to hold the hearing in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> camera would require a further decision of the committee; the chairman did not have the authority to revoke unilaterally the committee's decision. He was told that the committee could not meet before Monday. Mr Gaisford then handed over a further letter to the committee regretting the committee's decision. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is apparent that Mr Gaisford made contact with Mr Tim Wilson, the brother of David Wilson, and told him that the committee was requesting that he give evidence in camera, not in public. Mr Wilson then made a statement to the media, which was reported on the ABC's early edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS>, saying that he had lost faith with the committee and that the committee was a waste of time. In the later edition of ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS>, I as the chairman of the committee made a statement confirming that Mr Gaisford had been invited to give evidence in camera, that this was being done in accordance with normal committee procedures but that I was not in a position at the time to go into details of why the committee had decided to take Mr Gaisford's evidence in camera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Monday, 12 May 1997, Mr Peter Wilson and Mr Tim Wilson appeared on the Channel 9 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Today</EMPHASIS> show and continued to disparage the committee's decision to take evidence from Mr Gaisford in camera. They accused the committee of taking part in a cover&hyphen;up. Press reports in several newspapers over the weekend and Monday also reported the comments of the Wilson family and Mr Gaisford on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Monday, 12 May 1997, the committee met to consider the next step in this matter. It decided to direct Mr Gaisford to appear at an in camera hearing on 14 May 1997. Although the committee passed a message to Mr Gaisford through an intermediary that it wanted to communicate with him, Mr Gaisford has not made contact with the committee. The committee reached the conclusion yesterday that this approach would not be worth pursuing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee believes, however, that it cannot remain silent, because the public comments of the Wilson family, provoked by Mr Gaisford, cast serious aspersions on the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3401"> integrity of the committee and the Senate. The committee, therefore, decided that the appropriate course of action is to place the facts of this matter before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee prefers all evidence to be given in public, as is the practice of Senate committees. As the Wilson family made a detailed submission to the committee early in the inquiry in response to the advertisement, the committee was able to act in accordance with Senate procedure resolutions and, where necessary, seek responses from people who were subjected to adverse criticism. Mr Gaisford's very late contribution as a summary submission with no details or evidence to substantiate his claims is a matter of concern to the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee gave careful consideration to Mr Gaisford's summary submission. Mr Gaisford made a number of serious general accusations about the handling of the David Wilson hostage crisis without any evidence to support his claims. He provided as an appendix to his submission a list of topics on which he wants to address the committee. The emotive way in which he cast some of those topics suggested to the committee that he might publicly make adverse comments about individuals involved in this case. The committee had reservations about the nature of the evidence he would give at a hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the committee wanted to take evidence from him, as he was involved in the hostage crisis and may be able to contribute to the committee's understanding of the issues in this case. On the basis of the submission alone, the committee was not satisfied that he would not make adverse comments based on unsubstantiated claims at a hearing. Should Mr Gaisford make adverse comments in his evidence, those affected by his comments would not be able to defend their actions and reputations at the time. They would clearly be denied natural justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also took into account Mr Gaisford's approach to the committee. Unlike the Wilson family and other witnesses, who tried to assist the committee in its inquiry, Mr Gaisford's approach was quite the contrary, aggressively raising obstacles at every turn. It reached the point where I had to warn Mr 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Gaisford twice not to harass members of the committee and the secretariat and that if he continued this aggressive approach I would report the matter to the Clerk of the Senate, which I eventually did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the nature of his submission, his aggressive approach to the committee and his focus on procedural matters rather than the content of his evidence, the committee decided that it should hear Mr Gaisford in camera. It was the intention of the committee that if Mr Gaisford's evidence conformed to normal standards of evidence it would be released publicly. The committee is quite prepared to release criticisms of the actions of individuals if there is evidence to support those criticisms and there is an opportunity for those people subject to adverse comment to respond in accordance with Senate procedures. The committee is not prepared to allow unsubstantiated claims to be made against individuals under parliamentary privilege.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since making its original decision to hear Mr Gaisford in camera, the committee has been made aware of evidence given by Mr Gaisford and other members of the DFAT Reform Group to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on its inquiry into the management and operations of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 1992. In its report, the committee concluded that: many of the specific allegations made by the DFAT Reform Group were seriously inaccurate; in none of the cases reviewed by the committee was there sufficient evidence to justify action against any individual and, in a significant number of cases, the allegations against individuals were clearly disproved; those cases which were partly or largely substantiated, including one nominated by Mr Carroll as significant, were of minor importance; and there was no evidence of any cover&hyphen;up of improper or illegal behaviour. The committee believes that these comments lend weight to the committee's concern about evidence which might be given by Mr Gaisford in this inquiry and the committee's decision to hear Mr Gaisford in camera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make it clear on behalf of the committee that the committee is considering 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3402"> seriously all the issues in this inquiry. With its decision to take evidence in camera from Mr Gaisford, the committee was following established Senate practice of ensuring the protection of innocent people from possible unsubstantiated claims made under parliamentary privilege. The committee has no intention of withholding significant relevant information from the Senate or the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Gaisford has had ample opportunity to make a contribution to this inquiry going back to August 1995 when the inquiry was established. If he had had any concern about protection afforded by parliamentary privilege in respect of evidence he might give to the committee, this could have been resolved quickly at any time, as it was when he recently sought from the committee written advice from the Clerk of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee believes that if Mr Gaisford had pertinent information about the handling of the David Wilson hostage crisis which could assist the committee he should have come forward early in the inquiry, as did other people. But even when the committee invited him to make a submission at the request of Mr Peter Wilson, he began a series of procedural arguments with the committee rather than make a substantive submission which contained his views and the evidence to support them. A person wanting to give evidence would normally assist and cooperate with the committee to ensure that the committee received relevant information. In this case, this did not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee is very concerned that the actions of Mr Gaisford have unnecessarily put additional pressure on the Wilson family, the relatives of the late David Wilson. The fact that they felt compelled to speak out on this matter is regrettable. It was frustrating for me and the committee that we were not in a position to assuage the doubts of the Wilson family at the time. By making this statement today, this important matter is brought into the public arena in its proper context. This obviously could not be done and nor should it be done through the media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to point out that all decisions made by the committee in relation to Mr Gaisford were unanimous. I thank the Senate for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> extending my time to make this statement. I seek leave to table all the correspondence between the committee and Mr Gaisford, Mr Gaisford's submission, other relevant correspondence and transcripts of media reports.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 (the tariff act) to simplify the excise treatment of stabilised crude petroleum oil (crude oil) and liquid petroleum gas (LPG). This bill is part of a legislative package which includes amendments to the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of sections 6B, 6C and 6D of the tariff act set out the methods of calculating the excise duty on stabilised crude petroleum oil (crude oil). Section 6B governs the excise duty on old oil, section 6C governs the excise duty on new oil and section 6D governs the excise duty on intermediate oil. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under each of these provisions, the amount of duty in respect of each type of crude oil is ascertained by reference to the prescribed production area from which the oil is produced and to the prescribed 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3404"> division of a financial year during which the oil is entered for home consumption.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under section 6B, "prescribed division" in relation to a financial year means one of 36 divisions in that year. Basically there are 3 divisions in each month of a year and this means that the amount of excise duty on crude oil is required to be calculated 36 times per financial year. The payment of excise duty is also made 36 times per year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This method of continuous calculation and payment of excise duty on crude oil was first introduced in 1983 with the intention of ensuring the systematic collection of excise during a financial year. At that time, the production of excisable crude oil was very high, with excise collections of $4.2 billion in 1984/85 mainly from the Bass Strait region, and this method resulted in relatively even payments of excise throughout the financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1987, amendments were made to the method as a result of the deregulation of the crude oil market. The amount of excise duty payable is now based on the volume weighted average of prices realised from the sales of excisable stabilised crude oil by Australian producers (the VOLWARE price of the crude oil). These prices are determined under the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987 (the prices act) and are determined on a monthly basis. The timing of the calculation and payment of excise duty was not changed. The amount continues to be calculated and paid 36 times per financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As previously referred to, the present method of calculation and payment of excise duty was introduced when the production of excisable crude oil was very high. In 1990, however, the petroleum resource rent tax regime was extended to Bass Strait with the result that only 3 developments in the coastal waters off Western Australia and Queensland are presently subject to excise duty. In 1995/96, the amount of excise on crude oil was only $12.2 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is considered that, with such reduced amounts of excise duty being imposed upon crude oil, the requirement that the duty be calculated and paid 36 times during a financial year now places a disproportionate administrative burden upon crude oil producers and the government. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the tariff act to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> increase the length of the prescribed divisions from the current period of 8, 9, 10 or 11 days to a calendar month, thereby decreasing the number of prescribed divisions from 36 per financial year to 12 per financial year. This will mean the amount of excise duty will only be required to be calculated 12 times per year; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> as a consequence of this, require the payment of excise duty 12 times per year in place of 36 times per year. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments require consequential amendments to the calculation of VOLWARE prices under the prices act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the calculation and payment of excise duty is based around the financial year, it is proposed that the amendments to both the tariff act and the prices act will commence on 1 July 1997 to avoid any difficulties that may arise from the overlap of the two different timing arrangements during a financial year.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments to the tariff act and the prices act have been developed after consultation with the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also amends the tariff act by removing LPG from the ambit of the tariff act. At present, LPG produced from offshore fields that came into production after 17 August 1977 is excisable under sub&hyphen;item 17(C) of the Schedule. The rate of excise on LPG is "Free". With the extension of the resource rent tax regime to Bass Strait in 1990, however, the only offshore fields that are subject to the excise regime are those on the North West Shelf. LPG is being produced on the North West Shelf and is excise free. LPG produced from onshore fields is excise exempt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is, therefore, proposed to make the production of LPG excise exempt by removing LPG from the ambit of the tariff act. This will remove the unnecessary administrative burden on producers of LPG and the government and will bring the treatment of offshore LPG production in line with the onshore LPG production.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also proposes decreases in the rates of excise duty on aviation gasoline (avgas) and aviation kerosene (avtur) of 0.75 cents per litre with effect from 1 September 1996. The decreases in the excise duty on avgas and avtur were the result of the over&hyphen;collection of excise duty on these products during 1995&hyphen;1996. The reductions also take account of the reduction in the operating costs of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and forecast growth in airline activity which will lead to increases in consumption of aviation fuels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decreases were proposed in Excise Tariff Proposal No. 1 of 1996 which was tabled in the House of Representatives on 16 September 1996 and took effect on 1 September 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments, including their financial impact, are outlined in greater detail in the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PETROLEUM EXCISE (PRICES) AMENDMENT BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987 to simplify the crude oil excise calculation and collection regime. Industry supports these changes. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3405">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987 allows for the determination, by the Minister for Resources and Energy, of the volume weighted average of realised (VOLWARE) prices for each excisable crude oil producing region each month; this is the price for excise purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the deregulation of the oil industry in 1988 the petroleum secondary taxation regime has altered considerably. At that time the bass strait oil producing region was the only excisable crude oil producing region in Australia. In 1990 the PRRT replaced the excise regime in Bass Strait and PRRT applied to all offshore regions except the North West Shelf project area. However Commonwealth excise continued to apply in state/territory waters, onshore and to the North West Shelf. The fields which are currently subject to excise are: the Jackson field in south west Queensland and the Saladin and the Harriet/Lenita fields in Western Australian coastal waters. These three fields are significantly smaller crude oil producers than the Bass Strait region, with sales directly to ship compared to Bass Strait where pipeline sales were continuous. During 1997&hyphen;98 the Wanaea field in the North West Shelf region is expected to become excisable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently excise is collected thrice monthly with payment of excise occurring before the producers receive payment for the oil sold. To compensate for this early payment of excise, the volware price calculation allows a compensation factor called `credit terms compensation' for part of the time difference between excise payment and receipt of payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act also imposes the obligation to determine VOLWARE prices for oil producing regions even though their production rate is below the level at which excise liability occurs. These prices exist in three forms:  a reference price for the month ahead; an interim VOLWARE price for the month immediately past; and a final volware price when all transaction data is complete. Depending on the date of discovery, the rate at which excise is levied is based on progressive production tranches with some annual production being excisable at a zero rate. This bill removes the necessity to determine volware prices for oil producing regions whose annual production is below the first excisable tranche, leading to administrative savings for industry and government. If the annualised production increases to 80 per cent of the first excise tranche the determination of volware prices could be reintroduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, together with the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997, which are presented together as a legislative package, will change the excise collection regime from three times each calendar month to monthly, therefore negating the requirement for the determination of a reference price. In order to maintain revenue neutrality the 15

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Broadcasting Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 is part of a legislative package, the primary purpose of which is to make commercial radio and commercial television licences allocated under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 subject to the same annual licence fee arrangements as apply to commercial broadcasting licences that were granted under the former Broadcasting Act 1942. This bill also proposes to correct an unintended consequence in the operation of the cross media rules relating to the common control of a commercial radio licence and an associated small newspaper.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The related bills in this legislative package, the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1997 and the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1997, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3406"> will amend the Radio Licence Fees Act 1964 and the Television Licence Fees Act 1964 to make commercial licences allocated under the Broadcasting Services Act subject to the payment of annual licence fees based on their gross earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act in order to make provision for the administration of annual licence fees payable under the Licence Fees Acts. The bill also makes consequential amendments to the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1992 and repeals various redundant provisions in that act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Senators may recall that, when parliament passed the Broadcasting Services Act in 1992, the issue of whether to make new commercial licences (ie, licences allocated after commencement of the Act) subject to licence fees was left unresolved, pending determination of the most appropriate method of recovering economic rents from commercial broadcasters. However, commercial broadcasting licences granted prior to commencement of the new Act continued to be subject to the payment of annual licence fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Options identified for the payment of licence fees by new commercial broadcasters included a one&hyphen;off payment on the allocation of a licence; ongoing fees based on the value of the spectrum used; ongoing fees based on the income derived from use of the spectrum; or a hybrid system combining two or more of these components.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Honourable Senators will appreciate, a pure price&hyphen;based allocation system attempts to recover, up&hyphen;front and in a single payment, all economic rents generated by the use of the radiofrequency spectrum and ownership of a licence. Such a system works best under conditions of effective competition where there is complete market information and certainty, but is less effective where there is limited commercial interest in new licence opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Analysis by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics in 1995 suggested that new licensees are likely to earn less profits than existing broadcasters in the area and that this will affect the premium bid for licences at auction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, under provisions for the allocation of licences in under&hyphen;served single service markets, many of the new licences are being allocated for a charge which reflects no more than the recovery of costs incurred by the Australian Broadcasting Authority in planning and allocating the licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current arrangements are considered to be inequitable. New players are able to purchase, comparatively cheaply at auction, a right to compete with incumbents who pay annual fees and who in the past bore the cost of proving eligibility under the former merit&hyphen;based allocation process or, in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> case of some radio incumbents, paid high prices for the right to convert their AM licences to FM.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the circumstances, the government has decided that the best way to ensure fair treatment between incumbent licensees and new licensees, and to ensure that economic rents are not lost to the Commonwealth in respect of new licences, is to apply fees to all commercial licences based on annual gross earnings of the commercial broadcasters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the legislative package before the Senate today, of which this bill is an important part, will extend the current provisions to licences issued by the Australian Broadcasting Authority in its price&hyphen;based allocation process under the Broadcasting Services Act, as well as to second licences in single service markets allocated via the administrative allocation mechanisms in the Broadcasting Services Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two prime components of the broadcasting tax regime remain unaltered. Licensees will pay a one&hyphen;off, up front fee on the allocation of a new commercial licence and an annual fee, which will recover the economic rents due to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Opportunity is also being taken in the bill to correct an unintended consequence in the operation of the cross media rules with respect to control of a commercial radio licence and a small newspaper associated with its licence area. An effect of these provisions is that they apply to all newspapers with 50% of their circulation in the commercial broadcaster's licence area even if that circulation is very limited in comparison with the total population of the relevant licence area and their level of influence in the licence area is correspondingly minimal. The bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act to exclude newspapers with a circulation of less than 2% of a commercial radio broadcaster's licence area population from the cross media rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The financial impact of this and the other two bills in the legislative package in respect of extending annual licence fees to all commercial radio and television licences is difficult to forecast precisely because of a number of variables. These include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the number of new commercial broadcasting licences that will be made available by the Australian Broadcasting Authority in the future;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the number of these new licences that will be actually taken up;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the gross earnings of new licensees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the legislative package, when it comes into effect, is expected to have a progressively and increasing positive net effect on the budget level

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">DAIRY PRODUCE LEVY (No. 1) AMENDMENT BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill has two purposes. Firstly, this bill, in conjunction with the Australian Animal Health Council (Live&hyphen;stock Industries) Funding Amendment Bill 1997, will establish a statutory levy to fund the dairy industry's contribution to the Australian Animal Health Council Limited. Secondly, this bill will double the maximum research levy rate specified in the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Act 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Animal Health Council Limited, or AAHC for short, has been established as Australia's peak animal health body. Its mission is to ensure that Australia's animal health service system is capable of maintaining acceptable national animal health standards, which meet both consumer needs and market requirements in domestic and international markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AAHC is jointly owned and funded by the commonwealth, state governments, the northern territory government and the peak representative bodies of Australia's livestock industries, including the Australian Dairy Farmers' Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To date, the dairy industry's contribution to AAHC has been met from surplus monies paid to the dairy research and development corporation upon cessation of the exotic animal disease program and supplemented by a payment from the Australian dairy corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The peak industry body, the Australian Dairy Industry Council has sought the establishment of a levy mechanism as a transparent means of meeting the industry's funding commitment to the AAHC, as currently occurs with Australia's other livestock industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The levy would be imposed in the same manner as other dairy industry levies, that is, on the milk fat and protein content of an individual producer's milk supply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need to increase the maximum research levy rate has arisen because the current operational research levy rate, which partially funds the activities of Dairy Research and Development Corporation, is very close to the legislated maximum rate. The present situation provides very little scope for further increases and may significantly curtail the ability of the dairy research and development corporation to respond to the needs of the industry in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would point out that a doubling of the maximum research levy will not automatically lead to a rise in the actual research levy rate paid by producers. Rather, it will provide scope for the dairy industry to seek government approval for an increase in the actual levy rate, as the need arises. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increase in the maximum research levy rate has the full support of the Australian Dairy Industry Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the dairy industry has enjoyed significant growth in recent years, with milk production in 1996/97 expected to pass 9 billion litres for the first time on record. Around half of this production will be exported with the value of exports expected to be about $1.8 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will enhance the capacity of the dairy industry to undertake animal health and research and development activities which, in turn, will contribute to further industry growth and improved competitiveness in domestic and international markets.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will keep my comments very brief. This issue has been exhaustively canvassed. I want to say again for the record that, in terms of what was originally described as a package of legislation relating to a surcharge, Labor would not support the third reading of these matters for a number of very important and critical reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, in respect of its application supposedly to higher income earners&mdash;those earning more than $70,000&mdash;the effect of the tax and the way it is being collected, it will still hit a very substantial number of lower and middle income earners, particularly those earning between $35,000 and $70,000 a year. Secondly, it will also hurt workers who incur a redundancy, for example, in the event of an eligible termination payment being made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, there is the very costly administrative nature of collecting this new tax. Every fund member will have to pay additional administrative costs that will be incurred in the collection of this new tax. Fourthly, we do not know yet whether one state is going to collect this new tax. Fifthly, there are still constitutional doubts over the validity of these new tax provisions. Finally and most importantly, for the last nine months since the August budget last year, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has very dishonestly continued to describe these measures as a surcharge when it was a tax.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone in Australia knows this new $500 million a year so-called surcharge is a tax. What is at least pleasing at last is that, following the action in this Senate, in the House of Representatives this Liberal government through the Treasurer&mdash;and Mr Costello has been a very arrogant Treasurer on this package of measures&mdash;has finally admitted and accepted the Senate's amendment that it is a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a pity the government was not so honest when it first announced this initiative. It is a very dishonest approach to claim that it was a surcharge and not a tax. It was the government's biggest revenue raising measure in the budget announced last year&mdash;half a billion dollars a year. It is a tax, and it breaches that fundamental commitment given by the Liberal-National Party at the last election: no increase in existing taxes and no new taxes.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to take the unusual step of making a comment at the third reading stage on these particular measures. As Senator Sherry said, they were exhaustively discussed in this chamber over a period of time. It is correct that these measures will be placing a very heavy burden upon existing superannuation funds. These measures will place those funds at a severe disadvantage to the RSAs, because it is those funds which are now required, retrospectively, to do all the job for the government, which it should have been able to do by calling it a tax in the first place and levying it as a tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures that have now been approved by the House of Representatives permit banks to establish retirement savings accounts into which employers can make compulsory superannuation payments, without trustee&hyphen;like protection for those employees and their dependants for whom the retirement savings accounts have been established. Of course, this is in marked contrast to the fiduciary duties that are imposed on the superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we adopted in the committee some time ago my amendment which imposed a fiduciary duty on the directors of retirement savings accounts in banks, I wondered why 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3410"> such pressure was starting to be applied from certain of the major commercial banks. It was very heavily applied. I indicated from my office that I was fully briefed on the matter. I, of course, received the correspondence from the banks on the matter and studied it. But still they were not satisfied. They were concerned about it, so they went around recruiting people to do their work for them. Sadly enough, some of those people were from the permanent building societies and some credit unions. Unfortunately, they were conned by the touts for the banks to do their work for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having read the budget fine print, I now know why the banks were so concerned about that particular amendment of mine. If you have a look at it, what the budget has done is propose that employers will be forced to offer bank RSAs to employees for the purposes of the employer putting the compulsory contribution into those bank RSAs. Frankly, the measures that are in the budget also will result in the overriding of award provisions which now nominate superannuation funds in the interests of the employees. That is what the government has done.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For existing employees as well&mdash;I take that point, Senator Sherry. All of the budget measures are designed to encourage a shift of super savings to the banks. I ask senators to put themselves in the position of an employer who has an overdraft burden with a particular bank.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, you know how that feels, Senator. Put yourself in that situation. Wouldn't there be a great deal of pressure on those employers to make sure that their employees were in the bank which held the overdraft for that particular company?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">  What that will mean is that the budget is making those employers touts for the banks, and the superannuation payments made by employees is the bargaining chip. I do not think that is fair. The budget measures also make superannuation savings less attractive as in the future they are intended to be locked up until a person reaches age 60, whilst 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> interest on ordinary bank deposits will get a 15 per cent tax rebate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, I have been involved in credit unions for 35 years, since very early in the piece. I want to give a message to the credit unions. I am sorry that they were conned by the banks. Have a look at page 183 of Budget Paper No. 2. What are the measures outlined there proposing? They are proposing that the banks will be positioned by the budget to be better placed to take over building societies and credit unions because of the tax changes to facilitate conversion of co-operatively owned financial institutions to shareholder owned companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the rub. First the government agrees with the banks to set up RSAs. Then in other budget measures it encourages employers to work on their employees to funnel the compulsory contributions into the RSAs, to knock off award provisions nominating the particular superannuation funds and make payments to those less attractive than others. Then a situation is set up where the banks can gobble up co-operatively owned financial institutions, such as building societies and credit unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, in two or three years time in this country, we will ultimately see&mdash;mark my words&mdash;the major four banks gobbling up numbers of credit unions and building societies. I ask the Senate: have the banks been such good corporate citizens over the last 10 years to deserve that sort of pat on the back?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When people vote, I want them to understand exactly what they are voting on. I am trying to be helpful, Senator Faulkner. Much of our discussion yesterday was about extending the completion of the five-year period to the year 2002. The amendments that do that are those contained in requests 2 and 3 on page B94BA453. The other three relate to the issue of whether the final figure in reserve should be 30 per cent of the total or $300 million. The figure of $300 million was put in when we believed that the capital contribution would be $1 billion. So 30 per cent was the expression put in the bill, although we had in mind&mdash;and we have said publicly many times&mdash;that the figure that we were anticipating would therefore be in reserve would be $300 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we increased the capital contribution to the fund, the effect of that, without amending this bill&mdash;of course, this bill was introduced before the decision to increase the capital fund&mdash;would have been to increase the amount that had to be left over at the end of the period of time. That was not our intention. It was still our intention, even though we had more money in the fund, to limit the amount left over to $300 million.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the committee decides not to accept our amendment, the effect will be that more money has to be left over at the end of the period. I am not sure that that is what the committee is really wanting to do because we obviously want to expend, to the year 2002, right up to the total of the fund less $300 million, not the total of the fund less&mdash;I am advised&mdash;$367 million. That is why we are seeking to amend the bill in terms of the first set of requests: Nos. 4,5 and 6. There are two distinctly different questions, I would suggest, to the committee. I have heard some objection, particularly from my friend Senator Faulkner that the term of the trust should not be extended out to 2002, but I have not actually heard anyone argue against the principle that the remaining figure should be $300 million rather than $367 million. I ask the committee to bear that in mind when we vote.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before Senator Hill comments, I think it should be made very clear to Senator Brown&mdash;and both the current minister and the former minister understand what happened in the wet tropics. You have got to understand that often in these areas it is private land. People do expect to get something when they set their land aside, although they may not get the benefit for 20 years. But I do pay a compliment to Senator Faulkner that what has happened in the wet tropics has been a great advantage. I was travelling around some of areas over the weekend and looking at areas where trees have been planted; there is an opportunity now to plant more trees in that area. I think there are areas there that should never have been cleared for dairy farming, but that is a completely different matter, because of the terrain and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only way we are going to make a lasting difference there is to give people who decide to put these areas back into trees an opportunity to recover something, albeit in 20 or 40 years time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;True enough. I certainly would plead guilty on that count. Why then, if they are such good programs, have they been cut, delayed or rebadged? That is the truth about it. Why have they been rolled in, we hope, to the Natural Heritage Trust program and these very successful Labor government initiatives repackaged and sold as new programs from the coalition government?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what is happening in relation to the sorts of programs that you and Senator Brown have been debating. That is the truth of the matter. It is a pretty miserable record on behalf of the government and a very poor performance by you in terms of defending the natural environment in this country through successive budgets and protecting the natural environment in this budget. I think you ought to be ashamed of yourself in terms of that contribution as Australia's environment minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let me come back to the question before the chair&mdash;that is, the requests and amendments that the government is proposing. The issue is this: the government is proposing that its $1.149 billion commitment during the election campaign&mdash;the great environmental con; the Telstra environment link&mdash;a commitment to funding promised over five years and promised to be over and above the forward estimates of the previous Labor administration, now stands exposed as money not above the forward estimates of either the environment department or, for that matter, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. It is not extra money at all and not money over five years. You are now trying to gild the lily and string it out over six years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are the issues that are before the committee now. It is on those issues as well as the other matters in relation to the import 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ant programs that have been the subject of debate between Senator Hill and Senator Brown. That is an important debate, and let's have it at the appropriate time. The issue before us now is the breach of the commitment that this Liberal government made during the election campaign to fund the environment over five years to the tune of $1.149 billion on top of the forward estimates of the previous Labor administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what is before us in black and white. What has been exposed during this committee stage debate is the fact that this is an open and shut case&mdash;a black and white case&mdash;of Senator Hill and the Liberal government breaking their word, breaching their commitment and deceiving the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for that reason that the opposition will not accept these government amendments. We do not want to see Senator Hill get away with it. Perhaps the committee will agree with him. Perhaps the Senate will support this breach of commitment. Perhaps they will allow the big lie, the big con, the big deception of the election campaign to be enshrined in this piece of legislation. I hope not. I hope Senator Hill and the government will be kept to their word. I hope that they will be exposed for their deceit during the election campaign and the trickery of the scam that is before us now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the committee to focus on the issue before the chair and say to the government, `No, we won't let you get away with this environmental con, with this trick by the government. We won't let you get away with this deceit.' It is for those reasons that I would urge the committee to defeat the government amendments and government requests that are before the chair.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment is so that the annual report about the reserve&mdash;that is, about the fund&mdash;requires the ministers to include details of all disbursements from the reserve and the reasons for decisions relating to those disbursements. It is a pretty sensible and standard way of reporting here. It simply says, `Let us see what the ministers were aiming to do when they allocated the money.' They are the board. They are the total authority. Let us in the report find out whether they were successful in achieving that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me again to the matter of native vegetation. Under the scheme, according to the latest figures, the minister is allocating $328.6 million. Presumably that includes extra money from Senator Harradine's efforts. Of this, a fifth goes to stopping clearing of native vegetation in Australia&mdash;that is, $64 million&mdash;and four-fifths goes to revegetation, $254 million. What I would like to know from the minister is how many hectares of revegetation he expects that $254 million is going to create, how much of it is going to be planted as local native vegetation and how much of it is going  to be commercial trees or other forms of plantation or tree growing.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3419"> Some $22 million is a large sum in itself, but it is not a large proportion of $1.25 billion. As I understand it, that program, which is administered by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, is in existence at the moment and will be continued. It has a regime of practice under which it operates and there is no secret about that. I really cannot see the point of the question. I cannot see that it has anything to do with this clause that we are debating either.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point of the question is that this is legislation to spend public moneys on the repair or the enhancement of the environment. I cannot see how commercial tree planting operations are covered by those aims. The minister says that this program has been in operation before. That immediately raises the question: are moneys from the Natural Heritage Trust Fund being diverted into other government programs? We had a long and unsatisfactory debate about that last night where the minister refused to accept an amendment from this side of the chamber which would prevent states from double shuffling money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now need to look at whether government is internally shuffling money in the Natural Heritage Trust Fund to give to the loggers, the tree planters, the plantation owners and goodness knows which companies. It is a blatant question up-front, but the minister simply has to answer it. How is commercial tree planting with a commercial imperative going to fulfil the desired outcome of environmental excellence and environmental enhancement? It is a pretty simple question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a lot of money, no matter what the minister says, and it is money that ought to be going towards the prime objective of enhancing Australia's environmental future. I cannot see how you can justify putting $22 million of this fund into commercial tree planting operations which are for profit when there is so much to be done in terms of stopping the awesome destruction of native vegetation across the country with the loss of biodiversity, the destruction of native forests, including rainforests, and the loss of the environmental amenity.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Could the minister also say why $4 is being spent on revegetation for every dollar that is being spent on stopping the destruction of current native cover? In other words, you are spending four times as much on repair as you are spending on stopping the damage. One has to wonder whether that is not simply a formula for a much bigger repair requirement further down the line. What is your answer to that, minister?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My first answer is that we are debating the form of the annual report. We are not debating programs under the trust at all. We have had that debate, except Senator Brown will not acknowledge it. The farm forestry program is in existence at the moment and does have incidental benefits in terms of what flows to the environment from sustainable agriculture. For us to support and encourage sustainable agriculture will provide more environmental benefits than practically anything else we can do in this country as we apply it to regional and rural Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, Senator Brown cannot get his mind around that. He keeps saying that this is for profit. Farmers who have profitable enterprises will be good for the environment. Farmers who are unprofitable are likely to be less good for the environment. If we can support farmers to conduct their farming in a sustainable way, which will include the capacity to harvest some timber, then we will be taking a positive step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The landcare movement is a world that Senator Brown is not part of&mdash;a world of hundreds of thousands of Australians who are now trying to run their own lives and their own businesses in a sustainable way. They will be the people who will make the difference. They will be the people that we want to support. They are people that we are seeking to invest in. That is what this is all about. This has nothing to do with the clause that we are debating.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has got everything to do with the clause that is being debated because the clause is saying that an annual report will need to establish how the ministers are com 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3420"> plying with their obligations under the act, which has very specific aims of protecting the environment. I am at the outset saying that sections of tens of millions of dollars of spending here seem to flout those aims right at the outset.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a pretty sensible thing for the committee to say, `Before we get to the first annual report'&mdash;if this amendment is passed&mdash;`we have got a contradiction in what the minister is saying because the obligations are for environmental and ecological sustainability and excellence, but here he is earmarking tens of millions of dollars for commercial forestry arrangements, which begin, of course, with commercial tree planting.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's national vegetation initiative includes a clause which says that a further amount, yet to be decided, will be invested in the farm forestry program&mdash;that is, plantations. I want the minister to tell the committee what that further unspecified amount is that the minister reserves unto himself to know. He may be able to tell the committee now what that amount is. Obviously it will go explicitly to plantation creation. I want to know from the minister if that plantation is going to be of exotic species and if there are going to be any restriction on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again&mdash;and this is very particular&mdash;will the minister give a commitment to this committee that native vegetation clearance will not be allowed for those people who get funding under this Natural Heritage Trust Fund? I want to minister to give a commitment that it will not be allowed as a lead&hyphen;in to commercial farm operations, which he is spending money out of this fund for, and that farm operators who are clearing native vegetation on their farm will not be given money for repair of damage elsewhere on the farm. In other words, there has to be a whole farm plan which does not allow the damage to continue while government funds are put to ameliorating the effects of past damage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot add anything further to the debate that Senator Brown is determined to continue, because he seeks to obstruct the passage of this bill. This is the fourth day, I think, we have been 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> debating it. Most of Australia is enthusiastic about wanting the bill to pass and for us to get on and implement the programs. Senator Brown and a very small band of stragglers want to oppose it because they feel in some way that their legitimacy in the environment debate is being overtaken by the hundreds of thousands of Australians who are out on the ground doing good works and actually improving the environment for themselves and future generations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to Senator Brown's amendment we are addressing on the annual reports in which he is requiring further information to be provided, the response of the government is that the bill already requires financial statements on the operation of the trust to be included in the annual report. The annual report must also include the Auditor-General's report on those statements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Details of all grants provided from the trust will be publicly available in accordance with the normal administrative arrangements for such grants. To include the requirements that he is seeking is, therefore, not necessary and would also create an unreasonable administrative burden, particularly if reasons for all disbursements from the trust must be included in the annual report, bearing in mind that there may be several thousand community grants given annually.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to any particular project, the information can be supplied on request. If anyone wants reasons for a particular decision, they can seek those reasons. This is in accordance with the normal government decision making arrangements and responsibilities. Also they may be able to require it under the ADJR Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the matters Senator Brown is seeking are in our view already adequately covered under the existing provisions in the bill. Therefore, we will not be supporting the amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME><STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(11.19 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That speaks for itself. It is further part of the cover-up that the government is already putting in place. It is a pretty simple amendment. It requires that the ministers in their annual report give the reasons for the allocation of money and how much money is being 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3421"> given. That is fundamental to this whole exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not talking about tiddlywinks here; we are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars of public money. We are talking about accountability and we are talking about a responsible information system as far as the public is concerned. Of course, the minister says, `People have got other processes in the morass of government that they can pursue me on if they want to. I will make it as hard for them as possible.' That is the hallmark of a minister who is not being faithful to his task of protecting the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pretty disappointing, to say the least, that the minister is going to obstruct again an effort by this committee to put in place proper accountability. In closing off further response to the matter of forestry alone, it is quite clear that the intent of this minister is to spend money on commercial tree planting operations which are harmful to the environment&mdash;not just small amounts of money, even relatively speaking, as the minister says, but tens of millions of dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He will give no assurance that the money is not going to be spent on native vegetation clearance. In fact, he has made it clear to this committee that he intends to allow money under circumstances which he has in mind to be spent on the destruction of the environment, on environmentally inimical programs, including the loss of vegetation. He says he does not know what the loss of vegetation in this country is, but we know for Queensland alone that it approaches half a million hectares licensed to be lost as recently as 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is a very poor performance by the minister. It is a very loose and fraught set up that we see here. He has just failed in an attempt to reduce the amount of spending that was committed to by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), but we have every reason&mdash;at least the Greens do&mdash;to be very sceptical about this program's outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's record in general is appalling, but when it comes to the specific of spending this amount of public money, I predict now that he is going to be a defaulter. I predict now that much of this money is going to go to people who have connections 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with the government or with those people who are looking after advice to these two ministers as we go down the line for projects which not only are unworthy environmentally or second-rate when there is so much to be done in this country but also are going to be lining the pockets of people who have profit as an outcome, not environmental excellence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the opportunity is being lost. I hope the committee will vote for this pretty clear and fundamental amendment. I note that Senator Harradine is with us again. He has, as I have said before, a record of standing up for government accountability, for transparency and for the need for the public to be informed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is another test as to whether he will stand by those principles, because his vote is pivotal in ensuring that the accountability that is essential for such a big program as this, where the government has denied the Greens' initiative to have an independent and expert committee disbursing the money but left it to these two ministers with their pretty poor record on the environment. I expect that Senator Harradine will see the clear merit in this simple amendment and support it in the interests of good housekeeping and public assurance that the outcomes are going to be in the interests of the legislation's design and in the interests of the environment of this country.</PARA>

What opportunity does the parliament have to pass judgment on the trust? How does the parliament assess the effectiveness of the trust at that time? What does the government plan to do itself?</PARA>

Given that there appears to be no answer from the environment minister on these issues, I think it gives me even greater confidence that the only sensible course of action on the part of the Senate is for us to ensure that there is a sunset clause so we can take the necessary action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill is either unable or unwilling to answer the questions that have been asked of him today in relation to the government's intentions on this matter. I think that ought to

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did give a good deal of consideration to the amendments that the government proposed previously&mdash;the ones that have been dealt with. I look upon this measure not as a budget measure. It really is not a budget measure when you come to think of it. It is a measure that was announced by the government prior to the last election. It really stands or falls upon another measure; that is, the part sale of Telstra. And that did occur. That measure came before the parliament, and the parliament agreed to it on the basis that amounts from that sale would go into the Natural Heritage Trust.

The other factor that I would ask the committee to take into account is that because we do not have the capital contribution from the sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra&mdash;it has not occurred yet and will not for a while, and then there will obviously be considerable accounting thereafter&mdash;we have had to draw on $42 million of public revenue for this year for all of the preparatory work.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the figures we had published, as I said, the expenditure over the next two years will be pretty much just what we had promised it would be. It is just that there will be less in this coming year than the following year because there is still a lot of work being done out there within the community, within the regions, and within state governments, to ensure that we get the maximum ultimate environmental benefit for the public expenditure. It just seems to me to be sensible planning and planning that I would have thought that this chamber would support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Be that as it may, this amendment before the committee really has very little to do with that; this amendment is the opposition's attempt to wind up the trust through repealing this legislation after a period of five years. Goodness only knows what is supposed to happen to the $300 million. I suppose Senator Faulkner's intention is that it should go back into public revenue. I do not know if Senator Brown accepts that; I would have thought he would believe that it ought to be spent on the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It just seems to me to be extraordinary, when all the enlightened advisers say that what you need is a trust in perpetuity&mdash;what you need is a long&hyphen;term program&mdash;for this Senate to decide that it wants to wind it up after five years. I do not know what will happen as a consequence of that; you are talking about new legislation and new attitudes. It may never be re&hyphen;established. I do not know. It is in the hands of this Senate. If it takes as long as this debate, a future government might be reluctant to bring a bill back again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It just seems to me to be crazy, when all the work has been done and the debate has been had here&mdash;literally hundreds and hundreds of hours spent on debating the detail of this legislation in this chamber and out of this chamber, legal advices, state government involvement and the like&mdash;that after five years you simply want to wind it all up. But, if that is the will of the Senate, so be it. The government will obviously be disappointed because we believe in a trust in perpetuity. That was our commitment and that is why we have provided for a starting point of $300 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million at the end of the stated period that we had prescribed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that, apart from Senator Faulkner saying that in some ways this would hold the government accountable, I have not really heard any other argument for this provision. But it does not hold the government accountable; it winds up the trust. It repeals the act and winds up the trust at the end of five years. If that is what the Senate decides, if that is what the Greens and the Democrats and the Labor Party believe, that there should not be a natural heritage trust extending beyond five years, then the parliament is in control of its own destiny.

I think the opposition has been very clearly on the record in relation to that. So let me make that absolutely clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that there is more money in the trust fund, and I understand why. But the government breached its commitment to provide this level of funding over five years; it stretched it out to six years. The government breached its commitment to ensure that this environment funding would be over and above the funding voted in the forward estimates of the previous Labor government. It broke that promise lock, stock and barrel. That has been the achievement of the coalition government in relation to the environment.

This appears to be the only mechanism we have available to us to protect Australia's environment, to ensure that there is reasonable funding for the protection of the environment in this country, to see not all the environment programs that have been hard fought and hard won over a long period of time cut, slashed, changed, rebadged or delayed.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3430"> if his fellow minister on the board, the minister for primary industries, was to spend money in a way which was inimical to the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had the minister fail to say that he will not be allowing money to be spent on native vegetation clearance. He has failed also to give any good explanation as to why four times as much money is to go into restoring native vegetation as is to go into preventing further destruction of Australia's native vegetation cover and damage to its biodiversity, with the loss of wildlife and rare species of flora and fauna which will result from that enormous damage and which is occurring right now in front of our very faces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister leaves this fund open to the potential for money to be spent to enhance that damage rather than to put a stop to it. He is not going to use any leverage whatsoever through the hundreds of millions of dollars of this fund going into projects through state governments, or state government guidance, to ensure that that rapid destruction of native vegetation coverage and loss of our prime forests, including rainforests, is halted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The leverage is there in this legislation to make sure that the state governments put an end to native vegetation clearance before it is necessary to spend $200 million&hyphen;plus in restoring the damage of past vegetation clearance. So, on the one hand, we will have hundreds of millions of dollars out of this fund being spent to repair the damage and loss of native vegetation coverage; on the other hand, this minister's fellow governments&mdash;governments of National or Liberal parties around this country&mdash;will continue to authorise wholesale destruction of native vegetation. What sort of accountability is that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anything that we can do to try to put a check on this, to try to see how it is going, ought to be supported, certainly in terms of public accountability for the huge amount of public funds being expended. Senator Hill says that Telstra is a government instrumentality. Senator Hill, it is a public instrumentality. It does not belong the government; it belongs to the people of Australia. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> semantics give you away. It is necessary for public accountability here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that alone, Minister, we need some ability to review what you or consequent ministers for the environment and primary industry will be doing further down the line. But in terms of the environment itself, of course, the imperative becomes even greater. So I will be supporting the amendment.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments redefine the definition of `agriculture'. The difficulty we have with that definition as it stands in this legislation is that, if you look back at `sustainable agriculture' in an earlier clause, it would allow for fishing operations with a commercial viability outcome to be given funds from the Natural Heritage Trust Fund, and for forestry operations with commercial viability as their prime outcome&mdash;nothing else required&mdash;to be defined as `agricultural operations' which would get money from the Telstra Natural Heritage Trust Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate: this is an environmental fund. It ought to be going to environmental repair. Even more importantly, it ought to be going to preventing environmental damage. It is not about enhancing the profitability of fishing or farming operations; it is about enhancing the environmental outcomes. Very often you can achieve those two things together, but, as this legislation is formulated, these two ministers&mdash;the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy&mdash;would be able to direct money into fishing or logging operations because their economic viability would be enhanced. That is how sloppy the legislation is. That is how loose it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Lees said a while ago, we are left in the position of this minister saying, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3431"> `Trust us.' I won't go through it again, but he has an appalling record on the environment. He cannot be trusted; it cannot be left to him. I am moving these amendments to ensure that we do not have money simply going into fishing and forestry operations for the enhancement of their profitability but to ensure that the money does go to agricultural operations which are environmentally sound and, hopefully, are going to enhance the environment rather than just allow us to tread water, particularly in relation to forestry operations which are not involved in the destruction of native forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that the minister sitting here has licensed the wholesale destruction of native forests in Australia. He has been part of that process. We know that he is part of the move by government to remove restrictions on destruction of native forests of national estate value and even world heritage value in states like Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that he is currently in the business of licensing the destruction of pure rainforests in Tasmania so that they can be woodchipped and sent to Japan to ultimately end up on the rubbish dumps&mdash;and, by the way, to increase the problems of disposal of garbage, because the prices of Australian woodchips are undercutting the recycling programs in Japan. That is creating an environmental problem not only for Tasmania and other states of Australia but also for Japan itself and other countries which are recipients of our forestry operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, the minister has now become part of a process of allowing companies to export whole logs from Australia's forests&mdash;and, very shortly, whole logs from Australia's native forests, without any further licensing requirements. So you export not only the environment amenity here in Australia but also the jobs and the downstream processing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lees, I am afraid I am not one of those folk&mdash;I suspect you are in the same group&mdash;who will trust this minister. We need to tighten up the legislation wherever we can. I recommend to the committee the Greens amendments which are going to tighten up the interpretation of the definition of agriculture 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in clause 44 to ensure that money is not helped to go, through the looseness of that definition, to commercial operations which do not have environmental considerations but which have economic considerations as their primary outcome.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I fully understand and indeed totally respect Senator Brown's motives in moving these two amendments. But I must say at the outset of the comments I am about to make that I need to ask that we vote upon them separately. I think what he is doing with amendment No. 19 is exactly the opposite to what he and I are trying to do. I want to put to him a scenario, and this is from my visit not so long ago to Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we prevent farmers who have large amounts of native forest on their land from having access to this fund because they may, in the future, wish to selectively log a bit of it or perhaps&mdash;as one of the chaps I spoke to in northern Tasmania said&mdash;take about one log per hectare, particularly for furniture, then they will look at the other alternatives that this government has put in place which Senator Brown has just outlined. They could woodchip the whole lot with no second questions&mdash;with no environment impact statements and with no recourse in Tasmania or, as we said already, in Queensland and some parts of New South Wales, even to native vegetation clearance legislation. There are no controls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Suppose you have a farmer who has&mdash;and I have seen several farms in Tasmania&mdash;quite a bit of native forest and the farmer wants to do something with his or her land. The alternative this government has given them so far is, `Woodchip the lot, take the cash and run and then we will help you put in a plantation.' There is a chink in this bill for them to actually get some money to fence that to keep the cattle out, to start some regrowth that, hopefully, will not get chewed back down to the roots if it manages to get its head above the grass anyway, to have a forest that is reasonably biologically intact and to nurture that and not to take the easy way out of trashing the lot which, as I have already said, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3432"> is something that this government is encouraging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is in the bill is not tight enough. This is why the Democrats have tried, through a series of previous amendments, to stop wholesale land clearing, which this government apparently is unconcerned about and which it is certainly not prepared to take the states on about. Obviously the last thing the Democrats want is any more clear&hyphen;felling of native vegetation, whether it is woodland, whether it is forest or whether it is, as I have seen recently on the Errinundra plateau, rainforest. The way this particular amendment is worded&mdash;that is, `commercial exploitation'&mdash;means that that farmer would, I presume, have to sign up to never commercially exploit that area of forest in any way whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to Tasmania&mdash;because it is an area I have visited; I have walked through some of the forests there and looked at the state some of them are in&mdash;generation after generation has gone in and taken timber out here or has flattened it there without even bothering to do some of the basic work that some forestry departments have managed to do in some spots. They are looking seriously at this government's option of clear&hyphen;felling. We have to do everything we can to stop that. I believe one way would be to give them the opportunity to selectively log, to carefully log to maintain biodiversity, but to be able to sell a selection of logs each year, to the furniture market in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honey producers in Tasmania are also concerned about what is happening. They are losing the very trees on which their bees depend. They do not want hectare after hectare of Eucalyptus nitens. To begin with, they all come into flower at the one time of the year, so the bees sit in their hives and live off the honey for the rest of the year. So, in a way, with this amendment we are caught between a rock and a hard place. Both of us are trying to achieve the same thing: both of us are trying to reduce the amount of felling of native forest and, with this amendment in particular, of native forest on private land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, I do not think this amendment will help. We need clear guidelines as part of the agreements under this trust for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> state governments to abide by. The guidelines should start by saying that, if it is a heritage forest, if it is next to or within sight of world heritage forest, it does not get touched; if it includes rainforest or remnant species, it does not get touched. But then the farmer will need money from this trust to make sure that it is fenced, that cattle are kept out, that there are no `accidental' fires. They will need some incentives to protect it. But some of these farmers will have other bits of forest on their land that they will want to exploit&mdash;and I use that word deliberately&mdash;but on the basis of selective logging, carefully managed, with the environment as a very high priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not able to support the amendment in the way it is worded, unfortunately, and nor will I be able to support the government's intentions. Having listened to the debate between Senator Hill and Senator Brown, I have no great confidence that this government understands the urgent situation we have in this country where little is left of many of these forest types.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope, Senator Hill, as we watch this trust in action, that you will get agreements with the states that really mean something and that, in those agreements, there are acknowledgments that farmers will need support to keep those heritage and old&hyphen;growth forests and to keep remnant vegetation in particular&mdash;and there is some in the mallee in South Australia that is virtually the last of its type.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason we have included this definition is, firstly, to be consistent with the income tax act. Agriculture includes both fishing and forest operations. I think it is a sensible legislative practice to try to keep definitions consistent across various pieces of legislation. Secondly, there is the reason we have tried to emphasise during this debate&mdash;which of course is not accepted by Senator Brown&mdash;that sustainable agriculture is vitally important to achieving best environmental outcomes. In `sustainable agriculture' I include sustainable fishing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I actually look forward to us having the environment side of this debate, Senator Brown, and to having a greater opportunity to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3433"> influence sustainable fishing practices. That would be a good outcome for our environment, so why you would want to exclude it I really do not understand. You seem to think in some ways that we will simply be therefore using this public fund as some sort of industry support for the fishing industry as such. That is not the purpose. The purpose is to support sustainable agricultural practices because that leads to a good environmental outcome, and that is what we all should be aiming at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same argument applies in relation to forestry, which was taken up by Senator Lees. It is very important that we at the environmental end of the debate have a greater influence on agricultural practices that include both fishing and forestry. That is the purpose primarily of including it within the definition. I trust that after the debate on this clause we will still have the opportunity to do so.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I reiterate that the looseness of this definition is a matter of concern from an environmental viewpoint, because we are left to fall back on the `trust me' line of the minister. And he cannot be trusted. He says he has sustainable fishing and the environment in mind, but recently he gave the go&hyphen;ahead for fishing in eight areas of the Great Barrier Reef that were hitherto totally protected as part of an experiment to see what the damage will or will not be. When we look at his record, we cannot have faith in his disbursement of funds for what he says is ecologically good management because he does not know what that term means.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard what Senator Lees had to say. I am afraid the problem here is that I have an amendment which says, `Let us not put this money into commercial logging operations in native forests', because that is what will happen as the definition stands. It simply talks about forestry operations&mdash;any sort of forestry operations. There is no exclusion there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lees pointed to a case where somebody might come in and take a tree here and a tree there. If there is to be some measure of restriction on what the minister can interpret as agricultural forestry operations, then it is incumbent upon the Democrats to come forward with that definition.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are concerned about biological viability and biodiversity, the most problematic area and the area of worst threat at the moment in Tasmania is that of woodlands in particular and forests on private land. If you look at the congregations of species which are rare, endangered or facing extinction, both animal species and plant species, you will find that these are on private lands which are in the midlands and elsewhere in Tasmania. This is a matter of enormous concern to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If some restriction was put on spending of money out of this fund for the logging, selective or otherwise, of those private lands, which was going to ensure that environmental enhancement was the outcome, I would be supporting it. But that restriction is not there. If Senator Lees and the Democrats vote against this amendment, they are allowing this minister to determine which areas will be logged and which will not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week we had a very surprising and major criticism of the regional forest agreement process, which is occurring in Tasmania at the moment, by one of the greatest experts in the country on the plight of native species, on biodiversity, on logging and forest operations and, in particular, on the woodlands area of Tasmania, where there are a large number of operators who see money in the trees in the back paddocks which previously were not a commercial operation. With the imminent lifting of restrictions by this minister for the environment and his government, there is going to be very little restriction at all on the clearance of those woodlands for woodchipping and/or for other purposes on the altar of the current logging industry arrangements, which are almost open slather as they stand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lees says that there are exceptional cases where there may be people who are going to carefully, selectively, take trees out of their woods for furniture making purposes. That may be so, but they are the exception, Senator Lees. By not supporting this amendment, you are allowing this minister to make the determination as to what is ecologically good and what is not. I warn you that the outcome is not going to be good.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3434">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I warn you again that the determinant of who gets money from the Natural Heritage Trust Fund in Tasmania, the advisory committee, is not in the department of the environment; it is in the department of the Premier's office and it is headed up by a logger from Forestry Tasmania&mdash;a logger who has a record of opposing vehemently the Wilderness Society, the Conservation Trust in Tasmania and other organisations who have been working to get good environmental outcomes as far as logging in Tasmania is concerned. He is going to be the determinant of the disbursement of these funds in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to make sure that we tighten up the guidelines to prevent wrong environmental outcomes. I do not trust the process and I do not trust this definition of logging operations as part of agricultural operations which are acceptable to this minister to be passing on funds to. You can find the exception, Senator Lees, but there is much more to it than that. There is much more at stake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent survey in Tasmania, which asked property owners whether they would be in the business of protecting what is left of their native forests if offered an opportunity for commercial exploitation, showed that 83 per cent would go in for the commercial exploitation. The other 17 per cent fall into the category you are talking about, Senator Lees, but it is the 83 per cent that I am concerned about.</PARA>

Maybe there is a small percentage who are prepared to keep on doing that, but I believe that, unfortunately, that percentage is reducing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There certainly are some out there who are prepared to set aside their land for wildlife. Many of them have stickers to that effect on their front gates. But some of those who have some of the most important areas are looking at a second option; that is, to clear-fell all or most of it and put in plantations. In Tasmania, hectare after hectare is going under blue gums and nitens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I am saying is that we should give them a third option; that is, some money to conserve&mdash;hopefully with a decent state government program that involves locking some of it away, yes, but allowing other areas to be selectively logged, with the environment as the highest priority. And that will need some money for things like fencing and, hopefully, money towards some proper management advice also. While Senator Brown and I obviously have the same end in mind&mdash;that is, conserving our native forests&mdash;when you are looking at forests on private land, it often unfortunately comes down to economics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's incentives are to clear-fell&mdash;they have removed the restrictions on woodchipping from private land&mdash;or to plant plantations. They are even putting in plantations in forestry areas in Tasmania now&mdash;pseudo&hyphen;plantations, because you are getting some regrowth coming back&mdash;and with the rest of it they are trying to hand plant selected and chosen species.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment Bill before the Senate today brings into effect a measure that was announced in last year's budget. It has the effect of transferring the DIFF loan liabilities from EFIC to the government's national interest account and for the consequent payment to the Commonwealth of a portion&mdash;$40 million&mdash;of EFIC's reserves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill means that the Commonwealth will assume contingent liabilities of some $1.7 billion in respect of the DIFF loans. The removal of DIFF loans from EFIC's account removes the difficulties which EFIC has faced through concentration of exposure on the fairly narrow range of countries assisted through DIFF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition does not oppose the legislation. In itself the legislation is non-controversial. However, I point out that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3436"> DIFF scheme and the potential for loans under it have been far from non-controversial. I remind the Senate of the circumstances we got ourselves into last year when, unilaterally, the government announced the ending of the DIFF scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We remember the embarrassment that was caused to the nation and specifically to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) in his telling the parliament that not one country had complained to him about the abolition of the scheme. It was shown in a very short space of time that it was true that not one had, but that many had. The minister was forced to come into the parliament and indicate he had misled it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was in direct contravention of the code of conduct of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)&mdash;a code of conduct which has been honoured in the breach, not in the application, because this was not the first time that there had been scant regard paid to it. The only circumstance in which people are ever ultimately required to honour it is when they are forced to&mdash;when they are caught out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision of the government and the foreign minister in particular, embarrassing as it was for him, was also a very significant setback for a lot of Australian companies which had come to rely on the DIFF scheme. At the time the minister said that every formal offer for DIFF would be honoured. However, that formal offer only covered seven projects worth some $186 million. In addition to that formal offer, there were 50 other projects worth $1 billion which were effectively scuttled because they had received letters of advice to proceed, but not the technicality of the formal offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The circumstances of this were that this scheme had been in existence over a long period of time. Not only did it have bipartisan support but there was a commitment during the election campaign to maintain it. No doubt it was one of those promises that has hit the fence because it was not a core promise. The government went to the election saying that the DIFF scheme would be retained. Not only is this scheme important for our bilateral relationships but also it has been an important driving force for industry devel 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opment, because it has been through this scheme that our heavy engineering industry has actually positioned itself into export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we think back a decade, at that time heavy engineering in this country did very little by way of exports. The difficulty is that it was very hard to get into export markets, particularly in developing countries where you have to compete against other companies bidding for projects where their governments are prepared to back them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, the backing of those companies comes in the form of either assistance with soft loans through the aid budget or else through a cushioning of the impact, a lessening of the risk. There is risk associated with these things, sovereign risk, but there is also the risk in the sense that there is a fairly long lead time before you get payment for the completion of the product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nature of the DIFF scheme was not just an essential part of our aid program but also a sensible use of aid, the leverage of government money, to assist Australian investment, Australian manufacturers, Australian expertise and Australian services being exported. The heavy engineering sector has seen a huge growth in exports due in no small measure to the fact that many of the companies were able to rely on the DIFF scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were 52 projects in the DIFF pipeline when the foreign minister created this mess. There were 52 projects but they involved something in the order of 600 Australian companies. There is a multiplier effect in terms of the companies that can be brought into the network. That is what we talk about when we say we should use the leverage of government assistance&mdash;assistance which both parties agreed to&mdash;which is important for the countries to which it is directed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why can we not have it both ways? Why can we not at the same time say, `We are prepared to give you that assistance. We are prepared to assist you in your developmental projects. But, provided our own contractors, our own businesses, are up to the mark, then they should be able to use this assistance and get themselves into the marketplace'? They could be the most efficient producers in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3437"> world. They could have the best expertise in the world, but without this assistance they would not be competing on a level playing field. They would have to compete in circumstances where the companies against which they have to bid have the backing of their governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point we are making here is that whilst this technical change in terms of the transfer of the DIFF loan liabilities from EFIC to the government national interest account is taking place we want to take the opportunity to urge the government to rethink its position on this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the Simons report recommends a scheme which bears marked similarity to the outgoing DIFF scheme. That is in itself an indictment of the government's short&hyphen;sightedness on this issue. The government scuttled the DIFF scheme and commissioned a report; the report reports that a scheme like DIFF should be reinstituted. The government has not used the occasion of this budget to do anything about it. As a consequence, a number of Australian companies will miss important market opportunities, particularly in developing nations in Asia. That will not only be money lost to those companies; it will mean jobs are lost in Australia because our aid does not support development in those countries and does not support the opportunity of Australian companies to win positions in those markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, this measure is consequential upon the earlier measure of the cancellation of DIFF. That was a national tragedy. We do not oppose this bill, because to do so would be to badly affect the EFIC operation, but it is consequential on the earlier crime. Now that that crime has been committed, the only thing that can be done is to mop up effectively after it. We support this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Carr has outlined the nature of this bill. I just point out that the proposal regarding the transfer of the responsibility of the University of Canberra to the ACT is something that was agreed to by previous governments and it is a transfer that the Australian Democrats support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that section 50 of the bill actually enables the first principal of the Canberra College of Advanced Education to become the first Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University of Canberra. Obviously, that is redundant, given that they have their second vice&hyphen;chancellor, Professor Don Aitken.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3438">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have actually received a letter, as I am sure many colleagues have, from the vice&hyphen;chancellor, urging that this bill be passed without delay. For that reason, the Democrats are happy to support this legislation. The vice&hyphen;chancellor argues that this bill is important not only for the University of Canberra but also for the community of Canberra and the ACT as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This move will be more than a symbolic recognition of the role of the University of Canberra in the local community. It will allow the university to work more closely with their region. I do not think we can afford to underestimate the importance, especially at this period of time, of universities having the support of&mdash;and working closely with&mdash;their local communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent survey actually shows that the vast majority of Australians believe that universities are vital to our future as a nation. In light of the government's somewhat short&hyphen;sighted and misguided cuts to university operating grants, support from the community, if nothing else, is essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the University of Canberra may be pleased that at long last we are passing this bill, many at the university are not so pleased about other pieces of legislation regarding higher education that have passed this place and have had a profound impact on the University of Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Currently, the University of Canberra has a target student load of 12,750 EFTSU. Had the coalition not made the cuts and downsized, as it has done, this target EFTSU load would have been increased by 140 places this year. So contrary to the claims by the minister that in fact the coalition has increased the target student loads for universities and will continue to increase them each year, a careful look at the target loads, as tabled by the department at estimates, shows that the University of Canberra plans to enrol 45 less students next year&mdash;that is an EFTSU of 12,405. Between 1996 and 1999, the total number of EFTSU that the University of Canberra plans to enrol falls by 500.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the minister's claim that she has increased HECS&hyphen;liable student places refers only to the undergraduate load. What has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been neglected in this debate by the government is the fact that the minister's insistence that universities maintain undergraduate places has not served universities or the students who had planned to undertake postgraduate loads particularly well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the cuts, the minister has forced universities to maintain their undergraduate loads but this has created a chasm in the opportunities available to students. The minister consistently talks about course work places as being MBAs, but that is not actually where the cuts are hurting most. They are hurting students with degrees who need to do postgraduate studies to give some kind of vocational focus to their general studies, for example, to be accredited for professions such as social work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Postgraduate course work places are not expendable. They should not be shifted to the outpost of up-front fee paying places putting them out of the reach of potential students. These postgraduate course work places are not, simply as the minister would have us believe, the second bite of the cherry. They are necessary for students to their first bite of the cherry&mdash;the real cherry being a real job. There is a lack of entry level jobs and we have recognised that our future is in having a clever country. Young people know that if they want a career and they want to contribute to their society then that often entails a commitment upon them to undertake studies of a tertiary nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the commitment they are making to this nation. They are committed to creating a better society, to enter into professions that further our nation socially, economically and intellectually. Yet the Prime Minister says to young people of this nation, `You owe us.' The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has upped the ante by slugging students with vastly increased HECS fees and, of course, more postgraduate up-front fees. So the rhetoric that students and the young people of this country owe us is an insult to those who understand the real meaning of social contract and mutual obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The University of Canberra understands the meaning of social contract and social justice. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3439"> I note that at this stage the University of Canberra has chosen not to implement up&hyphen;front and full cost undergraduate fees and that any university who is listening to the community on this issue would be making the same decision. I congratulate the university on its restraint, on its boldness for not taking up this so&hyphen;called option of up-front full cost fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a brave move supported by the community. It is a move supported by the Australian Democrats. The Australian Democrats will continue to oppose, as we have done, the introduction or entrenchment of user pays education in this country. We congratulate the University of Canberra for their contribution to that fight for a publicly funded higher education system.</PARA></SPEECH>

We have got a government that, for the first time in Australia's history, decides to give an incentive to Australians to save, and all that Labor can do is condemn it.

It is not compulsory. For up to five years before they actually take up the pension entitlement, they could work on in a job that they want to be in.

To not recognise that shows that you do not understand the needs of older people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The longer that older people stay in the work force, the more work they, through spending their money, engender for others. If a single person defers their retirement for five years and qualifies for the maximum rate of pension, they will be entitled to a $21,251 tax&hyphen;free lump sum. A couple in the same situation would be entitled to a tax&hyphen;free lump sum of $35,450. That is a choice for them. Do they want to upgrade their motorcar on their retirement? Do they want to have money for repairing the spouting, if it becomes necessary, on their retirement? These are practical things that older people will value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simplification of payments has also been a key theme in this year's social security budget.

When we get that, we realise that economic growth and jobs that will be created from it will be consistent with conserving our environment and in fact restoring the health of that environment and passing on the environment in a better state to future generations.

But, in fact, it gets in excess of $500 million&mdash;just&mdash;and it will get more than that in succeeding years. As I say, you have to include that $32 million to make any sense of the comparisons.

Can you confirm that Charles Sturt University will have to close its Goulburn campus as a consequence of your decision to abolish 4,700 undergraduate industry places, a decision that hits regional universities the hardest? Are you aware that the New South Wales police royal commission has today recommended support for the tertiary police courses at the Goulburn campus, courses that will now not be able to go ahead because of the closure? How can you possibly claim that the loss of 1,600 industry places in regional New South Wales, 850 places in regional Victoria, 400 places in Western Australia and 150 places in Queensland are, in the words of the Prime Minister, `good for jobs, good for the regions'?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Carr for the question. No, I cannot confirm that and I do not believe Charles Sturt University is in a position to confirm that at this stage either. The abolition of the CIP scheme is a pretty clear recognition from this government that what the federal government was doing was subsidising the training, as you rightly identified, of state public servants. That is a little bit of cost shifting on behalf of the New South Wales government and other governments for the state government related CIP scheme places, obviously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My office has been in touch with CSU and some of the other universities that might be affected by the closure of the CIP scheme&mdash;the orderly closure of the CIP scheme; not the overnight slash and burn which is the sort of thing you would have done&mdash;and has indicated a willingness to discuss with them and assure them that we are willing to sensibly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3451"> discuss a phased withdrawal of it so as to minimise the impact on those institutions that would be particularly affected, of which Charles Sturt University is one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until Charles Sturt have participated in those discussions and seen what we are prepared to discuss with them, I do not think they are in a position to say that they want to close Goulburn either. I do think it is about time state governments footed the bill for the training of their own public servants that they want to go to it. I think that is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to make the point that we have provided other mechanisms by which industry can participate in higher education. That is an aim that we have in common with the previous government; we simply have a different way of pursuing that path. I remind you, Senator, that the previous government, when universities over&hyphen;enrolled, took HECS from those students and put the HECS in the government's back pocket leaving the university to teach the over&hyphen;enrolled students without further money. I remind you that, next year, this government will give back the basic HECS contribution to those universities that over&hyphen;enrol. That is one mechanism. Fee&hyphen;paying places is another mechanism, and there are others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Charles Sturt University, knowing that we are prepared to discuss an orderly and phased withdrawal with them, are indicating that they do not want to discuss that and they simply want to close Goulburn and get out of CIP places, well and good&mdash;we will not have discussions with them.

I think the Aboriginal art collection was going to go to South Australia, various other parts were going to go to Old Parliament House and another section to Yarramundi.

The construction of this was first promised back in 1981&mdash;indeed it was legislated for at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not yet seen Senator Lundy's press release congratulating us on this initiative but, as you would know, the latest shadow arts minister, former Senator McMullan, at least had the grace to say up&hyphen;front that he welcomed that commitment. I know that Senator Lundy is very keen to see the national museum go ahead in Canberra as well. It will be going ahead as a permanent reminder that, unless and until you come clean with the Australian electorate and walk away from the Paul Keating approach to politics, you will never get anywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that this was regarded by the electorate as one of the most fundamental promises of all because all Australians recognise the great cultural sensitivity of a national museum that combines not only the environment but also Australia's social history and the best aspects of our indigenous culture. All of these will be combined on the shores of Acton Peninsular. There is $7 million in the current budget and an indicative planning figure of $133 million. The funds will come 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> out of the to&hyphen;be&hyphen;established Federation Fund&mdash;in other words, it is all there, properly costed and ready to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be an international design competition to be announced shortly which will result in the selection of architects for the project. The $7 million will be used for the selection of the architect, for design work and for documentation so that tenders for construction can be called for early next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will provide a major boost to tourism in the ACT with something of the order of 1,000 jobs over the next few years and, certainly, 200 jobs during the design stage. It is a major step forward, Madam President&mdash;probably the most significant single aspect of the centenary of federation celebrations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Sandy Macdonald for this question. Unlike the opposition, of course, this government is genuinely committed to expanding access to education for young Australians. Students from isolated areas, as Senator Macdonald well knows, are underrepresented in terms of participation rates at tertiary education. There 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fore, this government will double the value of the concession under the Austudy means test where a struggling rural family sends two or more tertiary students away to study for the second and subsequent child. This is on top of our 4,000 equity scholarships announced last year, which are already available to isolated young people to access education. This, of course, means more Austudy for hundreds of isolated and rural families. The benefit will be paid quickly. It will be paid in October and backdated to 1 July this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other measure that will provide real assistance is the discount for partial up-front payment of HECS, removing an obvious inequity in the system inherited from the Labor Party. Until now, under Labor, somebody has had to have the full amount of HECS in order to take advantage of the 25 per cent discount. It is important to recognise that the size of that discount is very large so as to equate to the very substantial benefit people can receive from deferring their payment. So they get a benefit if they defer; they get a benefit from paying up front.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, under Labor the all&hyphen;or&hyphen;nothing aspect of the discount was unfair because it favoured the well off. We hear them chanting over there `helping the rich'. That is exactly what their previous discount on HECS did. The new arrangement will allow those who are less well off to take advantage of the 25 per cent discount. Those who do this will not be the wealthy. The wealthy will pay up front.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was disappointed to see Senator Stott Despoja attacking this measure as being designed to help the rich. Clearly, the really rich are going to pay up front and we are trying to give a discount to people who cannot pay the whole lot up front. She says that it is to help the rich. The potential beneficiaries of this number over 400,000 or more students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja will have the opportunity to put her vote where her mouth is and vote against it if she chooses to do so. No doubt when she has to come and put her vote where her mouth is, she will think twice about it. I hope she will rethink very carefully the manner in which she throws around words 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3454"> like `wealthy' and `rich' when we are talking about paying for education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As much as anyone else, Senator Stott Despoja ought to know that, simply because you went to a wealthy private school, as she did, does not mean that you or your parents are wealthy. It does not mean that, and Senator Stott Despoja knows it. Many parents scrimp and save to give their children extra advantages, and so it will be with the fee paying students next year at Australian universities. However, Senator Stott Despoja, having had the advantage of a parent who was prepared to scrimp and save to put her through a private education and to give her more, will now seek to stop, using any avenue she can, other students having that opportunity at tertiary level. This is a very selfish attitude on behalf of Senator Stott Despoja and the Australian Democrats.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Let me commence my contribution by stating again that we now have more proof that the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, is the weakest Australian Prime Minister since Sir William McMahon. He has managed single&hyphen;handedly to comprehensively sink his own federal budget. Mr Howard has managed single&hyphen;handedly to expose this budget for what it is&mdash;a cash grab for the rich. Mr Howard let the cat out of the bag himself in terms of his own budget. Of course, he has only got himself to blame. He was sunk by six little words in question time in the House of Representatives yesterday&mdash;`I will not be claiming it.' What leadership from Mr Howard!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that the savings scheme is not in the interests of national savings. It is only in the interests of saving Mr Howard at the next election. Mr Howard's so-called battlers will have to battle on while I am afraid Mr Howard's own constituency, the traditional Liberal supporters, will be laughing all the way to the bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am quite sure that Treasury advised Mr Howard against this scheme. I do not really know the view of the Treasurer, Mr Costello. I do know that Mr Costello and Mr Howard had an enormous number of disputes and disagreements through the ERC process. But what we do know is that the John Howard scheme rewards the rich who may or may not bank their tax cheque.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard promised that this would be means tested. It looks like he got rolled by his own party. The rebate got the thumbs up from Mr Costello who said that his tax affairs are private. It got the thumbs up from Mr Black Jack Moore, Mr Katter and Senator Boswell. Those people will have their hands out at tax

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the weak, miserable excuse that Senator Hill came up with in Senate question time today. The best defence that Senator Hill could muster for Mr Howard about this scheme that will cost $3.76 billion over three years is, `Give it a go.' Look at what the reaction has been in the community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may have been an interesting contribution from Senator Patterson, but we are taking note of an answer relating to the effect of the savings initiative rebate in the budget. One of the two central defects of this rebate is it benefits, predominantly, high income earners. We had yesterday the spectacle of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in the House of Representatives having to declare that he was going to give back his $450. We did not hear one word from Senator Patterson about the issue we are debating here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have mentioned, Prime Minister Howard in question time yesterday in the House of Representatives got caught out. It was pointed out to him that, as a high income earner, he gets this $450 a year&mdash;tax free, I might say&mdash;yet a low or middle income earner earning less than $33,000 or $34,000 a year does not get the $450. They might have the potential to get $450, but what low or middle income earner has the potential if they are earning less than $35,000 a year to put $60,000 a year in non-super savings and collect a 15 per cent rebate worth $450? I say again: what low or middle income earner who earns less than $35,000 can put $60,000 into non-superannuation saving to collect a $450 a year tax free rebate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet the Prime Minister can. By virtue of our very generous superannuation fund, he can collect the full rebate of $450 a year. But it gets worse. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) bungled again today in question time in the House of Representatives. When trying to bag Labor's fair initiative to contribute three per cent to workers superannuation the Treasurer asserted that our former cabinet ministers were going to receive this three per cent and a benefit of $1,252 a year. That is what the Treasurer claimed in question time today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it was a real own goal for the Treasurer, because Labor's three per cent contribution to superannuation was means tested; it was not to apply to anyone earning more than $46,000 a year. The Treasurer struck a real own goal; he got it wrong. The Treasurer was wrong when he said that Labor's three per cent would have applied to cabinet ministers, because they clearly earned more than $46,000 a year. Labor said that no&hyphen;one got its three per cent contribution into superannuation if they earned more than $46,000 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the Treasurer has a habit of getting it wrong time and time again. I noticed today that he said that the basic pension is $9,000 a year. It is not; it is a little over $8,300 a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3459"> year. The Treasurer has to start getting his facts right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best example of the Treasurer getting it wrong is this fandangled rebate scheme. It is wrong for two reasons. The fact is that it does apply to high income earners, and that is grossly unfair. If it is supposed to apply to lower and middle income earners, people earning less than average weekly earnings&mdash;$35,000 a year&mdash;the big problem is that they do not have a lot of spare cash. They do not have $60,000 to put into a non&hyphen;super product to get back $450, and they do not have $3,000 in spare cash to put into superannuation to get the $450. In fact, very few lower and middle income earners will benefit substantially from this new rebate system. It is skewed in favour of higher income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other essential problem with this new rebate savings scheme&mdash;aside from the fact that it delivers only half what Labor had committed to do and half of what was in the forward estimates that Mr Costello himself had committed to do&mdash;is that it does very little for private saving. When we asked Senator Kemp today, `Where are the estimates in this document about the increase in private saving that will result from this initiative?', there is none. All Senator Kemp can point to is the increase in private saving from Labor's initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But they did not put the figures in this document for one good reason: there are none. There will be very little if any increase in private saving as a result of this rebate, because it is primarily going to higher income earners and to people who are already saving. It will do very little to encourage additional new saving. The Treasurer has got it wrong. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Labor's attack on the budget savings initiative really is a case of people in glass houses throwing pebbles. It is interesting that today in question time Dr FitzGerald was called, in aid of Labor criticism, `Australia's leading expert on savings'. Of course, Labor had commissioned Dr FitzGerald to prepare a report on national savings in Australia and to recommend how the national savings problem could be addressed. It is interesting 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to look back to his report of June 1993 where he said that `The Commonwealth should seek to return its general government overall deficit to persistent surplus.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did Labor do? Following Dr FirzGerald's report, they ran up $40 billion of deficits in the next three years. So it is really rather ironic that the coalition government will be implementing a positive recommendation of the report on national savings which, in fact, Labor commissioned. No&hyphen;one seems to have mentioned that yet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr FitzGerald was quoted today as saying that Mr Costello could still argue that the overall mix of policies was positive for national savings. Dr FitzGerald was also quoted as saying that voluntary savings were an attractive and necessary part of a national savings regime. So it lies ill in the mouth of those opposite to talk about equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor have opposed the biggest move by a government in recent history to improve the equity of Australia's retirement income system by their opposition to the superannuation surcharge, which of course vastly improves the equity of the super system. The bulk of the savings rebate will flow to people earning less than $40,000 per annum. In contrast, not one of these people needs to pay the super surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has been highly misleading in its comments about the benefits that battlers will get from the rebate. About one&hyphen;third of wage and salary earners earning less than $40,000 make personal super contributions at an average of around $1,300. That is, they already pass the test for getting a $195 rebate. Of course, the coalition government has given them the opportunity to get an even higher rebate if they wish to increase their contributions. Those who are not making personal super contributions certainly have a big incentive to do so. Each dollar they put in will give them back 15c. Also, six million Australians will benefit from the rebate, the vast bulk of whom are low and middle income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is nonsense to suggest that this initiative does not assist the battlers, the low income earners. For a person in the lowest tax bracket, the rebate means that that person pays just 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3460"> five per cent tax on their saving income up to the cap. For a person in the highest tax bracket, the rebate drops their tax rate on savings income up to the cap to 32 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor never once gave an incentive for personal savings. The savings rebate is a good measure, a fair measure and in fact a welcome measure. Not only is it going to assist low income wage earners; it will also assist individuals such as self&hyphen;funded retirees who have previously had absolutely no access to this sort of savings income. Self&hyphen;funded retirees have never before had the opportunity to contribute in such a way and get such a rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's scheme, of course, was limited, in that it applied only to individuals who are currently in the work force. Not only was Labor's scheme limited to those in the work force, but the coalition has ensured that other net income from savings and investments will also be eligible to attract the savings rebate. This will include items such as interest, dividend income, net rental income, net capital gains, privately funded pensions and annuities, assessable bonuses from life insurance companies and friendly societies, partnership income, trust income and attributed foreign income. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak to the motion to take note of the answer to Senator Faulkner's question by Senator Hill about this whole question of the savings regime put in place by this budget. The most interesting aspect of this is that last year's budget was the one for the battlers. The rhetoric was always about the battlers. We heard that this was the new, reformed Liberal Party who really cared about people on low and middle incomes; that they had given up just looking after their rich mates and they had been transformed. So last year's budget was one for the battlers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not hear that rhetoric this year because there is nothing to sustain it. This is the Liberal and National parties back to type, looking after their rich mates, looking after those who already have got it in society to make sure that they get a bit more. It is a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> classic reflection of their attitudes and traditional position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting situation is that the coalition is saying, `If working people save then they, too, can benefit.' But the reality of the savings pattern of working people is that they will not be able to save the sort of money that gives them any real benefit under the scheme. This scheme gives maximum benefit to those who can save $60,000 a year. I am on a very good income and I am lucky to save anything in a year. I do not know how people on $22,000, $30,000 or $40,000 a year are going to be saving the $60,000 that gets them the maximum benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the Prime Minister, John Howard, his ministers, the people earning $130,000 or $140,000 a year, will benefit because they are able to make superannuation payments and they are able to have investment properties and shares. They will be able to claim the full benefit. John Howard does not have the gumption to argue the fairness of this. When put under pressure, what did he say? He said, `I won't claim the benefit myself.' The point is that he cannot argue the fairness of it. He will not stand up and publicly argue the fairness of it, because he knows it is not fair, it is not right and it is not an appropriate measure at this time when so many Australians are doing it tough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony of this is that, if you are a wage earner battling to bring up a couple of kids, you are getting means tested for your family allowance payments, for your child&hyphen;care cash rebate and for sending your kids to university. But, if you are paying rent for the family home, the person to whom you are paying rent can claim that rent as a tax deduction under this scheme and get the $450 rebate. That is whom the government are assisting. They are not prepared to means test this but they will means test your ability to send your children to tertiary education; they will means test your ability to get assistance to put your kids in child care; they will means test your ability to get family assistance to help you bring up your kids&mdash;clothe and feed them and get their medical supplies; but they will not means test their mates who claim $450 a year 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3461"> cash rebate for their investments in shares, rent or superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I challenge anybody on the other side to defend the fairness of that. Liberal members of parliament harangued us over the child&hyphen;care cash rebate, saying that it applied to the rich and why should the rich have their child care subsidised. Why should the rich have their superannuation and rent income subsidised? That is what is occurring under this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard's performance on this matter yesterday really revealed that this whole proposition is indefensible. It is clearly about favouring those who are already doing well and not about protecting those who are doing it tough. John Stone, a former National Party senator, a conservative by any definition, described it in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> as `silly to the point of irresponsibility'. Another critic in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> was the superannuation partner from Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Mr John Randall, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only is the rebate skewed towards higher&hyphen;income earners, but it has been funded from money promised to help lower&hyphen;income earners kick&hyphen;start their retirement savings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the key point. The government has taken the money that the Labor and the Liberal parties promised to put into superannuation for those people who were on average incomes, so that that they could retire in comfort, and redistributed it to the rich. They have taken an average of $100,000 out of people's retirement income by their failure to support the extension of the superannuation surcharge. An extension of the superannuation surcharge would have meant $100,000 extra, on average, for Australian workers retiring.

As Senator Coonan said, the Labor government proposal&mdash;if they were ever going to deliver it&mdash;would simply have benefited those in work. This new measure benefits all Aus 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tralians with savings, right across the board from $1 upwards, and picks up the retirees, for example, not just those in work. It is not a discriminatory scheme at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition are really going to have to decide, when they meet in their party room, what they are going to oppose and what they are not. Are they going to oppose all measures of this government, or are they going to accept that there will be some very good measures introduced by this government? If they are going to be consistent, they will support this government in their savings measure. Even in their time in government, they recognised that national savings needed to be lifted; that it had fallen below historically high levels, around 24 per cent of GDP, to as low as 15 per cent of GDP. Even when the opposition were in government they recognised that we needed a national savings strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are they going to oppose all measures of this budget? If they do, I warn them that the last Labor leader who did that was Mr Brumby in the state of Victoria. He was negative on all aspects of the Kennett government and we recall his fate at the last state election. People do not want you to be negative on all points of a government's budget. You will end up in the same disastrous state as the opposition in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will also have to work out what you are going to oppose in the House of Representatives and what you are going to oppose in the Senate. I refer to the superannuation surcharge. That was accepted by the opposition in the House of Representatives but by the time it got to this house&mdash;Senator Sherry must have flexed some muscle over his leader, Mr Beazley&mdash;it was rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you will have to get a bit of consistency in opposition. First, you have to decide whether you will oppose all matters of the budget&mdash;by the way, if you do, this is the sort of budget we are quite happy to take to the Australian people because it has been well and truly accepted out there. You are going to have to get some consistency between the two houses: what you oppose and what you accept in the House of Representatives and in the Senate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3462">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are going to have to get some consistency in what you oppose and what you are willing to accept in government. The people of Australia are not so stupid as to not recall the fact that in each budget the former Treasurer and Prime Minister Mr Keating did push for a national savings scheme, but now that you are in opposition you oppose it. So do not think politically that you are getting away with these obstructionist attitudes in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not come in here feigning new&hyphen;found support for the battlers. The battlers had their say at the last election, where you were completely wiped out of your own safe seats. Ask Jackie Kelly, the winner of the by-election for Mr Ross Free's seat of Lindsay. But do not come in here feigning support for the battlers, because they know very well that you were never going to deliver your own promises on the l-a-w law tax cuts in 1993. That sort of broken promise straight after the 1993 election really does rank with the now Premier Mr Carr's broken promise on the tolls straight after his election. He said there would be no tolls in New South Wales on the roads and, of course, he broke that promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people never forget those sorts of broken promises. They never forgot your l-a-w law tax cut broken promises, and I dare say they will not forget the broken promise of the Premier of New South Wales. It is a simple scheme. It untangles the probably never to be released Labor l-a-w law tax cuts that were broken and delayed. This delivers savings benefits to all Australians, not just&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to report to the Senate on my recent visits to Singapore and China between 26 March and 2 April.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both visits were part of a deliberate pattern of visits I have made as prime minister to key regional countries in the Asia Pacific region. They follow my visits during 1996 to Indonesia and Japan, and my participation in the APEC leaders meeting in Manila.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The message I conveyed during my visit was that my government was committed to building Australia's engagement in the region. There can be no doubt that Australia's political and economic future is closely bound up with the future of the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our success in our economic partnership with our region will be vital to our economic prospects, and to our capacity to generate worthwhile jobs in Australia, especially for our children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My government is committed to ensuring that Australia's economy is equipped to compete for a share of the spectacular growth in the region, that adequate frameworks are in place at a government level with our regional partners to facilitate business and other links and that Australia plays an active part as a member of the regional community in shaping its future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to extend my deep appreciation to my hosts in both Singapore and China for the warmth and generosity of the hospitality they extended to me and to my party. This was a compliment to Australia, a measure of the regard with which Australia is held in both countries and a recognition 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the great benefits which flow to both sides from our relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President in Singapore, in meetings with President Ong, the prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, and the senior minister, Lee Kuan Yew, I reaffirmed my commitment to Australia's partnership with Singapore.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In an address to a major business lunch hosted jointly by the Singapore Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Singapore Australia Business Council, I outlined the strengths that Australia brings to its economic engagement with the region and the benefits of my government's reform program in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's relationship with Singapore is one of the most diverse and active we have in the region. I marked an important element in the history of that relationship in laying a wreath at the Kranji Commonwealth War Cemetery where 1,100 Australians are buried and the deaths of 1,640 others are commemorated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Singapore is our largest trade and investment partner in ASEAN, with total bilateral trade worth $5.8 billion last year. It is one of the principal sources of visitors to Australia, and the second largest foreign investor in Australia's tourist industry. About 11,000 young Singaporeans studied in Australia last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cooperate very closely with Singapore regionally and internationally. We have very similar views on the importance of APEC. The government is working closely with Singapore to consolidate APEC's role as the pre&hyphen;eminent structure for regional cooperation and to ensure that the momentum of trade and investment liberalisation is maintained within APEC. Singapore's own economic success is a testament to the benefits of liberalisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I expressed my appreciation to the prime minister for Singapore's strong and consistent support for Australia's membership of the Asia Europe Meeting, noting the appropriateness of Australia's participation in this body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have strong defence links with Singapore and Malaysia through the Five Power Defence Arrangements. The Singapore government expressed to me its appreciation for the training facilities that Australia provides for Singapore's armed forces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the breadth and depth of our links it was particularly pleasing to be able to announce with the Singapore prime minister a new aviation agreement which provides for nearly a 40 per cent increase in services between Australia and Singapore, meaning about 30 extra Boeing 747 services between the two countries every week. The agreement will also result in a doubling of the number 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3464"> of air freight services between Australia and Singapore.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President my visit to China had as a principal objective establishing a good working relationship with the Chinese leadership and suggesting new horizons for our economic partnership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I underlined the continuity of Australia's commitment to a strong relationship with China, acknowledging the contributions made by previous governments from both sides of politics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reflecting the strength of the bilateral economic relationship and the priority Australia attaches to it, some of Australia's most senior business leaders participated in my delegation. I would like to thank those business leaders who accompanied me for their contribution to the visit's success. Their participation sent a very positive signal to the Chinese government about the commitment of the government and the business community to work together in strengthening the relationship with China.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given our mutual interests and the importance to the region of cooperation between us, good communication between Australia and China is crucial. I proposed&mdash;and Premier Li Peng agreed&mdash;that we should strengthen dialogue at a political level. We agreed that we would meet regularly at head&hyphen;of&hyphen;government level. I also proposed that the ministerial framework for discussion of economic cooperation be upgraded and broadened in order to ensure our economic complementarities achieved their full potential.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, my government is seeking a partnership in growth with China. I am pleased that we will have the opportunity to continue our discussions on this when the Vice Premier, Zhu Rongji, visits later this month.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">China is already our fifth&hyphen;largest trading partner. In the past decade, Australia's trade with China has grown twice as fast as our trade with the rest of the world. By the year 2000, China could be our third largest trading partner after Japan and the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia will maintain its track record as a reliable supplier of mineral and agricultural commodities. China is already our largest wool market&mdash;taking about one quarter of our wool exports&mdash;and we supply about 60 per cent of its iron ore imports. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I drew the Chinese leadership's attention, however, to the much greater role that Australia could play in fuelling China's economic growth. President Jiang Zemin responded well to this. Australia can play the part in China's economic growth that we played during the rapid industrialisation of Japan and Korea. Possible areas for expansion include LNG and directly reduced iron (DRI). China agreed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> during my visit to send a feasibility study team to Australia to look further at the prospects for DRI.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Investment from China could play an important role in consolidating this economic partnership. I reaffirmed that Chinese investment would be most welcome. According to Chinese figures we are already the second largest destination for Chinese investment after Hong Kong. Australian investment in China is also growing fast.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The composition of the business group that travelled with me reflected the scope for this partnership to expand into new areas, including manufactures, construction and services. In particular, my visit highlighted Australia's strength in financial services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During my visit I participated in a ceremony to mark the issuing to the ANZ Bank of a licence to operate a branch in Beijing. I opened a seminar sponsored by the Australian Stock Exchange in order to explain the benefits for Chinese companies of listing in Australia. Just before I visited, AMP received a licence to open a representative office in Beijing. I supported the applications Colonial Mutual and National Mutual have made for licences to operate in China.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also opened Ansett's new office in Shanghai.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President closer political cooperation between Australia and China is also important.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will, of course, be differences from time to time between us, reflecting our different traditions, cultures and political systems. My government's approach to China will be based on the principles of mutual respect and recognition of our mutual interests. It is better that any differences are discussed openly and directly in a non&hyphen;confrontational way&mdash;in the context of a mutual recognition of the value of our cooperation to each other and the importance of it to the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I reiterated in my discussions that Australia did not regard China as a threat. China's economic growth was to be welcomed, not feared. Rather, we wanted to see China constructively involved in regional institutions and beyond. I underlined our shared interests in APEC. I promoted publicly the benefits for China itself and for the rest of us of early Chinese accession to the World Trade Organisation on reasonable terms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dialogue with China on regional security issues is important. President Jiang Zemin's ready response to my suggestion that our respective defence forces should have regular talks was therefore pleasing. These talks should help provide a clearer understanding of our respective outlooks and promote stability in our region. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3465"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I reaffirmed the Government's commitment to the one&hyphen;China policy. Australia will pursue its legitimate economic interests in Taiwan with due regard to the sensitivities involved.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">China has agreed to regular consular talks and my government has agreed to discuss a possible consular agreement. I raised the case of James Peng, and Li Peng undertook to pass on my concerns to the relevant authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Li Peng assured me that China would respect all the freedoms of Hong Kong after 30 June as laid down in the Basic Law agreed by the UK and Chinese governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since my visit, China has agreed to my proposal for a human rights dialogue. We see such a dialogue as a constructive and potentially productive way of engaging China on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President finally, I want to say something about the importance of the human ties that bind us with the countries of the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Singapore I attended a meeting with Singapore alumni of Australian educational institutions. In Beijing I held a reception for Australian students in China and Chinese students of Australian studies. These were significant and very enjoyable parts of my programme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The store of knowledge of Australia that these links constitute is hugely beneficial to Australia. The understanding of Australia that they generate&mdash;its qualities and values, its economic, intellectual and physical attributes&mdash;is invaluable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Likewise, the communities within Australia who trace their origins to Singapore and China play a significant role in our relationships with these countries. These communities have made an invaluable contribution to Australia. Their success in our country and the esteem in which we hold them are important measures of the sort of society we are and the sort of relationship we want with our neighbours.</PARA>

We have in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  a letter from the President of the Australia Tibet 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Council, P. McGurk. I would like to read that to the Senate. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Heaven forbid that I upset the Chinese Government by criticising its continuing abuses of the people and the land of Tibet, but the report on the six-year prison sentence given to a senior Tibetan monk . . . prompts me to go public&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS>  on 10 May&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">How is it that we Australians can value our freedoms so much, yet let our Government condone these human rights abuses by the Chinese Government of a gentle, peaceful people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the eight years since the military crackdowns in Tibet and Tiananmen Square, human rights groups around the world have reported that abuses by the Chinese Government have increased, yet politicians such as Mr Fischer and Mr Downer would have us believe that things have improved and, by not criticising the Chinese Government, that we can positively influence them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">By turning a blind eye, our Government believes it will be rewarded with trading dollars. Anyone who is critical risks China's financial wrath: the Chinese Government has been making these threats less and less veiled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this is Australia's policy, when will we ever speak up against human rights abuses? It is clear that our Government will do so only when there is little financial risk. We will condemn Burma, but not China or Indonesia&mdash;there's too much money at stake. How could we explain this policy to the more than 700 Tibetan monks and nuns who are in jails in Tibet?</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is an adequate response in itself to this prime ministerial statement. The fact is that the Prime Minister went to Beijing, but he did not adequately raise the issue of Tibet. He has now sidelined that issue into an ongoing dialogue between governments to ensure that the public demand for it here in Australia does not lead him to be embarrassed each time he meets with Chinese leaders to discuss this important issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the fifth ranking Chinese government official is coming to this country a week or so from now. I would draw the government's attention to the need to raise with him the issue of the hundreds of people imprisoned in Tibet, the total clampdown on human rights, the failure of the Chinese authorities to allow people to even wear cultural dress on national days and the continuing apparent house arrest, at least, of the Panchen Lama, who is the world's youngest political prisoner. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3466"> It is an horrific position in Tibet. It is one that we Australians cannot turn a blind eye to and must not allow trade dollars to get in the way of. The government, in particular the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) need to lift their game on this because it is something the Australian people are not going to let go of.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

The committee was established just over a year ago to report to the Senate on uranium mining and milling, especially with reference to environmental protection, health and safety of employees in the industry and affected communities, and the effectiveness of the international safeguards regime, whose purpose is to ensure that uranium designated for civil purposes, especially electricity generation, is not diverted to military purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is indeed essential that Australians understand that in the past two decades uranium has been mined for export strictly on condition that it will be used only for peaceful purposes. At the outset it is essential to stress that the select committee's charter expressly concerned policies and administrative arrangements for ensuring that, if and when uranium is mined, the impact on the environment is minimised and the health and safety of employees in affected communities is properly protected. Our inquiry was not about whether uranium should be mined, either at existing or expanded levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee received more than 100 submissions and we were able to take public evidence at hearings in Canberra, Jabiru, Darwin, Perth, Cotton Creek, Roxby Downs and Adelaide from more than half of those who wrote to us. Both the submissions and the public hearings embraced a full range of community opinion on this important topic, from the mining companies themselves, government agencies responsible for administering mining policy and export of uranium, and a range of environmental, conservation and peace groups.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3467">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The modern era of uranium mining and milling in Australia commenced in the mid&hyphen;1970s, with discovery of uranium deposits in the Kakadu and West Arnhem Land area of the Northern Territory. Some years later the rich Olympic Dam deposit was identified in South Australia, north of Port Augusta.  Mining eventually commenced on the basis of a policy framework which derived from a thorough study of the implications of uranium mining by a commission led by Mr Justice Fox. The Fox inquiry's fundamental finding was that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The hazards of mining and milling uranium, if those activities are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to develop Australian uranium mines.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Our report is above all a confirmation of the continuing validity of that proposition. For two decades it has formed the foundation of a regime of uranium mining and milling which has had only a minimal impact on the environment and which has ensured a strict health and safety regime. Time does not allow me to canvass the full range of evidence which overwhelmingly supports these propositions. The following comment from the Supervising Scientist for the Alligator Rivers Region is indicative:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The co&hyphen;existence of a uranium mine with a major national park for over 16 years, with no adverse impacts on the ecological integrity of the park, has to be considered a notable achievement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">South Australia's Olympic Dam mine is an example of the high level of responsibility which modern mining companies take towards health and safety. Dr Keith Lokan, Director of the Australian Radiation Laboratory, informed the committee that he had:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . considerable respect for the quality of the Olympic Dam operations in the way in which they have managed radiation safety over the years. They are quite dedicated. They take it seriously. It is not something that they go through because they have to. They genuinely believe in it and do it quite well.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The level of accomplishment is high&mdash;very high&mdash;but it is not without blemish. Readers of the committee's report will indeed be able to peruse the detailed list of incidents at 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Nabarlek and Ranger, reported over the years by the Supervising Scientist. Everything is documented, because this was a serious committee systematically examining the whole picture, not just parts which suited our personal predilections. It is only when the whole picture is examined that readers will appreciate just how good is the record. Of Ranger, the Supervising Scientist told the committee of his opinion that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are no lasting environmental impacts as a consequence of the operation of the mine that can be detected away from the mining lease.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Even a critic of the mine told the committee that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ranger . . . is certainly run safer than most mines.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There were 15 reported incidents at Nabarlek over a decade's activity. The Supervising Scientist's view is that none&mdash;I repeat, none&mdash;are expected to have any lasting effect on the environment. The committee believes that this record is a matter of good management rather than luck. Our view is that it is a deliberate consequence of the constructive, purposeful, research based public policy whose development had its genesis in the Fox inquiry and which has been diligently fostered over two decades by such institutions as the Supervising Scientist, the Australian Radiation Laboratory, and, in the international field, by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Australian Safeguards Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also owes a great deal to the responsibility of the mine proprietors, managers and their staffs. They recognised what uranium mining involves for themselves as well as for other Australians. The committee's report stands as the vindication of the Fox philosophy and our recommendations are about endorsing it and modernising it for the next two decades. Current achievement represents the minimum standard which we would expect any new mine which is allowed to open to meet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concern similar to that shown for protection and study of the environment should be given to the impact of mining on affected communities, and this will often mean Aboriginal communities. We support the concept of social impact statements to complement environmental impact studies. We have some proposals to ensure health and safety matters 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3468"> retain their high priority. We want to see Australia maintain its record in the application of, and support for, strict safeguards, both national and international.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Among the overwhelming majority of senators in the committee who have endorsed this report, that is, Liberal, National and Labor, there is only one area of disagreement.  Labor senators, with the support of those in the minority on the overall report, that is, the Green and Democrat senators, have endorsed a larger Commonwealth role manifested in a proposed new Commonwealth Uranium Authority. Its advocates, no doubt, will pursue that in due course. Government senators Alan Ferguson and Sandy Macdonald and I have serious reservations about this proposal, though we readily recognise the good intentions behind it. Our view frankly is that the present arrangement has provided rigorous and robust administration. There is no need for new bureaucratic creations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second finding of the Fox inquiry was that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the hazards involved in the ordinary operations of nuclear power reactors, if those operations are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to mine and sell Australian uranium.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I understand that there is a minority report being tabled by Senators Margetts and Lees. That dissent claims to be based on the evidence presented to the committee. This is deception No. 1. The committee's report provides a comprehensive survey of the evidence. The dissenting report is a model in selective, contentious beat&hyphen;ups of the evidence. Indeed, it is hard to know how Senator Lees could claim to have any real knowledge of the evidence, having missed most phases of the committee's inquiry. She has joined with Senator Margetts in taking this grandstanding opportunity. If Senator Lees and Senator Margetts were, indeed, interested in health and safety matters once uranium leaves Australia, they should have raised it at meetings&mdash;in the event that they were there. I say again, the interest of these two senators is merely a grandstand interest; it is not a genuine interest.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A clear survey of the evidence presented to this committee does not support the minority report which they are tabling. They make much of the incidents at Ranger, but these are all set out in the committee's majority report and there is nothing new in the dissenting report. Significantly, the minority report has ignored the Supervising Scientist's view on these incidents. Again, these are set out in detail in the committee's report where the public can find out all about those; indeed they can find out the full story with regard to uranium mining, not the half of it which is told in the minority report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, the minority report complains about the downgrading of the Supervising Scientist. But it does not show that the office has in fact been downgraded in its analysis. Of course its authors have not been honest because they are complaining about something that happened way back in 1993&mdash;again, an indication of the superficiality in that minority report. It mirrors what we have seen from the critics of uranium exports who try to claim that the tragedy of Chernobyl and the Three Mile Island incident call the findings of this report into question. Let me be quite clear about this: they certainly do not. No lives were lost at Three Mile Island. Chernobyl, in fact, underlines the meaning of the Fox recommendation. It was a run&hyphen;down, neglected reactor&mdash;which demonstrates the importance of strict supervision and proper maintenance of plant, which Chernobyl did not have. It was not a properly maintained reactor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contributions of the uranium mining doubters to this inquiry were decidedly lame. Their information is old and their thinking is stale. They work from preconceived opinion, through emotion, to arrive at prejudice. Their test of information and research is not its rigour but whether or not it harmonises with whatever fits their campaign of the moment. The Australian Conservation Foundation, for example, completely ignored Roxby Downs with regard to health and safety of employees, and their appraisal of Ranger ran out in 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to express my thanks to the committee secretariat for their hard work in the preparation of this report and, indeed, my

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those just listening to Senator Chapman will have a pretty clear idea of just what kind of respect was given to anybody involved in this inquiry who had a different opinion from that of the government, the coalition, and, it appears, the Labor Party&mdash;those who had a different opinion on the environmental aspects, health and safety, Aboriginal community concerns and the ethics of the international sale of uranium which could go into weapons of mass destruction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have as a result of that attitude towards anybody with a differing opinion is a report which I think brings disgrace to the Senate. It does this because of the way people treated it in the process. It does this because of the way members of the committee and members of the community were treated, because of the way the views of scientists were treated and because of the way many, perhaps the majority of, people in Australia who want to see governments taking responsibility for the environment and issues such as nuclear waste were treated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is so sad about this process is that, on most occasions after spending a year in the reporting process, I would be standing and saying what a wonderful support base the secretariat has been in sorting out and treating fairly the people who have come to this process. This has not happened. I invite people to read for themselves&mdash;read whether it is just emotion, read whether it is lies, read whether there is some basis to what has been said by people who happen to have a differing opinion to those who want to make money and profits out of selling weapons of mass destruction, of destroying the lives of the people who work in the industry and the health of those people who live in and around uranium mines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Fox inquiry has been talked about. The Fox inquiry said, `Despite all these concerns, we believe the issues are such that we should go ahead and continue with uranium mining.' There are people from the Fox inquiry who have been forced to work because of different health standards which now would not be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> allowed. We are saying that the standards of the Fox inquiry which were specific to the Alligator Rivers region are okay for today. Well, they are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chair said that it was a serious committee. It was seriously geared towards a specific outcome. The chair said that the committee's role was not to judge whether uranium mining should go ahead. But everything you will read in this disgraceful document will lead you to the impression that uranium mining is safe, that uranium mining is properly controlled, that uranium mining is not likely to have risks of being involved in unethical development of nuclear weapons, and that as a society we can close our eyes to those issues because they are not important, not relevant or not true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at radioactive waste. Five decades have passed since the start of the nuclear age, and no solution has yet been found to nuclear waste. Every country which is involved in the nuclear industry is faced with a growing problem of what to do with it. Let us look at nuclear proliferation. Nuclear energy problems contribute to proliferation because they provide countries with the trained personnel, technical knowledge, equipment and raw materials to develop nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">International safeguards do not work because the International Atomic Energy Agency is underfunded. It has a conflict of interest in that it is also promoting nuclear technology. The safeguards do not cover the nuclear powers adequately, and the facilities can be used for both the weapons and energy cycles. The nuclear proliferation treaty is voluntary. Anyone can leave the NPT after giving three months notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian public has been given to understand by successive governments that Australian uranium can only be used for peaceful purpose. Even the Safeguards Office has admitted that it does not know whether uranium mined in Australia was used in the last French tests. We were given the role of judging environmental performance. This report does not do that. It looks at what exists in terms of legislation, it looks at the processes companies are supposed to go through, and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3470"> then it says, `That equals good environmental performance.' We have not done that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been mentioned, there have been repeated incidents and accidents at Ranger. There has been a massive leak from the tailings dam at Olympic Dam. There has been a cost in properly cleaning up the older mines. We have a situation where the engineering standards for Ranger would not be accepted in any new mine. Even mine sites which may have been reasonably well rehabilitated, such as Nabarlek, will still need  thousands of years of monitoring at public expense, if it happens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will have long-term damage to the delicate ecosystems at Kakadu, Mount Springs and the Rudall River National Park if that should go ahead. Jabiluka is a particular problem. You would think a responsible committee would indicate that there were so many problems that it is considered dangerous to be mined given the available technology. We are pushing to the limits and beyond what is considered to be an acceptable limit&mdash;which is not a safe limit because even health authorities indicate there is no such thing as a safe limit; only a limit over which they say people should not work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal communities have made it clear that the Ranger mine was forced on them. They never wanted it, and their lands were desecrated by it. Their senior traditional owner at Jabiluka has clearly indicated that she does not want a new mine to go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Realising that the government is hell bent on this particular direction, and realising as well that Labor are prepared to go along with this atrocious report, we have however made some recommendations. This would appear to indicate that the next Labor conference will be an interesting one at which to observe what happens to the three&hyphen;mine policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lees and I have made some recommendations that seek to: protect the right of Aboriginal communities to say no to uranium mining; address a wide range of concerns within Aboriginal communities about uranium mining; strengthen the Office of the Supervising Scientist and expand its role to cover all uranium mines; protect the environment; have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> worker dose limits reviewed in the light of the concerns brought to the attention of the committee&mdash;but conveniently forgotten; protect workers from attempts to subvert the Australian dose limits by introducing flexibility and exploring lifetime dose limits&mdash;that is, trying to share the risk amongst even more people; and to protect public health through longitudinal studies of the effects of low dose radiation. We have asked also for the strengthening of Australia's inadequate safeguards regime and for the promotion of sustainable energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have serious doubts, in fact, about the setting up of a Commonwealth uranium authority. However, if it were to be set up properly, it might be something other than a toothless tiger. It is very sad for me to be in this situation of having to say that such a process was, in my opinion, a very sad thing for the Senate to be involved with.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few comments concerning the select committee report on uranium mining and milling in Australia. The report is the product of fairly intensive work by committee and the secretariat alike. The committee visited South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory for inspections of current mines and proposed mine sites. It received extensive and detailed evidence from a range of interested groups. Those groups included labour unions, green and conservation organisations, relevant companies, Commonwealth and state departments and, indeed, many community groups and individuals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party senators&mdash;indeed, most members of the committee&mdash;were acutely aware of the decision of the current government to ditch the three-mine policy of the previous government and, subject to relevant 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3471"> legislation, permit expansion of the uranium mining industry in Australia. Labor Party senators were also aware that this position was broadly in conformity with the policy of the Liberal Party prior to the last election. Labor Party senators&mdash;indeed, I think all committee members&mdash;realised that the terms of reference did not extend to making a decision as to whether the industry should contract or expand. The committee determined at the outset that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report is not about whether uranium should be mined and milled in Australia, either at existing or expanded levels.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That being the case, the committee really had little choice but to take note of the express intent of the government and pursue its deliberations accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is a consistent theme to this report, it is one of concern&mdash;concern about minimising the impact of mining on the environment; concern about ensuring that the health and safety of employees in the industry are protected; concern about the rights of adjacent communities; concern about establishing a mechanism to foster constructive relationships between mining companies and Aboriginal communities; concern about maintaining and enhancing international and Australian safeguards to ensure that Australia's mined uranium is only used for civil purposes in countries which are signatories to the nuclear non&hyphen;proliferation treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concern of itself is, of course, worthless. That is why the committee has recommended a new and enhanced regulatory framework to oversee the uranium industry in Australia. That regulatory structure advocates a three-tier approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, there is the expansion of the Office of the Supervising Scientist as the independent research arm of the Commonwealth in this industry. The OSS has carried out high quality research in the Alligator Rivers area of the Northern Territory over many years. It is highly regarded by both corporate interests and green and conservation groups, as evidenced by the fact that both sides of the debate constantly quoted findings and research of the OSS.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second tier of the committee's approach is the creation of a highly focused, strategically orientated entity to be known as the Commonwealth uranium authority. The CUA would maintain Commonwealth involvement in this critical industry and have coverage of uranium mining and milling in all states and territories. Its primary role would be to grant approvals to mine; to direct environmental impact statements; to supervise plans and programs to ensure that the impact of mines on the environment is minimised; to conduct triennial audits of environmental performance at mines; and to review, audit and evaluate health and safety measures at mines and other locations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is disappointing that government senators did not support this agency. And I suggest strong public interest and concern about all aspects of the uranium industry warrant ongoing Commonwealth regulation of this industry. There is no doubt in my mind that the high standards established and maintained by the ERA in the Northern Territory and also at Narbalek are assisted by the presence of the OSS and the strict regulatory role that the Commonwealth has established in that part of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third and final leg of our approach is a recommendation for the creation of local committees at each mine site in Australia. This particular recommendation is a direct response from local communities, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, for a direct say in matters that impact upon their lives. Whilst uranium mining might bring export dollars, earnings to shareholders and some development opportunities, it cannot be at the expense of local communities. Local communities have a legitimate interest in the environmental issues of uranium mining as they impact on both individuals and the broader physical environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This three-tier approach really establishes new oversight standards. The government in the past 14 months has retained ALP established controls and safeguards. They were acceptable minimums in the last 10 years. New work practices and new technologies are changing the nature of this industry. Public concern still exists about potential hazards.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3472">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report recommends new oversight standards for the uranium industry and is a fine example of proactive public policy receptive to change but ensuring safety. A recurring feature of many submissions was the occupational health and safety of the work force. The committee has listened closely to those submissions and recommends a raft of major changes to guarantee a healthy and safe workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, it is critical that uniform measurement standards for data collection be established in the development of a national radiation dose register. Other recommenda tions go to research for appropriate career dose limits, a uniform method of measuring, calculating and recording dose limits and a full briefing of radiation and radiation hazards for all employees. This should be done regularly and in plain English. In this context, it is worthwhile to highlight a finding of the committee which was critical of the long, drawn out delay in the adoption of the latest international standards concerning radiation exposure. Seven years for development and implementation of standards is much too long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate committee was greatly assisted by the secretariat in its deliberations. It commissioned and received a number of research papers on international safeguards, worker health and safety, and the impact of uranium mining on Aboriginal communities. All papers were of a high quality. They were objective, accurately analysed all evidence and made cogent recommendations which greatly assisted the committee in its deliberations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, the paper by Dr Leigh on worker health and safety and the paper by Ms Irene Wilson from the Defence department were very helpful in guiding the committee in giving form to its recommendations. I wish to thank Mr John Nethercote, the secretary of the committee, for his assistance in planning and organising the work of the committee. He kept committee members up to date with correspondence reports and assisted in the deliberation process. His role was critical in the function of the committee, which addressed a delicate and divisive issue. I also wish to acknowledge the role of government 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> senators&mdash;Senator Chapman, Senator Macdonald and Senator Ferguson&mdash;who indicated a willingness to negotiate around key issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the committee acknowledges that, while the past may have been okay, public interest demands a higher standard in the future. The possible expansion of the uranium industry is of concern to many. That expansion needs strong Commonwealth supervision and the three-tier approach suggested by the ALP to enable the creation of new oversight standards. This is the most critical aspect of the report. I commend it to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with some regret that I stand and speak today. I found the process on this committee the most stressful and the most difficult of any of the committees I have sat on in the last seven years. The process really was the worst that I have encountered, and I hope I never encounter anything like this again. I must, therefore, thank sincerely Mr Frank Nugent for his integrity, cooperation and supportive approach in helping us to go back through the evidence to try to balance the majority report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority report was finally signed off at only 3.15 p.m., so I have not read it. But the first draft, as I read through it, may as well have been written by the mining companies. I congratulate those senators opposite who managed to drag it back to what I saw, which was the draft before the last draft. There had certainly been some improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those government senators who suggest that our position is somehow extreme, I will, in my very brief time, read a couple of our recommendations. It is quite obvious, when you go through the evidence, that there is a negative impact on many Aboriginal people. Our recommendation No. 6 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time of the approval of any new mining operation, or the expansion of any existing mine, Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments should give a clear undertaking that the provision of government services to Aboriginal communities will not be reduced because of the payment of royalty equivalent or similar payments to those communities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One of the areas that really concerned me, when I got that first draft of the majority report, related to the lack of safety precautions for workers. At Olympic Dam we met with some of those young workers, some of whom were only in their twenties and thirties, and, from what I have read of overseas experiences, I have genuine concern for those people in the industry. We have recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As an interim measure Australia should adopt the dose limits accepted in the United Kingdom and refuse to approve new projects where workers might be expected to be exposed on a regular basis to the maximum dose. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3475"> </PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">How is that so extreme? To make sure that workers understand the risks that they are exposed to, in recommendation No. 6 we say:</PARA>

It is a fact that Mr Nugent was put on to work for the secretariat, but he in fact insisted that he would only work for Senator Lees and Senator Margetts. When told that he was not allowed to do that, he resigned from the workings of the secretariat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lees says that the opposition dragged the government towards some of the recommendations. I am pleased to say that, together with Senator Bishop and Senator Margaret Reynolds, government members had very constructive discussions and negotiations as to what should be the outcome of this report. Those constructive discussions could not be held with Senator Lees and Senator Margetts because, on a number of occasions, they walked out of meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lees signed the document, but in fact I do not recall her being present at any of the public visits that were made to either the Ranger or Kintyre mines, and she was absent for many of the hearings. She did, however, go to Roxby Downs. I did not go to Ranger so I have not had any particular input into the

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At all of the hearings that I attended, Senator Lees, it was obvious that you had a particular agenda that you wanted to push. You only took note of the evidence that you wanted to note in your minority report. There is no record anywhere of any contrasting evidence, whereas, in the body of the report that has been put down, the committee has gone to great lengths to put the arguments that were given to us from both sides, and roughly in the order the submissions were given to us. There was very little constructive evidence which was given that would have put us in the position of coming to any other conclusion than the one we came to in the committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to particularly compliment the work of the opposition in what was always going to be a difficult inquiry. It was always going to be difficult. Yet I can say on behalf of coalition senators&mdash;Senator Chapman, Senator Sandy Macdonald and I&mdash;that, together with Senator Reynolds and Senator Bishop, constructive discussions took place to arrive at what I think is a very good report with some very good recommendations. That is the way the committee should work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the comments made by Senator Margetts to the report and to the workings of the committee, I think she will be judged when people read her report against the committee's report.

<PARA STYLE="Para">The motion I have moved and which the Senate is considering this afternoon relates to  the government's announcement in the budget of the so-called savings choice and initiative package. We have expressed three concerns in the motion that I move in the Senate today. The first goes to what we believe will be a lower level of national savings that will result from this particular package. The second is the decrease in Australian workers' final superannuation retirement benefits that will result. The third is the inequity of the so-called rebate proposal which in reality confers greatest advantage on higher income earners and makes it particularly difficult for lower and middle income earners to take advantage of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well to offer choice. Four out of 10 workers in this country, who earn less than $35,000 a year, have a choice, but how many of those workers have a spare $60,000, when you earn less than $35,000, to put into a non-superannuation savings vehicle and receive back this magnificent $450 rebate? Very few workers, I suggest, are in that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I go onto the three issues I have outlined, I reiterate for the Senate that yesterday we had the spectacle of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on the run, recognising the inequities of this $450 tax-free rebate, which he and everyone in this parliament 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would receive as a consequence of what is a very generous superannuation fund that we enjoy. The Prime Minister recognised the inequities of his own scheme and said, `I won't collect it.' If that is true, why didn't he say that in the cabinet room when this rebate system was being constructed? Why didn't he realise that it was fundamentally and in practical outcomes going to advantage higher income earners?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer (Mr Costello) today made it even worse by attempting to throw back at Labor that our alternative, which he promised and committed himself to, of a three per cent government co-contribution would have meant an extra $1,250 a year for what was then our front bench. That was Mr Costello's allegation in question time today. But Mr Costello got it wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer does not understand much about superannuation. He is certainly too arrogant to listen to the broader community about the concepts of superannuation. But Mr Costello got it plain wrong when he claimed that our particular approach would have delivered three per cent, effectively, to higher income earners. Unlike the rebate system announced in the budget, ours was means tested. Our three per cent government contribution into superannuation did not apply to people earning more than $46,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Treasurer was just plain wrong in question time today. He scored a real own goal. In the process of getting his facts wrong and misleading the House of Representatives, deliberately or otherwise, he alleged that our frontbenchers could have received a benefit when they could not have received a benefit. All he did was provide the contrast between our approach and this new government's approach. Our approach was to direct the maximum benefit to lower and middle income earners to provide for their retirement. His approach is to direct the maximum benefit to higher income earners with no means testing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was Labor proposing? Labor proposed a three per cent government contribution. It was not just a Labor proposal. Mr Costello, in a speech just prior to the last election, said that he was accepting that. He was establish 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3477"> ing a bipartisan position on superannuation. During the election campaign, this three per cent contribution commitment was contained in the government's election promises. In last year's budget, Mr Costello put the estimated cost of this three per cent government co-contribution into the forward estimates. Mr Costello can rail all he likes about Labor's approach&mdash;and rail incorrectly and be factually incorrect&mdash;but on no less than three occasions he said that he would adopt that approach, and he has failed to deliver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's approach would have delivered by 2001 a level of contributions equivalent to 15 per cent for all Australian workers earning up to $46,000 a year. That is about, I think, 85 per cent of Australian workers. That was Labor's approach. That would have delivered at age 65, if it was converted into an annuity or a pension, a significantly greater annuity or pension than the current age pension, which  is just over $8,300 a year, for the vast majority of people in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the age pension, the Treasurer got it wrong again when at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>'s function on the review of the budget he claimed that the single age pension was $9,000 a year. He should start getting his facts right in respect of superannuation, drop the arrogant pretence and the blustering that he goes on with in respect of this issue and start listening to a broader range of opinion concerning people who understand these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposal is fundamentally unfair. I will illustrate some of the unfairness. How is a worker earning less than $35,000 going to get $60,000 to be entitled to the $450 rebate? How are they going to get $3,000 in superannuation contributions to receive the $450 rebate? Four out of 10 lower and middle income earners in this country do not save anything at all. That is a bad thing. The outcome of this policy will be a very little increase in savings from these people. They are more concerned about the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day struggles with life. That is why Labor said the government should contribute its fair share of three per cent. On the way through Mr Costello has pocketed half the money. At 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> least part of that money has gone off for this $1 billion centenary fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the priorities of this government? Should this government be delivering a decent, fair and improved retirement incomes policy for this country or should it be delivering $1 billion into a centenary fund or should it be delivering the more substantial benefits of this rebate system to higher income earners and not lower and middle income earners?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one other area I want to deal with and that concerns savings. There is one issue that we can all agree on. Private saving in this country is too low. I am not going to be as politically partisan to say that it is the Liberal government's fault. Because it is not and nor is it the previous Labor government's fault. Private saving in this country has been in steady decline for the last 20 years. Unfortunately, we share that common problem with every other advanced economy in the world, including Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We share another very serious common problem. We have a rapidly ageing population. The budget papers mention this. They highlight the fact that just over one in 10 people in Australia are over the age of 65 at the moment. Within 45 years, one&hyphen;quarter of Australia's population is going to be over the age of 65. Again a common problem around the world is a decreasing work force supporting an increasing ageing population. How do you solve that problem? Do you create some sort of incentive package and on a wish and a hope give it a go as Senator Hill said today&mdash;`Give it a go. Let's see if it works.' We know this sort of incentive package has been tried and has largely failed around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You need a decent level of compulsory&mdash;and people do not like the word `compulsory', but that is what funds the pension system at the moment, a compulsory tax&mdash;saving to fund the pension and retirement income. Effectively, we do that through the current pension system. A proportion of tax revenue funds the minimum pension. But do we want a pension of $8,300 a year? I would argue that most Australians want more. But we are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3478"> going to struggle in the next 40 to 50 years to maintain that $8,300 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the next three years, the extra cost of pensions in the budget will be about $600 million, and it will go up. Labor's vision was to ensure that we have an intersection between a basic pension as well as superannuation income for workers' retirement. The earlier you start to approach the problem, the earlier you will solve the problem. The longer you leave it, the harder it becomes to save sufficiently for retirement incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To briefly digress, Mr Costello has been fond of saying in the last few days, `These are fantastic incentives. This has never been done before.' It has. I will reflect on history very briefly. In 1949, just prior to the Labor government's defeat, the Labor government had established a national pension fund. What did the then Prime Minister, Mr Menzies, do? He scrapped that on coming into office. In its place he substituted an incentive scheme&mdash;a superannuation incentive scheme which said that you were effectively taxed at less than  five per cent if you put money into superannuation. A great incentive. Not much different in its approach from what was in the Treasurer's contribution to savings in the budget. A massive incentive to private saving was introduced by Mr Menzies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened? About four tenths of the population, less than half, took advantage of those massive incentives. Mr Costello rails against these so-called incentives for superannuation when it was Mr Menzies who introduced them. When Labor came into office in 1983 it said, `This is fundamentally unfair. Less than half the work force have superannuation. We have an ageing population.' Labor introduced the current pension&mdash;that is, 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings; $8,300 a year. Labor said, `We have a long-term problem. We have to address this problem. We have to apply some 20&hyphen; or 30&hyphen;year vision to this serious problem.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's approach was that everyone gets superannuation. We increased the tax rate on superannuation to 30c in the dollar, so it is much fairer and more equitable, and introduced the superannuation guarantee of nine 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> per cent. That is our record. We should go the next step. No-one will disagree that you need 15 per cent to provide a decent retirement income. We can disagree with the government about how you get there and the process but no-one will disagree about the level of contributions you need to provide that decent retirement income with an ageing population matched against increasing pressures on the budget to match and support the existing aged pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that these incentives do not work. If we get the equivalent of 15 per cent contributions into saving&mdash;whether it is superannuation or whatever&mdash;as a result of this measure, I will resign my position in the Senate. We know we will not get 15 per cent savings by every Australian as a consequence of this rebate measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go to private saving. The budget statement is fascinating because it does talk about private saving and about the problem, but it then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . gross private saving remains relatively low at around 15 per cent of GDP compared with an average 16 per cent in the 1960s and 18 per cent of GDP in the 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They do not predict there will be any increase in private saving as a result of this initiative. The other budget papers raise a question mark about any increase in private saving at all. It is fascinating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer, amazingly honest for once, acknowledges the increase in saving as a result of our policy&mdash;our superannuation guarantee. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . legislated prescribed schedule of SG contribution rates, are estimated to have a positive impact on national savings of 1.5 per cent of GDP in 2001-2002 rising to 3.6 per cent of GDP in 2019-2020.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Treasurer admits how positive our approach has been in respect of compulsory saving in superannuation. If he accepts the logic of the nine per cent superannuation guarantee increasing private saving, he has to accept the logic that a three per cent government contribution for workers earning up to $46,000 a year, particularly for low and middle income earners, would have delivered 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3479"> an even more positive approach and better outcome on national private saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is saving so important for this country? As I referred to earlier, we face a common problem with every other advanced OECD country&mdash;that is, our saving levels are declining, particularly private saving. That is happening all around the world in every major advanced country. I suspect it is due to more than simply the various economic booms and busts we seem to go through. It is certainly related to economic growth, but I suspect a very deep cultural change has occurred in Australia. I contrast my and my son's attitude to saving with that of my father. My father went through wartime and the Depression. He had an absolute obsession with not going into debt. I suspect that has got a lot to do with the problem that Australia and other Western nations face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's approach was to try to address this problem, and it was succeeding. Saving is important because, if you want economic growth, investment and jobs, you have to have saving. No-one will disagree with that. If you want to buy back the farm, you have to improve Australians' level of saving; otherwise you have to import the capital. If you want to buy back the farm, you have to increase saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On three major counts this approach of the government and Mr Costello fails. It will fail to produce any sort of significant increase in retirement incomes for Australian workers, particularly low and middle income earners. It is inequitable. It will not increase our current low level of private national saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The related issue is, as the Prime Minister has discovered, it favours the wealthy. How many Australian workers can contribute $60,000 to non-superannuation? How many can contribute $3,000 to collect the $450 non-means tested rebate? Labor's approach will be that this particular rebate should not apply to high income earners. It only applies to us as politicians by virtue of our very generous superannuation fund. Is it moral for anyone in this place to accept that $450 rebate in those circumstances?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not often agree with Senator Sherry, but I have to agree with him when he said, `If you want economic growth, you have to improve saving.' It is a bit of the case of do as I say, not do as I do, because the Labor Party when it was in government did not save as a government. How could it ever expect individuals to save if the example it was setting was racking up foreign debt of approximately $10 billion or more a year? Senator Sherry has the gall to come in here and say, `If you want economic growth and if you want to be able to buy back the farm, you have to improve saving.' I think I will remind him of that over and over again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need to save is not only the need for individuals to save but the need for government to save. When Labor was in power&mdash;and I said this earlier this afternoon&mdash;it spent and it spent like there was no tomorrow, and Senator Sherry preached to us about wanting economic growth and to achieve economic growth we have to save! I say to him, `Go back and look at Labor's record, because it was abysmal.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget Mr Costello brought down last Tuesday night gives Australians hope because it shows that this government is about not spending beyond our means, not leaving a debt to for the next generation that it cannot jump over, and doing something about the $180 billion that we owe the rest of the world, on which we pay $10 billion interest a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is $10 billion we do not have to spend on carers programs, $10 billion we do not have to give incentives to people to make contributions to superannuation or to savings, $10 billion we do not have to spend on infrastructure, $10 billion we do not have to spend on hospitals, $10 billion we do not have to spend on all the other things people come into my office asking for because the former Labor government racked up an enormous amount of debt and took us from $23 billion when they first got into power to $180 billion worth of debt. So to come in here and preach to us about saving, I say to them, `Get your own house in order first 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3480"> before you tell us and the Australian community what to do.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this budget is doing is saying to Australians, `We are saving as a government to reduce our debt.' Another demonstration of that is in the partial sale of Telstra where, other than the money going to the natural heritage trust, the money will retire debt. What did the Labor Party do when they were in government? They sold the Commonwealth bank. They sold the first half and promised they would not sell the next half&mdash;and they sold it. They sold Qantas, and where did the money go? It went into a recurrent fund; it was just spent&mdash;no retirement of debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the message the previous Labor government gave to Australians was: `Spend, spend, spend. Don't save, because we don't need to save as a nation. You don't need to save as an individual.' Private debt increased to record levels. Australians privately owed enormous amounts of money, just like the government did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Encouraging people to save is central to the aim of our budget. It is estimated that 6 million will benefit from this scheme, and they will be dismayed, I guess, at Labor's criticism and negativity. But Labor demonstrated that it was out of touch, and the  Australian public responded to that in the last election. We saw an overwhelming number of Liberals elected because Labor had got out of touch and because they do not understand what the Australian people want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party sucked $70 billion out of the national saving pool just in the last five years it was in office. It spent $70 billion more than we were getting in. We have said we will turn this around by responsible policies to boost public and private saving. It is not `Do as I say, not do as I do'; it is `Do as I say and do as I do' because we are demonstrating by our determination to reduce public debt that we are also in the business of saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our measures in this budget, particularly the savings measure, have received widespread support. Before I go any further, let me read a couple of quotes from people. John Maroney from LISA said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">LISA applauded the government's action to improve the retirement income system introducing greater freedom of choice, more realistic preservation requirements and pension take up deferral incentives&mdash;a move advocated by LISA members for the past decade. The integrity of the retirement income system is considerably bolstered by these measures with an added bonus of marked improvement in the national savings position in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mark Patterson from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has also turned the L&hyphen;A&hyphen;W taxed trust&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w promises that the Labor Party was going to give but never gave; the promises kept disappearing out into the distance&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to good use in financing a series of savings measures . . . Greater savings will help finance the growth of investment and will repay this initial seed money many times over in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a very good Budget which will go a long way towards restoring growth and lowering unemployment. Its defining characteristic is stability. It maintains an even keel, while improving saving and building confidence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Richard Gilbert, the Executive Director of the Investment Funds Association, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Budget initiatives for investment and savings are closely aligned to the industry's position. The initiative to introduce across the board incentives for all savings vehicles, including managed investments . . . will receive wholesale support across the community. It is a clear signal that the Government wants all Australians to raise levels of saving and should help to turn around our savings culture.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Terry McCrann said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Peter Costello has decisively buried the Keating legacy in more ways than one with a very good budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It consolidates the nation's finances around a smaller government dynamic&mdash;&hyphen; importantly not a slash and burn and bash the poor smaller government but one that seeks to make government work better delivering the same services more efficiently and cheaply.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Terry McCrann says it has buried the Keating legacy. What was the Keating legacy? The Keating legacy was: a massive $10.3 million debt in that last year, which Australia could not afford; a foreign debt, as I said, of over 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3481"> $180 billion; interest loans that went up to 17&half; per cent; the highest unemployment since the Great Depression, with nearly one million people out of work and reducing living standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figures on living standards show that Australia fell from the 10th position in world rankings in 1983 to the 22nd position, so that when most of us here were leaving school the rest of the world owed us money; by 1983 we were 10th in the world rankings, and by the time Labor left office we had fallen to 22nd in world rankings in terms of living standards. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating budgets produced an increased tax burden on Australians, and we saw the increase in wholesale sales tax and all the sort of tax by stealth that went on Labor. The other thing that happened under Labor was that the rich got richer and the poor got poorer, and we saw 600,000 children under 14 years of age living in poverty. That was the legacy that Labor left us. That was the legacy of Keating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, Labor's record on national saving was absolutely abysmal. National savings in this country fell to the lowest share of GDP that we ever had, excluding the two world wars and the Great Depression. So the only other time that national savings had decreased to the level they were at under Labor was  when our country was in dire straits&mdash;either facing a depression or either of the two world wars. That was the situation we were in under Labor in terms of savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has no credibility whatsoever in the savings debate. They had a plan to boost private savings but at an enormous cost to the public. We said that we were determined to turn around Labor's legacy of deficit, debt and low national saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor said that the key to boosting national saving was to get the budget back into surplus, but they could not do it. They tried and they pretended before the last election that they had. Then, after the election, it all came out. We were not able to get the figures but, as soon as the election was over, the figures came out and there we saw the debt that was left just from that last year. But they went to the election fooling the Australian public that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they had managed to get a budget in balance, which they had not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are proud that we are succeeding where Labor failed. In two years we have managed it; they had 13 years and they could not do it. In broad terms, we are forecasting that the Commonwealth budget will contribute this year about $1.6 billion to the national saving pool in 1998&hyphen;99, compared to the $10.3 billion that the Labor government left us in debt in their last year in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been able to restore public saving and boost national savings. Labor never introduced any reward for people who saved. When Senator Sherry was speaking, he showed a degree of myopia or tunnel vision in this debate. Maybe, because he has been in this chamber on the superannuation debate for days, he can now focus only on those people who are saving for their retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The method that the Labor Party was going to put into place to increase saving left many Australians out of the equation. Who did they leave out of the equation? They left out people who were out of the work force and retired people, who were not going to benefit from their measures. So there was no reward for those people who saved. The whole focus was on saving for retirement. That is absolutely vital and important, but there are also other people who can contribute to saving. They are people who are out of the work force&mdash;and there are some, albeit a small number&mdash;who can manage to save because of some other form of income; and there are older people. As Senator Sherry rightly said, older people have a culture and a tradition of saving&mdash;of not living on the never&hyphen;never plan, of not buying things on hire purchase or on credit cards. They also save but they were not going to benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many Australians who would have got nothing, not a dollar of benefit from Labor's scheme. The plan that they had, the compulsory three per cent cut in disposable income, was going to be a problem for many workers as well. We believe that we have the balance right: higher public and national saving, and an affordable, fair and universal incentive for private saving. Our plan will provide higher national savings.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3482">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The claim that this scheme is discriminatory is not true. As I have indicated before, Labor's plan was totally discriminatory. There were people&mdash;poor, rich or in between&mdash;who could not get access to the scheme at all, whatever their income. They were left out because they were not in the paid work force. There is no limit to claiming this savings rebate: you can claim it on $1 or you can claim it on $100; if you want to put it into superannuation, you can claim it on $3,000 of superannuation contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During their 13 years in government, Labor and their policies were discriminatory. They did not want to give the aged or parents looking after children the opportunity to save or the reward for saving. What the Labor Party was all about in relation to superannuation was not encouraging savings&mdash;that was not their motive. It was about delivering financial power to the trade union movement. All they ever cared about was locking up the funds in industry and occupational superannuation funds. It was discriminatory because, as I said, a large number of people were left out. The Labor Party has opposed retirement savings accounts. They opposed setting them up as an alternative to superannuation, especially for those people who could not access superannuation. They have opposed choice all the way along the line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our approach is totally different. Our government believes in choice, and we are giving people a choice in relation to superannuation. If you want to take the savings rebate on savings in banks, in building societies or in credit unions, you can do it; if you want to take the savings rebate in relation to equities, you can do it that way; and if you want to take the savings rebate in relation to superannuation, you can do that&mdash;it is your choice. This is an opportunity for all people to have choices in relation to savings and it is a breakthrough to encourage savings through the tax system. We have delivered that choice to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Labor Party can sit here and be critical and negative, and say that it is not going to work and that it is going to be detrimental. I have to remind the Australian people again and again that we have a substantial savings 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> problem. Mr FitzGerald, who was commissioned to write a report for the Labor Party when it was in government, outlined that Australia had a major savings problem. As I said, our savings rate has fallen as a proportion of GDP. It was 25 per cent of GDP in the 1960s and early 1970s, and has fallen to around 18&half; per cent since 1983. So we have seen an enormous drop in our savings rate as a proportion of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does that mean? It means that, when our savings drop, we have to rely on the savings of foreigners. We have to rely on borrowing money from overseas to pay for the things that we want. Whether businesses are buying other businesses or individuals are purchasing property, we actually have to go overseas for our savings. That makes us much more dependent on fluctuations in the world market and in world interest rates. We become victims of changes in our currency rate as well, because if our currency rate changes, our interest rates change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In every single way, by increasing our private or public borrowings, we place Australia and our sovereignty at risk. When people walk around here worrying about the republic, for example&mdash;and there are even some on my side who do that&mdash;one of the things that I say to them is that our sovereignty is at risk if we keep borrowing, if we expose ourselves financially. That ought to be our first concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our aim is to encourage and inculcate a concept of saving, both at a public level and a personal level. That is what this measure is all about. Increasing savings will bring important economic benefits for Australia. As I said, it will reduce our reliance on foreign debt and, with more saving, we can finance more of our own investment to bring economic growth and to provide jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The savings rebate will benefit around six million taxpayers and the bulk of the benefit will flow to individuals with a taxable income under $40,000. As for the comments that were made by those on the other side, they are absolute furphies. It will benefit current savers and it will encourage others to start saving. As you move around the traps, how many of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3483"> you have heard people say, `Why would I bother saving? They tax my income and then they tax the income I make on savings.' There is an incredible disincentive to save. So people say, `I may as well spend.' It is one of the issues that we will be proud of, that we will actually reward people for saving. That is an issue. Saving is a vital and important ingredient for Australia, for its growth and to maintain its independence.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to say it in my own words&mdash;$2 billion on what many editorialists have already identified as slush funds. The problem is that, when you take $2 billion out without increasing savings, you cannot claim that your savings measure, your budget centrepiece, is actually going to do what you said is the purpose of it, which is to increase national savings. Yes, we all agree that is a worthy goal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back in 1994, the OECD produced a major study on taxation of savings. It identified a range of criteria to assist nations in developing tightly targeted savings tax incentives. Senator Patterson and others accuse us of not wanting to give people incentives to save. We do not mind incentives. We just want you to get the design right so that you actually achieve the goals that you set for yourself. Having a set of criteria from the OECD, it is really interesting to see that the Peter Costello design, the rebate, fails to follow virtually every one of these criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Costello-Howard saving tax savings plan is not means tested. That is the first flaw. The second flaw is it applies to all savings, not just to new savings. The third flaw is it is not tied to medium-term savings to encourage people to put money away. The fourth flaw is it can be used in conjunction with a whole lot of other tax dodges available to the wealthy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3484">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not all: the more you earn, the bigger the rebate. To get the full rebate, you would need to be putting away about $50 a week into superannuation&mdash;and as we have pointed out, that is 10 per cent of the income of a middle income earner, which is an impossible task&mdash;or you have to have $60,000 already squirreled away in the bank. I know a lot of Australian battlers who have $60,000 who are going to be overjoyed that they can get a $450 rebate for that. The only people who have the savings ability to pick up the full rebate&mdash;whatever choice this government is giving them&mdash;are high income earners. I will just go through some more figures to substantiate this claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Forty-three per cent of low and middle income earning Australians have no savings at all but, suddenly, $60,000 would help them. Sixty-one per cent of low and middle income earners in Australia are not making personal contributions into superannuation. So that means that nearly half of all low income earners will not benefit from this rebate. You may have given them choice, but you have given them no incentive and no benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think you can ignore the impact of last year's budget on these people as well. When we try to look at why they have not been saving, I think it is instructive to remember that last year's budget cost the average Australian household $7 a week in higher charges. By contrast, over 70 per cent of high income earners are paying into superannuation an average of $80 a week, and over 75 per  cent have large savings or share portfolios, an average of $84,000 each.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, these people will all get the full rebate&mdash;$8.60 a week, $450 a year&mdash;but for doing something they are already doing, not for new savings. They will not have to save a single extra cent to pick up this new tax break. So when Senator Patterson and others say that there is no limit to claiming on what kind of savings you will have&mdash;$1, $60,000&mdash;that certainly helps this particular group of already comfortable Australians. It will be just money for jam for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Patterson argued that because this savings plan is universal, it is non&hyphen;discrimina 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tory. But the fact is that over half of the $2 billion tax break will flow to high income earners. So I think it is certainly discriminatory in its impact. Last year's budget took $500 million from high income earners' superannuation tax breaks. This year's budget gives them a billion dollars back. What a rip off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that fundamental question: will it add to national savings, most of us doubt it. It is not just us here engaging in a political debate; those who have done the analysis doubt that it will add very much at all. Why is that the case? High income earners do not need any incentive to do what they have already been doing. They have the capacity and they will simply be rewarded for what they have been doing all along. Mr Vince FitzGerald, the author of the national savings report, predicts that this measure will actually reduce national savings because the tax break&mdash;$2 billion a year&mdash;will be more than any increase in national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I saw what the coalition said they were going to do in their election campaign, and I cannot believe that they would change the design of that so fundamentally. In my view, to proceed with a savings rebate that is not targeted is a very silly thing to do. Tax breaks on savings also have to be means tested. Up until this week, as we know, the coalition had said that their plans involved such means testing. In fact, their particular election policy said that these tax breaks should apply only to those earning incomes below $35,000 a year and should be phased out for those on incomes up to $39,000 a year. I think that cost about $230 million, from memory. It was tightly targeted, not too costly, and it gave incentives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the election campaign we said, `We think this is a very reasonable thing to do and if they want to do this when they are in government they are likely to get our support because, yes, we do need to do something about incentives for savings.' But this billion dollars, this racket&mdash;money for jam for the already wealthy who are already saving&mdash;could have been spent on a lot of other more imaginative and constructive things for Aus 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3485"> tralia in this budget, things called j-o-b-s, jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cancellation of the l-a-w tax cuts&mdash;which we never supported because we thought at the time they were economic vandalism, and we still maintain that view, but the co&hyphen;contribution was slightly more responsible&mdash;gave Treasurer Costello a lot more leeway than he expected to have when framing this budget. I think most people support using $2 billion to retire debt; it is a necessary thing to do. Part of the other $2 billion could certainly have been used for a tightly targeted savings rebate. But some of the other $2 billion should certainly have been used to reduce unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best, the fastest, the surest and the fairest way of increasing national savings is to cut unemployment. It raises national income, it reduces social security spending, it increases tax receipts. Most of all, it provides hope to the 803,200 Australians currently looking for work. I think there is a taxation statistics that needs to be shouted from the rooftops: a fall of one per cent in unemployment can provide a one and a half billion dollar boost to the budget bottom line. But, no, what do we see from this government? We see more and more cutting and we see an absolute waste of money in this badly targeted savings scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A national savings plan without addressing unemployment is only half a national savings plan. A national savings plan that provides a huge and poorly targeted tax break, which actually reduces national savings, is not worth the paper it is written on. How could this  government get it so wrong, given the starting point they had in their election documents?  One can only speculate that this is some kind of cynical massaging of the damage done by the 15 per cent superannuation tax. I think the government has gone about that massaging in entirely the wrong way. Most Australians out there asking, `What does this mean for me?' have already got the message that it means practically nothing at all. It is so disappointing that you made this mistake, and that is why we support the motion moved by Senator Sherry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion moved by Senator Sherry this evening and in doing so support the comments that he made. I am not going to traverse much of the ground that he has already covered in his address this afternoon. In particular, I am going to focus on the practicality of the decision of the government. Before doing so, I just want to state that the access to superannuation which was made available to the vast majority of people in the work force under occupational superannuation and also through the superannuation guarantee was a real boon for them and provided for them a real hope that they would be able to achieve a retirement with some dignity attached to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the significance of superannuation was that it was always going to deliver something better than the age pension. It was never going to deliver the same quality of retirement as senior executives received and it was never designed to. Nonetheless, it was going to give something to people infinitely better and more desirable than the age pension. Of course to do that you had to have a proper base from which people could build their superannuation. While the superannuation guarantee was set at a level of nine per cent, as Senator Sherry said, it was never going to be sufficient. You always have to reach a higher level and that higher level&mdash;regardless of what the government might like to believe&mdash;has to be 15 per cent; otherwise you are going to underfund the retirement benefit of superannuation for people in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course what we have seen from the government in the last couple of days is the wrecking of the hope of people of achieving reasonable superannuation in their retirement. Unfortunately, it has cut out those who need superannuation most; those who are in the low to middle income areas are going to be most affected by this decision because the rebate that has been offered by the government is illusory as those people just do not have the money to save.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3486">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I would like to address some of the more practical issues, particularly the issue of choice, and it is here that I have some real experience because I was a trade union secretary at the time of the introduction of award superannuation. I saw how choice operated in that environment where employers, superannuation funds and the like fought like mad to get the business of those people that they thought were most susceptible&mdash;the workers who had little or no knowledge about how superannuation operated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The particular experience I had was with one firm in Queensland which desperately, and in a paternalistic way, fought to keep its people out of bona fide recognised funds under the award. The firm kept on telling its employees, `Trust us', and shunted them into what ultimately ended up being a substandard fund. This was in spite of there existing, at that time, at least two reputable industry funds which they could have been signed up with. I had the task of challenging that employer and trying to put it to the employees that they were being led down the garden path. Of course, the employer fought tooth and nail to stop those people exercising a right of choice and getting themselves into a legitimate fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I went to put to the employees the simple proposition that the fund that they had been shunted into was substandard, and was going to be detrimental to their long&hyphen;term benefit, I was called every name under the sun. As a matter of fact it was the only time that I have ever threatened anyone with defamation. But, as it turned out, I was prevented from telling those people of the alternative and we ended up in the Industrial Commission. After much bluster, we ended up with a settlement with the company where  they finally agreed to pay new money into a then approved fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the old money was quarantined in an old fund and&mdash;not beyond the realms of possibility&mdash;what do you think happened? The company went broke, the fund went broke and so the savings that people had at that time went down the drain. The organisation that I was associated with, and still am associated with in an honorary capacity, the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> SDA, spent much time, effort and money pursuing that particular employer to recover from that defunct fund the assets that belonged to the employees. Whilst there are prudential activities in place now that will stop that happening, what we ended up with was a very sad and sorry sight of people losing money&mdash;losing their retirement benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course that was principally brought about because, whilst theoretically the people had a choice of funds to go into, that choice was denied to them because of the attitude of the employer. Whilst there are prudential safeguards in place today, I have no doubt that under the proposition that the government has put forward employees will find themselves being put at risk again. Again, whilst their savings will not go completely down the drain, they will be put into substandard superannuation funds which will inhibit their opportunity of having a decent retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if you look specifically at the propositions within this document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Savings: Choice and Incentive</EMPHASIS>, you find that new employees are going to be given the opportunity of a choice from five or more superannuation funds, one of which must be a retirement savings account, which is a low return product; one must be a public offer; and then the others can be other funds. But those funds are to be chosen by the employer, not the employee. So, purely at the discretion of the employer, they are going to be offered five funds and all five of those funds could be absolutely and utterly no good, not acting in the best interests of those people for their retirement benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One might say that that is not going to happen. Of course my experience tells me that the employer is not going to be necessarily sympathetic to the needs of the employee but will be sympathetic to what serves their own best interest and their vested purposes in this whole issue. Hence I believe that is one of the reasons why we have this proposition before us, because we see that there will be spin&hyphen;off benefits for the employer by offering substandard products and the employee having no choice but to pick from a range of bad products to start off with. That is a real possibility.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3487">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another possibility is that of the employer getting it wrong. What happens if the employer picks products to offer their employees that are substandard? Where will the redress be? How will the employees right the wrong that has been done to them? There is no answer to that at this stage. Another practical problem that arises out of the employer having to provide five or more funds from which the employee must choose within 28 days is that administratively this will end up being a nightmare for small business. This government that so much claimed to protect small business has now foisted another burden upon them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the employee side, there are some real problems. Firstly, it will be understanding the propositions that have been put to them. If you have five superannuation packages to choose from, making that choice will not be easy, unless you are informed about superannuation. The average worker&mdash;and that is whom we are talking about&mdash;is not familiar with the superannuation industry and is not necessarily up to speed with what superannuation funds are good and what superannuation funds are not good. They are relying on the goodwill of the employer to give them some assistance in selecting the fund into which their retirement benefit will be placed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other real problem is that some of these employees will be pressured by the employer into accepting the fund which the employer feels most comfortable for them to go into. That has always been the unfortunate reality in the real world where these options and so-called choices are allowed for people. The choice, therefore, may end up being totally illusory and of no benefit to the employee whatsoever. At best, it might be that the person has to choose the worst out of five bad choices made by the employer. That is the situation facing new employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Existing employees will be able to make a choice within two years. The problem for both the new employees and existing employees is how they will be able to make an informed choice. If they cannot make an informed choice, their benefit or saving is possibly going to be placed at risk. The government should sit down and examine the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fact that these people are not in positions of strength. They do not come from a position of power. They do not come from a position of knowledge; they come from a position of weakness. On that score alone, this proposition should not be entertained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be no opportunity in either case that I have just spoken about for those having made a choice, if it turns out to be a bad choice, to choose again. That is not indicated in the document that has been presented to us so far. Once you are locked into a bad product, it seems that you have to stay there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make a few comments on the provision of opting out. This concept in the document undermines totally the strategy of universal superannuation. Invariably it will consign part-time workers who are mainly women to the pension. That, to me, is a retrograde step in our community. I came from an industry which was dominated by part-time women who had gained access to superannuation and who, over a long period of time, would have built up a reasonable benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other problem with opting out is that, on the quiet, it is an extra tax grab. How do I arrive at that? If you look at the bracket within which opting out is allowed&mdash;that is, between $450 per month and $900 per month&mdash;under this proposal by the government people will be able to take out the difference between the award superannuation and the SG.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The example given in the book fixes that figure at this stage at four per cent&mdash;a four per cent difference. If the worker opts to take out that four per cent, which, on the $450 is $18, that money, if it were placed in the superannuation fund, would have been taxed at 15 per cent. However, because they take it as cash in the hand, it will be taxed at the marginal rate. Those people will be paying a higher rate of tax on the money that they have taken out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing about that money is that, in taking it out, it will not be used in savings. The reason that they would be taking it out would be to spend it on consumables; to spend it on their lifestyle. So money that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3488"> would have otherwise been put into superannuation&mdash;into compulsory savings&mdash;would have been diverted to other purposes and would have defeated the very thing that we all seem to agree on: the fact that there is a low level of savings in this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This package of opting out provides no discernible extra means of support for the employee. All it does is reduce their long-term benefit from superannuation, particularly when you consider that the SG will reach nine per cent and they have the chance to opt out up to six per cent&mdash;if three per cent is the award superannuation, which it is in many awards. What they are ultimately missing out on as a contribution to their retirement is double the award superannuation rate, which is a substantial amount of money indeed. So this leaves us in the long term with the problem of people being underfunded in their retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a person takes the option of opting out of the difference in the superannuation from the three per cent to the SG, that person undoubtedly will take the money to live on and they certainly will not save it. The money, in my mind, would be best left in the super fund, working for that person's retirement. But there are other problems and other questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people opt out, who will monitor the compliance of what is happening? Currently, the SG is monitored by the Australian Tax Office; there is a guarantee that the SG is paid. But if people opt out and take the four per cent in cash, where will the proof be? Nowhere in this document is that explained. Also, will people who opt out, particularly the part-timers, lose a range of benefits, which are currently available to people in superannuation funds, because they are not full contributors to the funds? Will they find themselves denied access to death and disablement  insurance? They might find themselves at some time in the future, depending on government policy, without access to low cost mortgages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the part-timers with more than one job? It is wrong to believe that part-timers have only one job; in this day and age, they have more than one. What if they do have more than one job and earn over the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $900 threshold? Those people may well opt out in one or both of the jobs, and yet that defeats the purpose of what the government has put to us in this document here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about in a wage negotiation situation? Who has the upper hand in negotiations as to whether the worker receives occupational superannuation or takes the wage increase? Last but not least, if the worker opts out at, let us say, the four per cent difference, will the opting out four per cent be raised as the SG is raised&mdash;to five per cent, to six per cent? Alternatively, will the worker forgo forever the additional amounts of money? That is, of course, what will happen if they settle by cashing out the four per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that there are many other problems, and I will not pursue them this evening but on other occasions. Tonight in this place I have heard some people quoted as authorities on this initiative of the government, but I think none can be better quoted than Max Walsh in his article today, where he said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hogg has spoken a great deal about choice in superannuation, and the way in which employees will be constrained from making any choices whatever. In answer to the point you raise, Senator Hogg, I would point out that the government has specifically stated that, if it exists, the employer must include the relevant industry fund, and the employer must also include at least one other public fund. It has also stated that employers will not be required to act on an employee's changed nomination of fund within 12 months of acting on a previous nomination; that is, employees will still be able to change funds at least once a year. Indeed, that is what the whole savings initiative is about&mdash;that of choice and that of incentive. You can either choose to save money yourself or you can contribute more to a superannuation fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party, as observed both during their time in government and during their time in opposition, are not exactly the best 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3489"> people to be talking about choice, incentive or, indeed, savings. There are about 70 billion reasons why Labor has no credibility in savings&mdash;and that is the $70 billion worth of deficits they ran up in their last five years in office. Now that they are in opposition, they are trying to stop us from fixing up their problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, what have they done both in the last budget and during the 12 months we have seen them in opposition? They have voted against billions and billions of dollars worth of public saving measures. They have voted against research and development changes, worth $550 million in a full year; they have voted against HECS changes, worth $670 million in a full year; they have voted against migrant waiting period changes, worth $200 million in a full year; and they have effectively voted against the super surcharge, worth $500 million in 1998-99&mdash;and that is just while they are in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did they do when they were in government? They contributed to one of the greatest blow&hyphen;outs in our general debt level ever seen in the history of our country. They were unable to raise public saving, and they were unable to keep the current account deficit under control. Australia's credit rating was twice downgraded under Labor, largely because of very high current account deficits. They left office with the budget in the worst position since at least 1960. As I said, they ran up $70 billion worth of deficits in their last five years. And their policies, as they enunciated them during the 1996 election campaign, would have kept Australia running big deficits right through this term of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My household budget and the household budget of many responsible citizens tells us that you simply cannot keep stacking things up on the bankcard and expecting to emerge at the end of it in a responsible financial position. One way or another, the debt has to be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to 1975, the Commonwealth government consistently ran underlying budget surpluses&mdash;that is, it contributed to national saving. Since 1975, the Commonwealth has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> run an average underlying deficit of around 1&half; per cent of GDP. Commonwealth general government net debt has exploded from around four per cent in June 1990 to around 19 per cent today. The Labor Party is largely responsible for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, Labor has had a record both in opposition and in government of not attacking the deficit and not undertaking responsible measures to try to decrease our debt. In fact, their record on national saving is utterly abysmal. Under them, national savings in this country fell to their lowest share of GDP this century, excluding the two world wars and the Depression. So they have absolutely no credibility in the savings debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They had a plan to boost private saving but at an enormous cost to public saving. Their plan was never going to happen, simply because it is not affordable. I would like one Labor speaker on the other side to stand up and tell me in what year you delivered the l-a-w tax cuts. When was that?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Senator Conroy, under your 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3490"> never delivered l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax scheme, many Australians would have got nothing&mdash;not one dollar of benefits. What did your plan offer the workers? Your plan involved a compulsory three per cent cut in disposable income, something which Australian workers would not accept. We have the balance right. We are attempting to provide higher public and national saving and an affordable, fair and universal incentive for higher private saving.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our plan will provide higher national saving. It will keep the pressure off interest rates, something which is absolutely necessary for an injection of economic power into small business and for the many farmers in this country who are suffering under very high interest rates. It will keep the pressure off taxes, it will encourage higher growth and it will create more jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Private savings are not the problem. Private savings have remained pretty steady over the last three decades. Your government was unable to raise public saving and was unable to tame the current account deficit. You recognised this problem when you commissioned the FitzGerald report. That report stressed the need for the government to balance its books, but you were not up to the task, because you would not implement it. Instead of moving to surpluses and taking the very hard decisions that we have had to take since we came to government, you just kept running up big deficits. Instead of taking the pressure off interest rates, interest rates went up and they achieved very high levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have the answers to fix this problem. Instead of running up big deficits which suck out savings, we will be adding to the national savings pool. Rather than building up a huge debt stockpile, we will cut the debt stockpile by almost half as a share of GDP over the forward estimates. We will make structural gains on the current account. We will keep the pressure off interest rates and, by paying  our way, we will not be letting the debt burden fall on our children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most national leaders always talk about the sort of vision that we hope to pass on to our children and the sort of country we want Australia to be in 10, 20 or 50 years time. The last thing I want for my children is for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them to be under the burden of a national debt which only increased taxes and very high interest rates can go any way towards paying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have we decided to do? We are delivering an incentive for private saving, with the biggest incentive for saving via superannuation. Not only that, we are strengthening our retirement incomes policy, including changes to the preservation arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What would your l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w scheme have offered by comparison? It was not affordable and it involved wrecking public saving in an effort to provide an incentive for private saving. That does not really make sense. Your scheme meant compulsorily cutting three per cent of workers' disposable income. Many workers would simply not have been able to afford that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you thought your l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts were such a great idea, why didn't you deliver them after the 1993 election? You were returned in the 1993 election, much to your surprise, and you then had another three years in which to move towards a much more successful scheme. Why didn't you do it? Perhaps one of your speakers would like to stand up and tell us that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By and large, Labor would never have delivered. We are attempting to do so. Your scheme would not have boosted national savings because it was never going to be delivered and because it was going to cost too much. By the year 2000, it was going to be costing $4 billion a year. The cost would have kept on going up and up. We do not really accept the comparison as being valid. In any event, what is important is the level of national saving. We have the right balance between good levels of public saving and encouraging private saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rebate will help six million Australians and the bulk of the benefits will flow to people earning less than $40,000 a year. It will help people who will not want to put money into super, such as those who are already retired. These people would have got nothing under the Labor Party. The rebate itself will help six million Australians and the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3491"> bulk of the benefit, as I said, will flow to people earning less than $40,000 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to make these longstanding improvements in the budget bottom line, and that means putting away surpluses in the good times. We all hope that with rising commodity prices Australia's agricultural exports will provide more to help reduce the national debt and to provide more income for those in rural and regional Australia. It also means that with a growing economy&mdash;and, faltering though they are, there are some signs of that&mdash;we will be able to put away surpluses in the good times. If we fail to get those surpluses in the good years when the terms of trade are running our way, when we are producing more and more exports and the economy is at last picking up, then the process of ever higher debt will continue. That simply means more debt for our children to repay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding the progress that the government has projected in its budget estimates, government debt as a share of GDP will still be much higher by the end of the century than it was in the mid&hyphen;1970s. As I said, from the figures that I gave dating from 1960, the problem did not arise overnight and nor will it be solved overnight. This is the feature of this government: we take a look at the long&hyphen;term future of Australia and the way in which economic issues have to be resolved. It would be unrealistic to expect that a very high unemployment level will go away overnight. Nevertheless, on that front also we are adopting measures to move it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the mountain of national debt that I mentioned will not go away overnight either, and it will not be solved overnight. So we have to take a long&hyphen;term view. In this our second budget we are looking forward to putting these building blocks in place to build a very strong foundation for the way in which we will move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt some speakers will quote research which shows that tax breaks for private saving  are generally ineffective. We have to start somewhere. If we do not provide incentives for people to save then there will be no incentive for them to save. They will simply spend their money on consumer goods and private saving is not boosted. We hope that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the incentive that we have given will give people something to aim for. For instance, today I was talking to a representative of money markets and they were saying that in their opinion this at least gives people a goal and they know that they will get something back for every dollar that they invest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only that; banks are extremely pleased because, with an incentive for people to save, they can see money flowing into them, and this will boost the amount of capital that is available for the vast infrastructure projects which we need to boost employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many people the rebate will mean that investing a dollar in superannuation will only cost 85c. That is a pretty good deal and we are very pleased about it. For many who choose the other option it will mean a higher return on their bank and other savings accounts. Not only does that provide an incentive to increase saving; it will provide an incentive to redirect those savings into superannuation, which will mean higher retirement incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government would be deluding itself if it thought that this was the sole, or even the primary, answer to our inherited national saving problem. But we see it as one of the key solutions to the problem of restoring public saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do need to make longstanding improvements in our budget bottom line. This means putting away the surpluses at the time that we need to. The main reason we want to boost saving is to boost growth. Until we get that, we cannot get a balanced budget and we cannot get surpluses to see us through the economic downturns which will certainly come. The fact that six million Australians will benefit from this rebate, the vast bulk of whom are low and middle income earners, is something that we take great pride in.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year we had the perverted morality of core promises and non&hyphen;core promises. Behind 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this cloak, the Howard government dodged and weaved its way through its election promises, picking and choosing as it went. `Be relaxed and comfortable', we were told. `Trust me', he said. How can Australians trust the Prime Minister or feel secure or confident about their future if they cannot be confident about their present circumstances? What this country has is a poll driven Prime Minister, a Prime Minister who will not make a move until the polls tell him to move, and tell him which way to move. We cannot afford a Prime Minister like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians were promised certainty, security and, most importantly, leadership. The government has not delivered on any of these. Rather, they have delivered uncertainty, insecurity and indecisiveness: and across the country a mood of quiet anger and frustration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard struggled so hard and so long to be Prime Minister of our country. Now he occupies that office, he is like a rabbit caught in a spotlight: stunned and uncertain which way to turn. This budget just confirms the narrowness of his vision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A budget should, at the very least, be good economics. Labor has always agreed that Australia will benefit from bringing the federal budget into balance. But it has questioned the methods of achieving that goal, and the timetable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have argued that it should be achieved without destroying valuable public programs, without slowing the economy, without destroying services in rural and regional Australia, and without budget tricks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget relies on stealing $3.7 billion from workers' superannuation plans in four years. These super co&hyphen;contributions, which were promised, and which were funded in last year's budget, have now been struck out, and the stolen $3.7 billion used to prop up the bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It relies on an optimistic unemployment forecast so that the bottom line looks better. Worst of all, this budget rips off low income and middle income workers to fund the coalition's extravagances and indulgences. How else can you describe the federation slush fund? People should realise that this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3497"> slush fund is being paid for by their stolen $3.7 billion super co&hyphen;contributions and by increased charges they will be paying at the chemist and for child care. No money for old people's proper medicine but a billion dollars for obelisks, fireworks and centennial champagne. This budget is about the welfare of the Liberal Party and not the welfare of ordinary Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this criterion, the second Howard budget confirms the government's dismal first year record on the key issues of jobs and economic growth. As a result of its first budget last year, which saw the economy slow to a crawl, the government has now been forced to revise down its forecast for growth in the current year to 3&frac14; per cent. With the world economy growing healthily, the strong foundations of the economy they inherited, and the housing cycle recovering, this government can surely do better than the 3&frac34; per cent forecast for next year. Even the Reserve Bank governor thinks that Australia can sustain four per cent growth, without creating inflationary problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without another period of sustained growth around the four per cent mark like that achieved in Labor's last term in office, we cannot reduce unemployment. Under Treasury's economic growth projections, the unemployment rate will still be above 7&half; per cent by the end of this century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government talks about jobs growth and job security, the only solution it can offer is more changes to the industrial relations system. No wonder workers feel uncertain about their futures. It is a dismal economic outlook from a government that has nothing to offer on jobs and growth. Jobs growth has stalled. The latest labour force figures for April show that trend employment growth is dead flat&mdash;exactly 0.0 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the January mid&hyphen;year economic review the government revised up its forecast for unemployment from 8&frac14; per cent to 8&half; per cent, a change the Treasurer described at the time as being mainly due to `rounding'. What a great relief that must be to the 23,000 extra unemployed people! `Oh, we're not unem ployed, we're just rounded!' So much for `rounding': the forecast unemployment rate 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for the June quarter 1997 has now been increased again, to 8&frac34; per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the coalition has been in office, virtually no extra full&hyphen;time jobs have been created. The number of unemployed people has risen by 31,500. Long&hyphen;term unemployment is at its highest level for two years. Even if the stronger growth forecast for next year is achieved, unemployment will be higher than it should and could have been. Claims of better economic prospects next year do not change the fact that the government has caused the economy to grow too slowly and, as a result, thousands of Australians are needlessly unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's dismal record in office does not generate confidence that it can deliver on the slightly stronger growth forecasts in this budget. Jobs growth and job security are the No. 1 issues in Australia. Labor has said this over and over again. Nothing is as important to the economic and social future of the Australian community as generating new jobs. In doing that we can start to make an impact on our unacceptable levels of unemployment and, at the same time, provide people currently in work with some sense of security about their employment futures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the Howard government has been fudging on the jobs issue since it was elected. In the election Mr Howard told us he had a plan to reduce unemployment. Where is that plan? Did it ever exist? Then at the start of this year the government told us to judge their employment record after they had been in office for 12 months. Well, 12 months are up. Fifteen months are up. We can now judge the performance of a government which is not even game enough to set itself a jobs target, and bothers to mention unemployment only once in its budget speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the government's performance you can understand why. In Labor's last year in office total employment grew by 176,000; in the first Howard year, total employment grew by 89,000&mdash;by half that amount. Male full&hyphen;time employment, in our last year in office, grew by 57,000; in Prime Minister Howard's first year in office, it fell by 12,600. And the number of long-term 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3498"> unemployed fell by 45,000 in our last year in office; in Mr Howard's first year in office, it rose by 44,000. That is the record on which he wanted himself judged. I leave it to all Australians to make their own judgments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, the government says that it hopes that the unemployment rate will fall to eight per cent, but can we be confident? Last year the government loudly forecast the unemployment rate would fall to 8.25 per cent, but it is stuck at 8.7 per cent. There are 31,500 more unemployed Australians now than there were when the coalition came to office. The reason? The government in last year's budget axed government jobs, abolished jobs programs, cut skills training, slashed industry programs and deserted regional Australia. So what does it do in this year's budget in response to the rise in unemployment? More of the same. There are nearly 90,000 young unemployed Australians, and there are more than 700,000 older unemployed Australians. We all know that thousands of workers in their 40s and 50s will lose their jobs in Newcastle, while this government sits idly by. The numbers of unemployed will continue to mount up during the next year. Let us be clear about this. As the federal government retreats towards Sydney and Melbourne, most of the job losses are going to be in regional towns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the National Party is lost in action, the federal government is pulling the rug out from centres like Cairns, Townsville, Orange, Ballarat, Bendigo, Whyalla and Launceston. As the Howard government closes its CES, Social Security, Medicare and tax offices, 16,500 more public service jobs will be lost mainly in rural and regional Australia. This follows the 12,600 already gone. And you can add some 4,000 private sector jobs that will go as these offices close. In addition, more than 20,000 jobs are to be lost from Telstra; and the government's defence efficiency review will mean the loss of a further 8,000 defence jobs, many in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what is the government doing about jobs? Virtually nothing. The government has admitted that its work for the dole scheme will do nothing whatsoever to reduce  Australia's high and rising youth unemployment rate. The announcement of the new 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> federation slush fund will do nothing to `generate jobs' quickly. It doesn't even begin until July 1998. Meanwhile, vocational education and training funds have been cut for the second year running. And, sadly, even the number of apprenticeships fell in 1996&hyphen;97, as did the growth rate of traineeships. That is what happens when a Prime Minister and his government just don't care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday at the National Press Club the Treasurer nominated national savings as the government's most important economic objective. The government's decision to scrap the superannuation co&hyphen;contributions policy is a huge blow to national saving. Let us remind ourselves where the $3.7 billion stolen from workers' super plans was going. It was going&mdash;all of it plus as much again in individual workers' contributions&mdash;straight onto the bottom line of private saving. That $3.7 billion has now been pinched to pay for a re&hyphen;election slush fund. There is a savings plan that only the most well off can really benefit from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect on national saving can only be negative. It frightens me to see just how negative. The three plus three per cent co&hyphen;contribution scheme alone would have contributed an extra $400 billion to the national savings pool by the year 2020. The coalition just knocked it off. Let us not be fooled about what is happening when the coalition puts the torch to national savings. They are re&hyphen;distributing national savings as income, and they are re&hyphen;distributing the income. Workers now in their mid&hyphen;30s on average weekly earnings will each lose around $110,000 from the lump sum they would have received on retirement under Labor's plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But where does this money go? I will tell you where the maximum benefit does not go. It does not go to the three million taxpayers who have no interest income to declare. It does not go to the 42 per cent of taxpayers on below average weekly earnings who do not receive any interest. It does not go to 1.3 million full&hyphen;rate age and service pensioners. It does not go to 800,000 unemployed who would be lucky to have anything in the bank.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3499">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So where does it go? It definitely goes to the 463 people declaring incomes over $1 million a year, who earn an average of $52,000 a year in interest. It goes in multiples to members of wealthy families who split their savings income using trusts or other arrangements. It goes to big shareholders like the industry minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you a symbol of how this budget divides Australian society. On the day BHP announced the closure of the Newcastle steelworks, the price of BHP shares went up 50c. If you were a senior BHP manager with share options worth $110,000, your decision to close the steelworks would have made you a $3,000 capital gain overnight. Under the scheme announced in this budget, that $3,000 would also have entitled you to the full $450 savings rebate. But, if you were a steelworker, you lost your job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The vandalising of health care continues in this budget. On health and other social services, the government's intentions over the past two budgets have been absolutely clear. As far as it can, it has walked away from its fundamental responsibility to provide a safety net of service to Australian families&mdash;families that have the right to expect their government to help see them through times of stress and vulnerability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not what the Prime Minister promised in his third so&hyphen;called headland speech to ACOSS in October 1995. In that speech he gave eight ironclad guarantees. Guarantee No. 8 was that `there is no secret plan to slash $10 billion from social welfare'. At last count on Tuesday night, he had only a few hundred thousand dollars to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators will also remember his promise to preserve Medicare. He has hung on to the name and some of its main features, but he has also quietly but effectively undermined it in the meantime. Doctors' payments for home visits have been reduced. Eventually it will be impossible to get a doctor to call at your home, no matter how sick you are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing in the budget for a public hospital system starved by the cumulative effects of funding cuts from Commonwealth and state governments. Hospital waiting times get longer and facilities continue to deterio 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rate. Having taken $500 million out of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in the last budget, the government has cut it by another $700 million this time. This is the budget measure with the cute title of the `therapeutic group premiums'. This is actually the `new drugs tax'. It means that Australians will pay more for the latest, safest and best medication for such conditions as high blood pressure, depression, cholesterol and ulcers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the new drugs tax, the government will only provide a full subsidy for the cheapest drug in each of the six groups of drugs. If patients require one of the more expensive drugs, they will have to pay the difference. So choose your illness carefully, with an eye to market values. For if your doctor prescribes a new drug which has fewer side effects and is more effective, you will pay up to $20 a script more. None of the new drugs tax will count towards the safety net threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This new drugs tax will establish a two&hyphen;tiered health system: one tier for the rich who can afford the newest, safest and most effective drugs; the other for battling Australians who will have to make do with the cheaper, less effective and less safe drugs. It means that pensioners and families who are doing it tough will be forced to choose between what they need and what they can afford.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is more. A number of medications will be removed from the PBS scheme altogether. They include treatments for stomach problems, diarrhoea, muscle pain and anti&hyphen;fungal medicines. Pensioners and other concession card holders now pay $3.20 for these drugs. From next year, they will pay up to $9.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the usual sneaky way of this government, the new drugs tax will not count towards the safety net threshold. Over the last two years, the government has found ways to strip between $300 million and $400 million out of schooling, more than $250 million out of vocational education, nearly $900 million out of the university system and nearly $2 billion out of labour market programs&mdash;many of them provided through TAFE colleges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has gone to enormous lengths to wheedle dollars and cents out of working families by forcing increases in HECs charges, by forcing students to start repaying HECS debts before 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3500"> they are earning a halfway decent wage, and by squeezing the Austudy and Abstudy schemes until they scream.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nearly a third of all the cuts in the last two budgets have been at the expense of help for families on low incomes. Let me give instances of the injury done to women and older family members. Child care is enormously significant for women, for example. It can decide whether or not a woman can go out to work. Yet this government has ripped more than $820 million out of child care in less than a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Older people&mdash;having worked and paid taxes all their lives&mdash;are another group which has been treated savagely by the government. It cut $500 million from aged care services in its first budget alone. It followed this up with one of the most cynical and callous laws ever seen in this parliament: the one that means that older people needing nursing home care, when at their most vulnerable, would have to sell their homes to get that care. So much for being a caring government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Politics might be becoming an increasingly technical discipline nowadays, and increasingly difficult for the majority of voters to identify with. So the government can fiddle with means&hyphen;testing, indexation, cut&hyphen;offs and the like, in the hope that their real agenda can be obscured behind technicalities. They might even succeed from time to time. But I will tell you where they stand naked before the Australian people&mdash;where all the fudges and the statistics cannot protect them. It is when people lose their jobs. It is when the BHP board comes out and says that 2,700 workers are going to lose their jobs when the steel plant closes down in Newcastle. Then you are exposed if you are a government that relies on a simplistic economics textbook to deliver jobs and job security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Australians discover that their elected government is always the one turning up to the funeral of a steel plant with a bunch of wilted flowers, rather than being the plan to save it before it dies, then they have a right to be angry. They have a right to demand a better alternative. Well, they do have an alternative, and if they cast their minds back 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they might remember how that alternative dealt with exactly the same problem in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to BHP's intention to pull out of steel making in Newcastle, the Labor government implemented a steel plan: a plan which everyone, including the Prime Minister, who said he agreed it saved the steel industry in this country and that he would&mdash;and I quote&mdash;`not be stingy about giving credit to Senator Button for what he was able to do in relation to that'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourteen years later, the industry minister is out at a long lunch when BHP announces its intention to pull out of steel making in Newcastle.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Eight months ago the Democrats said the coalition's first budget was built on the backs of the unemployed, and we were right. Eight months down the track, if you were giving the 1997 budget a score out of 10, you would have to rate it minus 46,000, because that is how many Australians by which the government has missed its target on reducing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unemployment. If you asked your average Australian family to rate last year's budget, they would give it a score of minus seven, because that is by how many dollars a week each Australian family was worse off as a result of last year's budget. John Howard tells us every day how much he cares about Australian families and coalition MPs and senators come in here every day and tell us how much they care about Australian families. But the fact is this: the coalition's first budget hurt Australian families and hurt them badly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this year, a highly reputable study found that the 1996 budget left Australian families worse off by $7 a week in disposable income and subsidised services. Sole parent families were worse off by nearly $11 a week. Families whose main income was the disability support pension were worse off by $21 a week. But the figure that really gives the lie to all this professed concern for Australian families is this one: unemployed households were worse off by a massive $38 a week. That is $2,000 a year. That is what the Howard government's first budget did to unemployed Australians: it took $2,000 out of their pockets&mdash;not very fair, not very generous and not very family&hyphen;friendly. But the story does not end there; it does not stop with the coalition's first budget. On Tuesday the Treasurer delivered the second chapter, the second instalment in the ongoing coalition saga of talking big about unemployment while doing practically nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think most Australians are sick and tired of this hypocrisy&mdash;all talk and no action. We talk about how the reputation of politicians has sunk to an all&hyphen;time low and we carry on about what we need to do restore that reputation and to restore respect for parliament and the democratic processes. One way to do it is to start matching all the cant about caring for Australian families, and all the cant about caring about unemployment, with some genuine action because ordinary working Australians are hurting. They are feeling the cold winds of global change right here and now in their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last few months I have been out and about talking to people about unemployment. I have been out in the suburbs of Melbourne 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3502"> and Sydney and Adelaide because I want to know how unemployment is affecting people. I want to ask them what they really think about it, how it is affecting their lives and what they think the solutions might be. But the overwhelming message I am getting from them is that they are feeling incredibly insecure about their own future and about their capacity to provide for their families. People come up to me and say: `Look at BHP&mdash;3,000 Australians who are going to lose their jobs in the next two years.' They say, `Look at the Public Service and Telstra&mdash;30,000 people who have lost their jobs.' They say every day they open up the paper and read of jobs being lost, of people being retrenched and of companies moving offshore. If they are unemployed they tell me they are worried about ever finding a job, and if they have got a job they are worried about keeping it, and they are worried about their kids getting a job. That is the climate out there; that is how people feel out there in the so&hyphen;called real world we are often told to go out and find out about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know many coalition backbenchers are genuinely concerned about the popularity of Pauline Hanson. But it is time they faced the fact: they are part of the problem. When they come in here and defend last year's budget, when they come in here and defend this year's budget, they are colluding in the creation of a climate that is fertile ground for extremists. In their obsession with economics before all else&mdash;an economics that creates benefits for the few and losses for the many&mdash;they are colluding, as did their Labor Party predecessors, in the creation of a climate that is not dissimilar to that which developed in Europe in the inter&hyphen;war years and which led to the rise of fascism. I do not think that is too long a bow to draw. Robert Manne, one of this country's greatest and clearest conservative thinkers, had this to say earlier this week in The Australian:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . inter&hyphen;war fascism was described as the mobilisation of those who felt themselves as the losers in the processes of modernisation. For its part, contemporary right&hyphen;wing populism might be described rather similarly as the mobilisation of those for whom the era of globalisation has offered, thus far, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not prosperity or hope but anxiety, meaninglessness and fear.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Anxiety, meaninglessness and fear&mdash;that is what is out there; that is what people are feeling. And that is what this budget does absolutely nothing to fix.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a start, this budget completely fails the test on jobs. Australians wanted to see the Howard government do something about jobs. A poll in last week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> showed that 67 per cent of Australians felt that reducing unemployment was the most important issue for the budget to address. Only 18 per cent wanted a tax cut instead, so Peter Costello got that choice wrong. That poll simply reinforces the fact that, despite 24 quarters of growth, most Australians do not feel comfortable and relaxed about unemployment. There is certainly nothing in this budget to reassure them. In the 12 pages and 20 minutes or so of Peter Costello's budget speech, unemployed Australians scored only three mentions: once at the beginning to raise our expectations, once at the end to pretend that something had been done, and once in the announcement of the Federation Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That Federation Fund&mdash;John Howard's grand plan to build unspecified projects of national significance, preferably during an election year&mdash;is a total sham and I think the government knows it. For a start, its funding does not kick in for another two years. Even then, the $1 billion is stretched out over five years. How many jobs will it create? Maybe 2,000 a year if we are lucky. That is not now&mdash;that is 2,000 new jobs in two or three years time. I bet that is overwhelmingly good news to the 803,200 Australians who are out of work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the big story in this budget when it comes to infrastructure projects is not the Federation Fund. The big story when you read the fine print in this budget is the massive decline in infrastructure funding planned for this year. This year the Howard government will spend $948 million&mdash;almost a billion dollars&mdash;less on infrastructure than it spent last year. That is a billion dollars less for public works, for roads, for schools, for hospitals, for public housing, for railways and for water supplies. According to the National 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3503"> Institute of Economic Research, $1 billion worth of infrastructure spending has the potential to generate 18,000 jobs across the public and private sectors. So this budget will actually cost 18,000 jobs in infrastructure alone, with maybe 2,000 new jobs to be restored through the Federation Fund&mdash;but not yet, in two or three years time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That sums up the fundamental dishonesty which underpins both this budget and the comments of the Prime Minister about it doing something for jobs. Let me spell it out: this budget does nothing for jobs. This budget costs jobs. Make no mistake about it: this budget's black hole on jobs will hit hardest in the regions. That massive decline in infrastructure spending&mdash;the lowest level of infrastructure spending by a federal government since World War II&mdash;is really going to bite out there in the regions, out there in those areas about which the coalition, particularly the National Party, profess to be so concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are no jobs for regional Australia, regrettably, in this budget. Local government grants&mdash;that is, money for council works and roads&mdash;fall by $200 million over four years. That is a loss of around 1,000 jobs in itself, most of them in country areas. The Public Service loses another 4,300 jobs, on top of the 5,600 jobs lost last year, on top of the 22,000 jobs lost from Telstra plus the 700 announced from the ABC just this evening. That also means a big loss of jobs in regional areas, as does the $200 million cut to public housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of the regional environment employment program and the LEAP program&mdash;two worthy jobs initiatives by the Labor Party&mdash;over the past year saw 25,000 jobs program places go, again mostly in regional Australia. Those places are replaced by a scant 240 places in the green corps this year and 10,000 work for the dole places next year. And they are not jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister tells us that the Natural Heritage Trust Fund is about jobs in regional Australia, but what this budget does is cheat regional Australia by stretching out the trust fund's funding over six years instead of five. That means this year the government will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> spend $36 million less on the environment than it promised in the last election. Fortunately, the majority of the Senate has joined with the Democrats today to reject this funding fiddle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While on the environment, it must not go unremarked that this budget confirms Australia's position as an international pariah on greenhouse gas reduction. Spending on energy research and conservation has once again been slashed&mdash;falling from $42 million last year to a mere $3 million in two years time with the abolition of the Energy Research and Development Corporation. That is $3 million to improve energy efficiency, as against $3 billion in tax breaks and subsidies to the mining industry. Fairly obviously, the pleas of President Clinton, Prime Minister Hashimoto and Chancellor Kohl for Australia to get serious about greenhouse gas issues have fallen on deaf ears.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The failure to invest in alternative and renewable energy sources is yet another example of a missed opportunity to generate jobs through investing in new and growing industries. In the last few days we have seen the Prime Minister dragging out his hoary old chestnut of a solution for unemployment&mdash;that chestnut called getting rid of Laurie Brereton's unfair dismissal laws. But we have already done that. We have already passed his so&hyphen;called `fair go all round' unfair dismissal laws last year. In fact, the Minister for Industrial Relations, Peter Reith, was crowing only last month about how well the new laws are working, with applications to the federal Industrial Relations Commission down 50 per cent on last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But today&mdash;after his budget is roundly criticised for doing nothing about unemployment and almost nothing for small business&mdash;the Prime Minister wants to have another go at denying workers employed by small business the right to challenge an unfair dismissal. That is John Howard's solution to unemployment. Slash infrastructure spending to a 50&hyphen;year low and deny 1.3 million Australian workers employed in small business the basic right to challenge their unfair dismissal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us be clear about this: denying employees in small businesses their basic rights will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3504"> not create one single new job. What every small business person I talk to wants&mdash;and what every poll of small business opinions consistently nominates as the No. 1 condition to employ more staff&mdash;is an improvement in the economy. This budget does nothing to give business and the economy a shot in the arm. Our depressed manufacturing sector&mdash;the big losers in last year's budget&mdash;get nothing out of this budget. Fifty&hyphen;five thousand workers have been retrenched from manufacturing over the past two years, and another 3,000 will lose their jobs when BHP closes its Newcastle plant. An imaginative government, a government firmly focused on getting the economy going again, would have included a shot in the arm for industry in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An in&hyphen;touch government would have responded to the pain and the anger of those workers in Newcastle with an anticipatory economic stimulus package&mdash;not an after the event, hastily cobbled together stimulus package&mdash;with things like an incentive for another steel maker to take over the Newcastle plant and reduce BHP's domestic monopoly; or an infrastructure package to upgrade Williamtown airport as an alternative domestic airport to complement Sydney; or a project to repair 100 years' worth of environmental degradation in the Hunter Valley; or a research and development package to use the University of Newcastle and the skilled labour force of the Hunter as the nucleus of a new high&hyphen;tech industry zone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the sorts of imaginative ideas which we think are needed in response to the problems facing Australia. That is what is needed to get unemployment down. That is what Australians want to see. And that is what is missing from this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Families really are not offered very much in this budget either. The 235,000 families on the public housing waiting lists can expect to wait a lot longer. Forty&hyphen;four thousand people in public housing are left up to $40 a week worse off because of the loss of rental assistance. Let me give you one example of how this particularly nasty little measure will work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A woman rang my office yesterday to tell us that she lives in public housing with her 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> adult son who has a mild intellectual disability. She is on the age pension and her son is receiving unemployment benefits. His income is taken into account in determining the rent&mdash;in fact, 20 percent of his income is taken out for rent&mdash;and he gets a few extra dollars a week in rent assistance. What this woman said was, `Look, it's not a lot of money, but it's just a little bit of extra assistance which helps us get by. We have nothing. We don't own our own home. We don't have a good income and now the government wants to take those few extra dollars a week off us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the sorts of people or the sorts of families that Treasurer Costello is referring to when he refers to this rent assistance payment as `a rort'. That is who is rorting the system&mdash;an aged pensioner and her disabled son. No wonder that male talkback caller said to the Deputy Prime Minister, `This budget's been constructed by those who have never known what it's like to be poor.' If the Treasurer really wants to talk about rorts, then he need look no further than the centrepiece of his budget&mdash;the savings tax rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treasurer Costello tells us that families will benefit from the savings tax rebate, and yes, that is true&mdash;not by very much though. Based on current savings and superannuation patterns, the benefit to a worker on a middle income of around $30,000 will be just $3.60 a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Low income earners cannot afford to put $58 a week into a superannuation fund to get the full benefit of that rebate. They do not have the $60,000 in savings in the bank that is necessary for the full rebate either. In fact, 43 per cent of low and middle income earners have no savings at all; and less than 40 per cent are currently making personal contributions into superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contrast, over 70 per cent of high income earners are paying into superannuation an average of $80 a week, and they have an average of $84,000 in bank savings and shares. These are the people who will all get the full rebate&mdash;$8.60 a week, $450 a year&mdash;not for new savings, but for doing what they are already doing. They will not have to save a single extra cent to pick up this new tax 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3505"> break. For the rich in this country, that is just money for jam&mdash;and it is an awful lot of jam. In fact, over half of this $2 billion tax break is going to flow to high income earners. So much for the government's argument that this rebate is non&hyphen;discriminatory; it is highly discriminatory in its impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We welcome your attempt to give tax relief on savings. But we have always said that any tax break needs to be tightly targeted to encourage new savings. We have always said that any tax break has to be means tested&mdash;and up until this week, what was printed in coalition policy agreed with us. Their election policy said that a tax break on savings should apply to incomes below $35,000 and be phased out on incomes up to $39,000 a year. That sort of targeting would address the concerns of savings experts like Vince Fitzgerald and the warnings from the OECD about the need to ensure that any tax break creates new savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is the sort of targeting that is missing from this budget. I said on budget night that the coalition should stick to its election promise and means test the savings rebate&mdash;and I confirm tonight that the Democrats will move to means test the savings rebate on incomes above $35,000. Not only is that fair, but it would free up $1 billion a year which the government could spend on other measures to increase national savings and national investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats acknowledge that there are some positives in this budget. There are some good initiatives in health&mdash;and we have particularly welcomed the commitments in palliative care and mental health. We have welcomed the long&hyphen;overdue move to set up a national planning system in child care. We are pleased at last to see some assistance for rural families receiving Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have some concerns about the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and to child care&mdash;although I think the government has largely come up with measures which are fair and reasonable in both areas. And I have to say that it is breathtaking hypocrisy on the part of the opposition to be carrying on about these changes, given their own record in government in these two particular areas.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, Australians will probably breathe a sigh of relief that John Howard's political jitters won out over Peter Costello's zealotry, resulting in a lot less slashing and burning than might have been expected. Of course, much of the damage was done in last year's budget&mdash;damage to public hospitals, to state schools, to public dental services, to universities, to labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great disappointment in this budget is that, with $4 billion to spend, John Howard and Peter Costello did not choose to use any of that money to repair some of the damage they did last year. They chose instead to put half of it into retiring debt&mdash;and that is a decision of which we approve. But they chose to put the other half&mdash;the $2 billion worth&mdash;into a faulty savings rebate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. This is not an equitable budget. The fact that it is not recognised as such says more about the collapse of political debate in this nation than it does about this budget. It is a budget totally committed to one form of political 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3506"> economy&mdash;that of the global `free market', where subservience to the needs of vast corporations and currency speculators is accepted as the norm.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This a long way from Adam Smith's `invisible hand' of the market. Ironically, Australia was settled by many of the victims of the free market&mdash;the white settlers, that is. Peasants pushed off the land had to beg for a job in cities. Whole families&mdash;men, women and children over eight&mdash;had to work 12 hours a day to make enough to survive, live 10 to a room and dress in rags. Those less lucky turned to theft and prostitution and faced horrific penalties for crimes such as stealing bread to eat. These penalties included transportation to Australia. Over time, ordinary people, protesting the injustice of the social order, won certain basic rights&mdash;the right to a minimum wage, education, the eight&hyphen;hour day and child labour laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1930s it became patently obvious that the economy by itself could not self&hyphen;regulate against social destruction. In the later part of this century, it is also obvious that the market is not capable of self&hyphen;regulating for ecological sustainability. Progress on social justice and environmental sustainability has been hard won.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parties in government are now attempting to wind that back and return to the blind belief in the free market. They demand business `certainty' but remove regulation from industry. They are busy dismantling those aspects of government that serve an agenda of social development. The promise of a level playing field sounds so fair and equitable. Everyone is in conflict and contest with everyone else. It is dog eat dog and survival of the strongest. That sounds fair, kind of, though not very pleasant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that there is no level playing field, and the more market access is opened internationally, the less fair the market becomes. The strongest can exploit or swallow others and make themselves stronger still. They can simply skew the system so that the competition is between those who are equally strong&mdash;does it sound familiar in relation to media?&mdash;and they build their strength on the exploitation of those weaker than they, like 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> workers. The government then punishes the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget increases the ability of those who already have a lot of power to compete in an unregulated, `equal' fashion with those who have little power. It requires wealth to access many of the `benefits to all' that the government talks about.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="WOODLEY" NAMEID="HX5">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That's right. There are few choices for the jobless and few for the lower paid, unless you call giving up employer superannuation contributions to prop up extremely low wages `choice'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The savings scheme will provide a substantial benefit for those who have the capital to save or invest. It creates options for those who can choose the best vehicle to optimise their investments. It does nothing for those who must spend what they earn on necessities. It will do nothing for those who, instead of saving, invest in their own house, though it will go to those who can invest in rental properties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will allow a deduction for earnings by sole ownership companies and partnerships, which will help those who attempt to get a small business off the ground, if they make enough profit in early years for a tax rebate to help. It will also help doctors, lawyers and any wealthy person who wishes to set up such a structure. It will allow those with stocks to reap the rebate for investment in shares. It will allow those with income from big family trusts the full rebate. It will allow those with a lot of spare money to invest to get the full rebate for income from bonuses from life insurance or from attributed foreign income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a progressive measure. It is regressive precisely because it is a reward for surplus income. It ignores the lack of ability for most people to invest at the level required to get the full rebate. It optimises choice so that every rich person should be able to get full benefit, but the poor are prevented from getting benefit by their poverty. The very reliance on `private choice', on `the market', without acknowledging differences in circumstance and need make this regressive.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3507">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would also, unless the Senate can stop it, allow wealthy families to hold a number of such accounts in the names of various people, each attracting such a subsidy. Of course, the poor are equally free to open accounts of $60,000 for each family member, buy houses to rent out, or have large shareholdings, big family trusts or foreign income in order to maximise their benefits. The market fundamentalists simply refuse to see that freedom does not create capacity, and real choice depends as much on capacity as on freedom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wallis report recommended that bank fees and charges should not be regulated. Perhaps that is for more certainty. Fees will have a major impact on small account holders who make little income, and tax breaks on earnings from interest will be minimal for people who often do not pay tax and whose interest on small passbook accounts that are deep cycled are virtually nil. Deregulation of bank ownership gives no certainty except the certainty of corporate self&hyphen;interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a replacement for the superannuation contribution matching where government would match employee contributions. That scheme was odious in that it used taxpayers' money collected from all to fund retirement incomes on the basis that those who have shall receive more and those that have little will receive little. But the potential benefit of the Keating&hyphen;Willis plan for ordinary workers was worth nearly seven times the benefit of the Costello plan. It would also have applied to all workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a saving of $2 billion gained primarily through cheating the poor. It is a handout to the rich. It replaces a contribution to superannuation matched dollar for dollar with a promise of a 15c in the dollar rebate on superannuation contributions. It is a reduction of benefit of 85 per cent. Under the Keating&hyphen;Willis scheme, a worker contribution to superannuation of $1,000 would have seen government give that worker an additional $1,000. Under the Costello scheme, a worker who can invest $1,000 in superannuation will get a $150 tax rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The full $450 rebate can be obtained by anyone who can afford to put an extra $3,000 per year into superannuation, which is an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> additional contribution of nine per cent or more of their salary. This is the best chance for ordinary workers to get this rebate. This contribution must be made each year to be of benefit, unlike earnings from investment income, which do not need to be increased. Those workers who can afford to reduce their earnings by 10 per cent of pre&hyphen;tax income will get the same benefits as every rich person. And this is supposed to be progressive?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate may have been misled during debate on the retirement savings accounts legislation. A minor but significant part of the favouritism of banks is found on page 145 of budget paper No. 2. This says that the tax office superannuation holding reserve&mdash;which honourable senators will remember I asked quite a few questions about&mdash;which is designed to consolidate and assure charge free administration of small superannuation accounts will be phased out and the money put in retirement savings accounts or given to contributors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no regulation of RSA charges and fees, and they are low return. There is no regime for allowing for the consolidation of small RSA accounts, similar to that of small superannuation accounts. I specifically did ask questions about treatment of the ATO holding reserve on Monday, and was met with reassurances, where I was not met with incomprehension. Perhaps Senator Kemp simply did not understand or, as Assistant Treasurer, was not told about these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has yet another measure to erode the position of the poor. To `improve flexibility' workers will now be able to allow employers to pay extra cash rather than make employer superannuation contributions. Employers will simply offer lower wages and offer to top up incomes by giving up superannuation entitlements. It is the same type of calculation that sees employers offering sub&hyphen;living wages with a promise of enough guaranteed overtime to bring the take&hyphen;home pay to a living wage level. In other words, it is a subsidy to the employers, once again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will offer this to people with no money and no power in a situation where hundreds of other unemployed people compete for the most miserable jobs. It does 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3508"> so with the government threat of the `work for your poverty' dole scheme behind it. It will offer this to people knowing that in most jobs their security and rights have been eroded by the government's industrial relations bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another element of inequity disguised as choice is the deferred pension plan, which is likely to be of benefit to executives, academics and upper income headworkers rather than to older labourers, lower to middle level white&hyphen;collar workers or technical specialists such as engineers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Unemployment falls unevenly on the old, but there are patterns of distribution by job type. Most commonly, those made redundant after 50 find it extremely difficult to get employment. These people are further penalised by changes announced in the last budget which demand that they use their superannuation assets before receiving the pension. They are therefore penalised for being old and unemployed while those in positions where they have the option to keep working will be rewarded. Where is the justice here? This is also a savings measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Guaranteeing pensions at a quarter of average weekly earnings, or AWE, has to be seen in context. One&hyphen;quarter of the current average weekly ordinary full&hyphen;time adult wage for the March quarter is $173.75 and the current single pension rate is $173.20. The pension has been kept roughly equal to 25 per cent of the average weekly earnings for some time. The pension rate is currently set according to the average wage, although not in legislation. So this is really not so special, although it is good for pensioners to have this protection in law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also no surety that once in law it will remain in law even though pensions will continue&mdash;we hope. The `sunset clause' put on maintaining pensions at 25 per cent of average weekly ordinary time earnings found in the two bills, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996&hyphen;97 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 and Social Security and Veterans Affairs' Legislation Amendment (Male Total Average Weekly Earnings Benchmark) Bill 1997, now before the Senate, is an indication of this.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that in pushing for self&hyphen;funding for retirement and for a higher age of payment, and referring to the pension as a `safety net', the government is setting the stage to move to a two&hyphen;tiered system, with a charity payment as a safety net for those without sufficient income based, self&hyphen;funded retirement income. Perhaps we will have `work for your pension'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other measures will depend on the detail as to their actual impact. We have seen how the so&hyphen;called `tax on the superannuation rorts of the rich' contains elements that actually impact on many low and middle income earners and negatively affects all superannuation holders. Measures like the superannuation preservation changes or means tested retirement products are likely to present similar problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The savings scheme was supposed to be the sweetener. On the cut side there are $1.75 billion&mdash;about 1.25 per cent of outlays&mdash;in savings for the 1998&hyphen;99 year from so&hyphen;called  `efficiency' in the Public Service. This is a highly dubious figure unless they plan to sack a whole lot of people. Outsourcing seems to be a big element of it. To put the 1.25 per cent of outlays savings figure in perspective, the general administration cost of Social Security is in total about 3.7 per cent while the percentage going to total general administration in Health is about 1.2 per cent. These are among the departments with the highest administration costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the plan to sell off assets and government properties and move to outsourcing and basically eliminate most functions and staff of the Department of Administrative Services. The loss of jobs in information technology outsourcing itself will be well above the loss of jobs with the BHP closure or the Mitsubishi closure, without even looking at the results of putting confidential information of virtually all Australian citizens into the private sector&mdash;possibly offshore where there would be no commitment ethically or otherwise to Australian privacy laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence from Victoria is also that there are few economic benefits from outsourcing, and substantial drawbacks in terms of degradation of service quality. There 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3509"> are effectively three global information technology firms. Their record of staying on budget and of service provision is not good. We will be shifting information technology costs from public employment of Australians to international employment of transnational employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The announced `family' program, mainly about home care of the severely disabled, is effectively a con. While there are real winners as well as losers, this is overall an area of cuts, not new expenditure. It also should be seen in the context of moving responsibility for the old and disabled off government and onto families. This is really about facilitating getting these people out of hospitals and nursing homes. It is along the same lines as turning the mentally disturbed onto the streets and calling it integration into the community. It is not about proper alternatives to institutionalisation; it is about shifting costs onto families, charities and the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rural and regional measures are a ruse. There is an announcement of plans to make Austudy more available to people with two children or more away at school. It may allow richer people, whether or not they are farmers, to get Austudy benefits if their children are boarding. It does nothing to address the more fundamental problem of assets tests, which disqualify many farmers from a range of benefits and I assume will still apply. This may be more of a benefit to the rich than a help to struggling farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an announcement of a new, four&hyphen;year rural package. The $200 million for this is pretty neatly offset by the elimination of the $196 million for the rural adjustment scheme. If one then counts the reduction in the rural communities access program&mdash;that is, minus $2.4 million&mdash;then the total new funding is really only $1.6 million. This is not a big new program and there are other cuts that will impact the rural sector, such as the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation and the fisheries resources research fund, an environmental fund. There is also the decline of $20.6 million over four years in funding for natural resource management.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additional quarantine funding around fish imports will hopefully improve the situation many senators have complained about, though what is really required is a less complacent attitude towards imports of potentially problematic food products in response to the free trade agenda. It appears that, instead, it may be a plan to open to imports and pay for some of the inevitable damage to industry. A big part of the increase will not be an improvement in quarantine. It will go for redundancy payments for 700 sacked AQIS inspectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme are a questionable measure. Where there are generic drugs available, it may make sense to ask that they be used, rather than supporting big drug transnational corporations; however, the use of a price representing the lowest cost generic drug of `similar clinical effect' ignores real differences between drugs, particularly in relation to potential side effects, drug intolerance and so on. In situations of heart and circulatory problems or cancers, it is common to have to try a variety of drugs to find the ones that cause least upset, particularly if used in conjunction with other drugs. Here is yet another example where the government has avoided bringing in a change of regulation for a better treatment of patients. Rather, it has put the cost onto the community, those least able to make those changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A fundamental area of injustice is that doctors prescribe and pharmacists fill prescriptions, but it is the patient who will pay. Those least able or likely to fight for lower cost options are the elderly, the less educated, those who are recent migrants or those who are otherwise socially `shy'. Those most likely to argue could be university graduates and those who feel confident in their social right to question and object. In other words, this is another area where the pre&hyphen;existing inequities already in the community will be allowed to exacerbate those inequities in future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A wide number of drugs for common, non&hyphen;serious ailments, including non&hyphen;prescription drugs, will be cut and, hence, rise substantially in price. Will it cover such things as ventolin for asthmatics? Asthma is a very 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3510"> common ailment in Australia, which has the highest incidence in the world. Asthma can be life threatening but is rarely so. This is the sort of thing I imagine may be cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a huge range of other cuts in this budget: child care, energy, foreign aid, legal aid, the Human Rights Commission, the ABC and SBS, Abstudy, higher education, social security, health and labour market programs. The social infrastructure areas remain targets. This is a budget designed to give to the rich and call it a benefit to the battlers. This is a budget designed to give equal opportunities that only the wealthy can access. This is an attack on ordinary people.</PARA>

This calendar event is looked forward to by students, their parents and the local community. It is a highlight of the Easter ceremonies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the passion play this year, under the guidance of the new principal, Miss Julie Newbury, the Labor government supported a decision to ban the scripture teachers from producing the play in its present form because of the explicit nature of the violence portrayed. I would like to read the script of the play, taken directly from the Bible. It states:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Governor's soldiers led Jesus into the fortress and brought him together with the rests of the troops. They stripped off Jesus' clothes and put a scarlet robe around him. They made a crown out of thorny branches and placed it on his head. They spat on him. They took the stick from him and beat him over the head with it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have not read from the script used by the students, but from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bible</EMPHASIS>  which I used to make my oath to this parliament and from where the script is taken.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are we to expect that this book from which I have just read is to be banned from our school libraries because of the explicit violence it describes throughout, not just in Matthew chapter 26?

The latter article reports on the new program designed to stop gay vilification, requiring students to study in state schools gay positive theatre and fiction text that normalise gay lifestyles. I wish to highlight the irony of the New South Wales state government's involvement in the proposal to introduce a program to teach tolerance and in the same breath supporting the ban of a school play which depicts a story from Chris

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise once again to raise the concerns of hundreds of thousands of people in southern Sydney regarding the plan by the coalition government to give them an airport at Holsworthy&mdash;an airport that they do not want; an airport that represents a most deceitful and dishonest decision by this coalition government to inflict great pain and suffering on the people of that region. As honourable senators know, I have made many speeches in this chamber regarding this issue. Indeed, the minister on duty tonight, the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Parer, is well aware of this as a couple of years ago we both served on a committee that looked at the issue of aircraft noise in Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure Senator Parer would agree with me that when we sat on that committee&mdash;and they were in opposition and we were in government&mdash;at no stage was any mention made of the possibility of an airport at Holsworthy. When one group decided it wanted to tell the committee its ideas about how you solve Sydney's airport problems by building an airport at Holsworthy, the committee regarded that as a bit of a joke and did not support that in any way. We know that at the last election the current government, the then opposition, said to the people of Sydney that the second airport for Sydney would be built at Badgerys Creek. They supported the policy of the then Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I want to outline further facts about this most disgraceful matter because it is becoming increasingly clear that this government really do want to put an airport at 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Holsworthy. They just do not have the courage to tell the people that is what their plans are. The people of the Sutherland shire, the Hughes electorate and the Liverpool, Wattle Grove and Campbelltown communities know what the real agenda of this government is and they do not like it. They do not trust this government because they do not believe them. They have been deceived. Increasingly, they are venting their outrage and their opposition to this crazy proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course they are right to do so because how can you believe a government that have deceived the people in this way. They failed to tell the electorate what their real intentions were. It is becoming worse because all the time the minister keeps saying that the government still has as its priority Badgerys Creek. It is my belief&mdash;and it is the belief of hundreds of thousands of people in the community&mdash;that that is not the case. Whilst the minister says that, the member for North Sydney says, `No, you are going to have an airport in Holsworthy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, this tendency to deceive and mislead has now even struck the member for the electorate in which I live, the member for Hughes, Mrs Danna Vale. Mrs Vale recently sent a letter to thousands of homes in the community of Engadine. I and many others have received a letter which is clearly a form letter&mdash;sent out by a direct mail service no doubt. I want to quote from that letter. I have provided copies to the minister on duty because I will be seeking leave to table them later. This letter is addressed to Mr and Mrs Forshaw who live in Yarrawarrah, which is North Engadine for those who do not know the location as well as I do. The letter starts off:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr and Mrs Forshaw</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I regret I was unable to join those constituents at the meeting held at Engadine on 30th April 1997.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I interpose to advise the Senate that a large public meeting was held at Engadine on 30 April. I spoke at that meeting and the local state member, Mr McManus, also spoke. Mrs Vale was unable to attend. Her representative, a local Liberal councillor, spoke at the meeting. He apologised for Mrs Vale's non&hyphen;attendance and stated that she had a prior engage 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3512"> ment at a function in another suburb within the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were over 2,000 people at that meeting&mdash;that is not a rugby league game estimate; that is a real figure. The hall was overflowing and there were people on the footpaths and on the streets outside. There was a huge crowd peacefully expressing their anger and their disgust at this government's attitude. It was unfortunate that the local member was unable to attend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go back to the letter that the member has written, obviously because she has become concerned about the strength of the opposition coming from the community in her electorate. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I regret I was unable to join those constituents at the meeting held at Engadine on 30th April 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately I was not invited to the meeting and I first found out about it when I read it in the "Leader" the week before. I had a commitment of long standing to host the Youth Forum in Menai that night, which placed me in a dilemma.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The people at the meeting that night were not happy that Mrs Vale was not at that meeting, but they accepted that she had a prior commitment. Mrs Vale in that letter that I have just read from says that she was not invited to the meeting and that she only heard about it when she read it in the local newspaper the week before&mdash;the local newspaper being the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">St George and Sutherland Shire Leader</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer to another letter that Mrs Vale has written. This time it is a letter to the local state member Mr McManus, the member for Bulli. A large part of his electorate covers the same area. It was Mr McManus who was involved in organising that public meeting. The letter is addressed to Mr McManus and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Ian</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While I support your endeavours to stop the airport I will be unable to attend due to a conflicting community engagement of long standing. I am to speak at The Youth Forum at Menai.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is abundantly clear that Mrs Vale is deceiving and misleading thousands upon thousands of residents of the region because the letter 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that she sent to Mr McManus indicating that she was unable to accept his invitation and acknowledging that she was invited to the meeting was sent on 24 April&mdash;a week before the public meeting. Yet Mrs Vale's letter, sent to all the constituents of the area&mdash;I might say that this letter has on the back of it a survey form seeking certain information from constituents&mdash;tells people that she was never invited to the meeting and that she only heard about it in a local newspaper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know what the people out there in the community would say about this, and I know what a court of law would say about this, when you have evidence, on the one hand, of a letter sent to the state member a week before the meeting saying, `Thank you for your invitation. I am sorry I cannot attend because I have got a prior engagement'&mdash;not an unusual thing to happen to local members&mdash;and, on the other hand, of the letter I received this week in my letter box and that was received in other letter boxes right around the electorate saying, `I was never invited': the member is trying to mislead and weasel her way out of this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I finish by quoting further from the letter that she has sent to the constituents. In the third paragraph, she says:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1M6">Senator ALLISON</NAME><STATE> (Victoria)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(8.58 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I spoke last night about the reluctance of this government to seriously address the question of public health risks associated with telecommunications equipment and in particular about the question of adopting the precautionary principle. I will resume that speech this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke about the contradictions inherent in the statements made by the Department of Communications and the Arts and their so-called fact sheets, the facts available to us in the research available, particularly from recent studies, and the uncertainty to which the government departments admit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand, Senator Alston's department is stipulating that adoption of the precautionary principle is based upon knowledge of a potential effect and that it has not been adopted because there are no potential effects. On the other hand, members of the Department of Communications and the Arts EME team are making public statements that there may indeed be such effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These last statements are supported by the contents of this department's discussion paper that was made available to the public when it was calling for submissions on research strategies. This paper outlines much of the emerging data on how low radio and microwave frequency may potentially be the cause of health effects. For example, on page three, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of interest are the studies suggesting the possibility of hazards resulting from low-level environmental fields . . . these may be roughly divided into two categories: general health surveys and cancer studies. The first group have not established any clear evidence of adverse health effects, with the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> exception of some studies that reported an excess of some autonomic and central nervous system complaints and symptoms generally consistent with those of mild depression. Nevertheless, the possibility of a true association between exposure to RFR and psycho&hyphen;physiologic nervous system reaction cannot be ruled out.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And turning the page, one reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Athermal effects are not well established, that is, very few studies have been replicated, and currently do not form a scientifically acceptable basis for restricting human exposure to RFR.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is my understanding of the precautionary principle that if there is any evidence at all of a threat to public health from an environmental contaminant or indeed anything that is newly introduced as an emission into the environment then it is commonsense, if not an obligation, on the part of authorities to adopt that precautionary principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was told recently by a member of one of the television crews here in Canberra that technicians working in an outside broadcast van suffered from testicular cancer. These technicians operate controls from a seat at the rear of the van, under which is located the transmitter and batteries. Their employer concluded that there was a likely cause and effect and chose to adopt the precautionary principal. That is, the television station did not ask, `Where is the substantiated evidence that electromagnetic radiation is causing this cancer?' They simply took measures to shield the equipment. No doubt they were worried about law suits as well as the health of their employees but the point is that they took the initiative. Of course, avoiding this risk is somewhat easier than, for instance, removing the risk for 4&half; million users of mobile phones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a responsible course of action to warn consumers that certain products may harm their health, just as we do on cigarette packs. It is a responsible course of action to protect employees from harm occasioned by occupational hazards. We warn people about the dangers of drink driving and we impose heavy penalties for those who drink and drive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In every case I can think of, where there is a possibility of health risk, governments at least take steps to educate or regulate. Some risks will be much more obvious than others. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3514"> Some risks, like those associated with electromagnetic radiation, are not immediately apparent. It is a substance which cannot be touched, cannot be seen and cannot be felt. If the risk is not particularly high, society accepts that it will be, generally speaking, a matter for individual choice. But to not have an informed choice is not to have choice at all.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear a lot about choice from this government but information of the factual sort is a lot harder to extract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest to senators in this place that the government has been wrong-footed by the demands of the industry in this respect and that oft repeated phrases trotted out by Senator Alston's department and the industry, such as `there are no substantiated health effects from exposure to mobile phone towers', presumably have their origins in the public relations firm used by the industry and bear little resemblance to the real situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also remind senators that it was not necessary for the government to have the health effects of tobacco use substantiated before finally adopting a precautionary approach. It is surely obvious and logical that according to all definitions of precaution it is not necessary for evidence of health effects to be unequivocally proven before precautionary measures are implemented. It is quite wrong, in my opinion, to demand absolute proof of health effects when current research clearly suggests that future generations may be at risk of gradual cellular mutation from accumulated low-level microwave irradiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even the ESAA formally adopted the precautionary principle in 1991, which was then endorsed by the government in 1996. The ESAA states that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overriding purpose of the precautionary principle is to eventually reduce exposure to magnetic fields in our surroundings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Given that Swedish government authorities have also issued policy guidance to help decision makers consider the EMR and public health effects issue, one has to ask: why can such good sense not prevail in the wireless debate? According to the Swedish brochure, the principle for initiating the effort was that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no research findings to justify Limit Values, but there is reason to he cautious. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am also advised that around three&hyphen;quarters of the world's top bio&hyphen;electromagnetic scientists advocate prudent avoidance&mdash;and that perhaps half of these believe that the public exposure standard should be about one tenth of what it is today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the Woollahra council has recently banned mobile phone towers from being installed within a four kilometre radius of homes, schools, hospitals, child&hyphen;care centres and aged&hyphen;care centres. That is a clear indication, I think, of public feeling on the matter.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One strategy for implementation of precaution could be a reduction in the public exposure standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope I have been able to make it clear tonight and yesterday that the government has not only attempted to deceive the Australian public&mdash;probably by using a public relations firm to gloss over and suppress the emergence of very important research information&mdash;but that it is also reluctant to concede there might</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3515">
<PARA STYLE="Para">be a case for introducing the precautionary principle, as this may force the government to face unpleasant facts regarding previous irresponsible policies on public health and democratic process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston's department has severely mismanaged the EMR and public health debate and earned himself nil credibility in the eyes of the public. Thousands of petitioners who put forward this view to my office are testimony to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In view of this situation, I believe there is a case for requesting that responsibility for electromagnetic radiation and public health ought to be shifted from the Department of Communications and the Arts, from telecommunications, to the health department. I urge senators here and the government to immediately review the public exposure standard and to adopt policies that reflect this precautionary approach.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="9.06 p.m." PAGE="3515"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 9.06 p.m.</EMPHASIS>
