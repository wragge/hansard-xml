<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my first opportunity to congratulate them on their appointment to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people might say that, because of the backdown of the minister and the government three or four weeks ago to drop completely any move to change cross-media ownership rules in Australia until possibly after the next election, Senator Brown's second reading amendment or my second reading amendment are no longer relevant. We still think it is very relevant to put on the record in the Senate that this Senate is opposed to the suggestion of cross-media ownership rule changes in Australia that would allow the further concentration of media ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think my second reading amendment is technically better worded than Senator Brown's amendment, although I do not disagree that the thrust of Senator Brown's amendment is in the same spirit as what the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6532"> opposition has put forward. The first part of my amendment to the second reading motion points out that the bill we are dealing with now is a technical amendment to deal with a particular case that has already been well described in the second reading speech when the bill was introduced. It deals with what we believe is an unintended consequence of cross-media ownership rules affecting radio and newspapers in the Brisbane and Ipswich area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have indicated from the very beginning that we would support the legislation now before us. However, with this second reading amendment we now have the opportunity to put on the record our opposition to any further concentration of media ownership in Australia. The first part of my amendment says that we are more than happy to deal with technical amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act&mdash;and that is what this is&mdash;however, if we are going to have major changes to cross-media ownership rules in Australia, they should be put forward only after there has been a full, open and independent public inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government should have no problem supporting paragraph (a) of my amendment. Why? Because in their better communications policy document for the last election, that is what Senator Alston, as the shadow minister for communications, promised. Unequivocally, without any amendment and without any qualification the government promised that they would hold a full, open and independent public inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, over the last 15 months there has been an extraordinary change in the minister. First of all he backed down from having a full public inquiry. He junked and broke his own promise. He then said the department would conduct an internal review and seek submissions. That went forward. There were submissions sought, but the submissions were not automatically made public unless those making them wanted them to be made public. People who wanted to make a secret submission, could make one to that departmental inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the inquiry apparently completed its work, the report never saw the light of day. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The minister did make some remarks which he later said he did not say, but it was reported by Anne Davies in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> some months ago that he, the minister himself, said that his own department's report was a tired document and not much use. That is what he did to his own department. He bagged his own department and bagged the report he asked them to complete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we went through several months where the minister kept putting up different options for cross-media ownership rule changes in this country. He, apparently, was in almost endless meetings with his own parliamentary backbench. They were hostile to any proposals he put forward. He never put any rationale other than this was apparently some arrangement that would bring good favour from Mr Packer. We believe this parliament, this Senate, should have an opportunity to declare that we support what the government promised at the last election&mdash;a full, open and independent public inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paragraph (b) of my amendment says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that inquiry has established that the change will not in any way lead to further increases in the concentration of media ownership in Australia".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We want to make it clear that any such inquiry should have as a guiding principle no further increase in the concentration of media ownership in this country. If there are ways in which we can increase the diversity of media ownership, we would support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this government in doing a deal with Mr Packer and apparently making some promises in private before or at the time of the last election said, `No, we will allow you to be able to purchase a newspaper chain'&mdash;namely, the Fairfax chain&mdash;`and still maintain the ownership of Channel 9 when the present law specifically prohibits people from owning a newspaper chain and a television network.' We have yet seen no evidence from the government why this ought to be changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we got the extraordinary backdown. Cabinet overruled Senator Alston and told him to tell people privately he was backing away and that the government had more important things to deal with. This is extraordinary because for 15 months Senator Alston did nothing else but go all over the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6533"> country talking to every media proprietor and every media interest group he could get hold of, including his own backbench, to convince them to change the law to allow Mr Packer and his organisation to buy Fairfax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For 15 months this issue was a very high priority for this minister and this government. We had the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on several occasions saying that he disagreed with the present legislation that prohibits the owning of a television network and a newspaper chain in this country. So this was a major issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apparently, this issue was discussed several times at cabinet and they could not reach agreement. In the end, the cabinet and the Prime Minister dumped on this minister and said, `You will not proceed with this. We are putting this off the agenda until after the next election.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister again has proved that this minister is his doormat. He dumped on Senator Alston and told him what to do about cuts to the ABC and cuts to Radio Australia. Now, after 15 months of effort, he has told Senator Alston, `Forget about changing the cross-media ownership rules. This is getting too tricky, too sticky and too tough to deal with, and my government can't reach an agreement.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why we still believe it is important to move this second reading amendment as an expression of opinion from the Senate that, even after the next election and even if, unfortunately&mdash;and I emphasise `unfortunately'&mdash;the Liberal Party is re-elected to government&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FORSHAW" NAMEID="656">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No chance.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with you, Senator Forshaw&mdash;no chance at all, given the way they have handled the bungling of media issues in Australia. Even if the government unfortunately did win, we want to make it clear that it will not be able to change these rules to suit a deal for a particular proprietor to give a greater concentration of media in this country. We believe that the Senate should express its view on this important principle and this legislation gives us the opportunity to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With those few remarks, I commend to the Senate my amendment to Senator Brown's amendment. I think the opposition's amendment is technically more correct. However, we are not opposed to the sentiments that Senator Brown expressed during the second reading debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the amendment does not change the substance of the legislation itself, which we support. We have indicated our support on a number of occasions. We believe that the legislation addresses an unintended consequence that affected the ownership of a regional newspaper in Ipswich and a radio station in Brisbane. The cross&hyphen;ownership rules were not in any sense designed to catch them. We believe that support for this amendment will not compromise the cross&hyphen;ownership rules. We have made that very clear. I hope that the Senate will support my amendment. I commend both the amendment and the bill to the Senate. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Omit all words after "the Senate is of the view that", substitute "apart from technical amendments to address unintended consequences, Australia's cross&hyphen;media ownership rules should not be changed unless:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME><STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.48 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. I had not intended to speak at all. I do have an amendment but I am convinced that as this is a technical bill it may not be the best possible vehicle for my amendment. I understand that further amendments will be proposed to the broadcasting services legislation by a bill which will be introduced into the parliament this month or thereabouts. It may well be that the most appropriate timing to move my amendment would be then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the amendments, I believe that there needs to be a greater and more in&hyphen;depth discussion than we have had about this matter thus far. This is a matter that affects us all. I have not heard any arguments, other than those that have been advanced by Senator Brown and Senator Schacht. To be quite 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6534"> frank, some of those arguments are quite compelling. I believe that these sorts of amendments ought to be the subject of a debate of greater depth than we have had thus far. No doubt the two honourable senators would be able to apply themselves to that task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, without having heard all of the arguments&mdash;and I would certainly like to hear the arguments from the government; we do not have the minister here today and I have expressed my view about that&mdash;I am not in a position to vote on the amendments to this technical bill.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="6534" TIME="12.50 p.m." SPEAKER="Campbell, Sen Ian" NAMEID="H15" ELECTORATE="WA" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I would thank the senators who have made contributions to this debate, both today and on a Thursday many weeks ago. I thank those senators who have indicated support for the technical nature of the bill. The main topic of debate, however, has nothing to do with the bill&mdash;it has been to do with the debate on cross&hyphen;media ownership laws. The government concurs with Senator Harradine that it is an important matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, it is in the hands of opposition senators to debate this matter at a time that suits them. They could move it as a general business notice of motion and spend all Thursday afternoon debating it. If they wanted to they could spend an entire Thursday afternoon debating the ins and outs of cross&hyphen;media policy. I know that would be a very sensible opportunity to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has been available on virtually all of the occasions that the bill has been listed for debate. It has become somewhat of a saga actually getting this bill to the stage where it is about to receive a second reading. But, as all of us in this place know, bills do not always come up on the day on which they are listed. In fact, the odds of that occurring are very low. Senator Alston does have to be in another city of our great nation of Australia at this time and I think he would particularly want to apologise to Senator Harradine for not being here to answer some questions that I know he has on a matter which is vaguely related to this topic. I am sure that, on his 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> return to the fine city of Canberra, he will make himself available to talk to Senator Harradine.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (lines 4 to 6), <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">TO BE OPPOSED</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">There is opposition to these schedule items because this legislation is a backdoor means of changing the cross&hyphen;media ownership rules in Australia. As I have said before, it effectively gives the nod to what has been an anomalous situation for a regional newspaper in Ipswich to be outside the cross&hyphen;media ownership rules. Its circulation breaks those rules because it is in the same region as a radio station owned by the same proprietor, the O'Reilly group of Australian regional newspapers. To get around this, they have been putting some 6,000 copies a week of their Ipswich newspaper into the Toowoomba market next door. They have been allowed that technical means of getting around the current cross&hyphen;media ownership rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation in relation to the current cross-media ownership rules says, `We won't even have you go to that expense. We'll change the rules. We'll change the rules in such a way that you'll be able to continue to sell your newspaper in Ipswich where you also have a radio station covering the same territory.' The problem with this change to the rules is that three other regional newspapers also are free from the binds of the previous 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6536"> rules. Those newspapers are in Warwick, on the Gold Coast and in Maitland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you make another small change to the rules which is very consistent&mdash;just change the percentage that is named in these regulations from two per cent to four per cent&mdash;you get around the current protection for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age,</EMPHASIS> and you have the situation where Mr Packer may purchase those newspapers. If you are going to have this rule for somebody who owns a radio station altered to allow the continued ownership of a newspaper in a regional area outside the current rules, why not make a consistent small change to allow a television proprietor to purchase newspapers in metropolitan areas? It is all very consistent. The pattern is set. The breach of the rules has been made legal. Why not extend the two per cent to four per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with this legislation is that it is not a technical change. It is a major change to the media cross-ownership rules being validated under the guise that it is only a small change affecting somewhere in the rural region. It is not. It is a very clear change to the rules opening the way for another consistent change to the rules, which also can be labelled minor, to change in a major fashion the media ownership structure in Australia and to breach the very strong feeling there is in our community that we already have too much of an agglomeration in the hands of too few people of the media outlets in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the Greens stand very strongly against this. We are the only party in this chamber that does stand strongly against this change that is occurring here today. I have given the other reasons for our opposing it in the past, but we believe this change should not come without a major, thorough public inquiry. I am disappointed that we have just seen the government, aided by the absence of Independent Senators Harradine and Colston, block the amendments which would have required a proper and open inquiry before any changes to the media ownership rules were permitted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is backdoor. It endorses an anomalous situation which the authorities had been 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> turning a blind eye to. It sets the pattern for much more worrying changes in the media ownership rules to allow further agglomeration of media ownership in this country where there is very, very strong and popular opposition to that sort of thing happening. It is going through the parliament this afternoon. It is going through the Senate this afternoon. If the Australian public knew the ramifications of this piece of legislation, they would be outraged.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said that Senator Margetts may have provoked me, and unfortunately she has. I just want to make it clear that the opposition has stated on a number of occasions that the position that was put before us by the O'Reilly newspaper group or Australian Provincial Newspapers was done openly. They have lobbied the government. They have lobbied everybody. It has not been a secret lobbying, I have to say. In fact, it has probably been persistent, if I can use that word. They have been very open about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6537">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has discussed this amendment at some length through all its internal processes&mdash;that is, the caucus committee, the shadow cabinet, the full caucus and now here. So we reject completely Senator Margetts's claim that there is silence on our part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple case of why we believe this is a sensible technical amendment is that there is no increase in concentration of media ownership taking place as a result. It means that because Australian Provincial Newspapers own a radio station in Brisbane and they own a newspaper in Ipswich, and because the definition of a metropolitan radio market means Brisbane takes in Ipswich, which is geographically close by, under the existing rules they cannot own a newspaper unless that newspaper has 50 per cent of its circulation outside that radio defined market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what would the Ipswich newspaper have to do? It would have to print extra copies of newspapers to the level that they would give them away for free in Toowoomba and elsewhere in Queensland, outside the defined market, so that their actual sales come below 50 per cent. It is a wasteful arrangement. I have to say to the Greens, who are always in favour of saving trees, that this idea might have actually saved some newsprint, but that is a minor point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that the radio station they own in Brisbane is not the sole radio station. The metropolitan radio market now is extremely diverse. Many stations are going broke and are being resold. It is not a closed market. Anybody who wants to make a reasonable bid to get hold of a radio station in metropolitan Brisbane will get one soon. There are community licences; there is the ABC. So it is not as though Mr O'Reilly is locking up all the radio stations in Brisbane and the only newspaper. It is an Ipswich newspaper that has some circulation outside of Ipswich into Brisbane, but very little.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe this is a sensible amendment. I have to say to you, Senator Brown, if it turns out that, because of the way the amendment had to be written, another example comes up where there is a loophole and someone says, `This does mean that Mr Packer can get hold of Fairfax,' I would be the first person in here 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to apologise to you, and I would be the first to demand that we amend the legislation accordingly. So we have made it very clear why we have supported this amendment. We believe it is reasonable and, therefore, we oppose your amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R86">Trans&hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill 1996</XREF>  concedes mutual recognition on both sides of the Tasman to various regulatory standards for occupations in Australia and New Zealand and enables the enactment of legislation applying uniformly throughout Australia, so that the two important areas are picked up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In mutually recognising the standards for regulations and occupational qualification between Australia and New Zealand we bring the two countries closer together into a form of common market&mdash;that is, we merge the economies of the two countries more closely together. If there is a standard and uniform set of rules, it makes it easier for business to be conducted in New Zealand or any state or territory in Australia. If there is recognition of Australian trade and other qualifications and of New Zealand ones too, it means that people who have undergone training in any state or territory of Australia and/or in New 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6539"> Zealand can be recognised in both nations for the skill that their qualification confers on them and can conduct or business or carry on their trade in a normal way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a bill that is best described as harmonising the standards between the two countries. It is a bill which had its genesis in 1992 under the Labor government when, while in office, we initiated improved mutual recognition between the countries. But this bill specifically arises from an agreement signed by the New Zealand government and the council of Australian government ministers in the middle of last year, following on that process initiated by us in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said a few words about what this bill does. I will summarise it more particularly. Firstly, goods can be sold between Australia and New Zealand without restrictions caused by differences in product standards and other regulatory requirements. Secondly, persons registered to practise in a mutually recognised occupation are given mobility between the two countries without the need to undergo further testing or examination. The bill also contains a number of exclusions and exemptions which go to medical practitioners, to the field of quarantine, to endangered species, to firearms, to censorship and to certain chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition supports this legislation. However, in the committee stages we will be moving an amendment. The amendment will have the important effect of placing the Trade Practices Act, a number of other acts concerning fair trading and consumer affairs in Australia and the safety of hazardous goods into a special exemptions clause. That exemptions clause will automatically exempt those areas from harmonisation for 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of that time, the Australian Tribunal, as it is referred to in the act&mdash;a body consisting of the Commonwealth government, all of the state and territory governments&mdash;will review what can happen with respect to each one of those acts that are now to be put aside if our amendment is carried. They will then be brought back into this act or extend the time for which they are exempted. That will be a decision for the Australian Tribunal, as it is referred to, or the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> council of ministers, as it might normally be called. When that body meets with the New Zealand government, the effect of the harmonisation can proceed or not, according to the needs of each of these pieces of legislation that have been put aside in the exemption clause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I foreshadow now that I will be asking the minister during the committee stages of this bill whether or not, if our amendment is carried, the government will be indicating to the parliament what it intends to do with respect to each item of legislation referred to in our amendment. I mention that now to alert the minister at the table, the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs and Minister Assisting the Attorney&hyphen;General (Senator Ellison), to this question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, mutual recognition promoted by this legislation ought to encourage greater economic growth in both economies. It ought to encourage therefore higher employment opportunities in both economies. New Zealand is the only country in the world with which Australia has a free trade agreement in effect, and the ANZAC free trade agreement, the closer economic relations with Australia agreement, does enable greater economies of scale to be made between us. People might argue that we should have them with other nations in the world, but that is not an argument for this bill. This bill does underpin the free trade agreement with considerable force. I commend the bill to the chamber, with the undertaking that I will be moving an amendment in the committee stages.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support the basis of mutual recognition of regulatory standards for goods and occupations between Australia and New Zealand. However, we believe that the mutual recognition must be an equitable recognition of both Australia's and New Zealand's interests. I therefore address an issue which I believe fails to equitably recognise the interests of Australia's consumers and which should be incorporated into this Trans&hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments that I will be moving on behalf of the Australian Democrats address 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6540"> this omission by recognising the existing product safety standards in our trade practices laws with respect to goods. The mutual recognition principle means that if goods can be legally sold in New Zealand they may be legally sold in an Australian jurisdiction and vice versa. This is a worthy goal, but it should not be achieved at the expense of Australian consumers' health and welfare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill in its present form includes a number of exclusions and exemptions, such as quarantine, endangered species, firearms, certain chemicals and fireworks, among the lists of Commonwealth, state and territory laws which are exempted or excluded from the operation of the bill. These exclusions and exemptions recognise that there are differences between Australia and New Zealand and that some matters should fall outside this mutual recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe this should also be extended to product safety standards so that Australians are not subject to products which fall below the standards that currently are set in Australia. Australia has a comprehensive and evolving scheme of product safety standards. These standards are relatively high by world comparisons, and we need to be sure that these standards are not circumvented to allow consumers in Australia to be exposed to unacceptably dangerous and harmful products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is the intention of the government with this particular piece of legislation, then it should introduce legislation which dismantles the current product safety laws in Australia. This bill should not provide an avenue for products to be used by Australian consumers where they would be excluded because they are unsafe or dangerous under existing Australian laws and standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the proposed arrangements, products which can be sold in New Zealand may then be imported and sold in Australia without having to meet Australian product safety standards. The same does not apply to reverse trade as New Zealand will rely on its customs control regime to restrict any product that does not meet New Zealand's mandatory standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 33 of the New Zealand Fair Trading Act deems any good a prohibited import 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> under section 48 of the Customs Act if that good breaches a mandatory product safety provision. This customs control regime is specifically recognised in the Trans&hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Agreement. There is no equivalent provision in Australian laws, and specific exemption is required in Australian law to prevent the import of goods from New Zealand that do not otherwise meet Australia's product safety laws. The amendments that the Australian Democrats are proposing should address this concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Trade Practices Act 1974 was amended in 1986 to introduce detailed product safety measures to ensure manufacturers and importers had the initial responsibility for a product's safety. The scheme gave Australian law&hyphen;makers the control over setting standards for the safety of Australian consumers by providing for temporary and permanent bans on unsafe goods, setting mandatory product safety and information standards, the recall of unsafe goods and the review of bans and recalls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time of this amendment the then Attorney&hyphen;General, Lionel Bowen, said of the product safety provisions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new provisions, dealing with product safety and product information, represent a most important development in measures for the protection of consumers. . . In circumstances where there is an imminent risk of illness or serious injury the Attorney&hyphen;General will be able to make an order without delay. In those cases which involve a declaration that goods are unsafe, there will be an opportunity for a conference after the event to review the declaration. The review procedures will provide opportunity for full canvassing and testing of the issues consistent with quick action when necessary to protect the safety of the public.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So this scheme has served us well and should not be undermined at the expense of Australian consumers' health and welfare by introducing inconsistent legislation. This bill is inconsistent because it enables a product to be sold in Australia which does not comply with the Trade Practices Act provisions where that good can be lawfully sold in New Zealand. This undermines the Trade Practices Act and consumer protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This may be illustrated by example. Australia leads the world in the development and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6541"> requirement for car child restraints. The rest of the world is following Australia's lead in this particular area. However, New Zealand presently accepts the existing US and European standards, which are not of the same high standard that Australia has set and, by Australian standards, are inferior and therefore unsafe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the bill in its present form, a car child restraint, imported and made for sale in New Zealand, would be able to be imported and sold in Australia even though it does not satisfy Australian standards. Further, a similar car child restraint could not otherwise be imported and sold in Australia. This sets up an unsatisfactory product safety scheme in Australia and will affect product safety standards set in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other goods include sunglasses, vehicle jackets, support stands, motor bike and bicycle helmets, children's flotation toys, children's nightclothes, fire extinguishers, exercise bikes, et cetera. The vice versa of this recognition is inequitable. Australian goods will be required to comply with New Zealand's product safety standards. This will affect all these areas such as children's nightclothes, bicycles, toys for children under three, et cetera. These standards will require Australian manufacturers importing these goods into New Zealand to comply with these standards. New Zealand's product safety standards are not undermined by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have therefore proposed amendments to this bill which will recognise the importance of product safety standards in Australia and New Zealand and exclude those standards from the operation of this particular bill. The amendments will maintain the operation of the product safety standards and product information requirements that are set out in the current Trade Practices Act. The amendments fall within the categories of exemptions which are already addressed in this bill, so these amendments merely cover an area that is consistent with the scheme as it presently stands, but has not been specifically identified as an issue for exclusion at this point. The amendments will maintain the existing product safety scheme under the Trade Practices Act 1974.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments will exclude all product safety standards from the operation of the bill. However, where particular standards are identified which are consistent with the standards of all jurisdictions, it will be possible under the existing bill to regulate for those standards to be subject to the operation of this law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments will ensure that Australian standards are not compromised by oversight. This bill, without amendment, will also have flow&hyphen;on effects which will be removed by the amendments. The bill will provide importers of goods that do not meet Australian standards an unfair advantage over both importers from countries other than New Zealand and Australian manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where a good is imported directly into Australia and does not meet Australian standards, it will not be covered by the mutual recognition principles. This provides a direct advantage to those that import from New Zealand. Perhaps more importantly, there are likely to be direct effects on the manufacture and sale of Australian manufactured products at the highest safety level which will be required to comply with much more rigorous standards. I commend the amendments to the Senate as fixing an omission from the bill, and suggest that product safety for Australian consumers should be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will make a general comment in relation to this legislation before the Senate which is in the form of a code agreed to by the government for which it is seeking Senate approval. The Senate is not a place for rubber&hyphen;stamping executive agreements between the government and other parties at the expense of Australian consumers. We had no part in the making of this agreement and we cannot ignore this particular oversight. However, the agreement requires only that the Australian draft bill be in substantially the same terms as that agreed by the government. The proposed amendments leave the bill in substantially the same terms and recognise the importance of Australia's consumer protection set out in the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should also note that this bill actually sets out provisions for addressing privacy. In the last session we heard from the government an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6542"> attempt to defend its rejection of a comprehensive privacy scheme for all Australians. This bill is directed towards breaking down barriers to trade and employment, but requires privacy provisions so that it conforms with New Zealand's privacy scheme. So, if Australia's privacy laws are so adequate&mdash;I ask this of the government&mdash;how is it that there is a need for these particular provisions in this bill?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think most people know the answer, and that is that the existing privacy laws in this country are far from adequate, and these provisions are evidence of this inadequacy. So this government's failure to do as it promised&mdash;that is, to extend privacy laws to the private sector&mdash;has left us in a position where we may find trade and employment opportunities affected, especially with countries like the European Union, Hong Kong and, of course, New Zealand, because they are among the countries that are actually doing something to address the issue of privacy. I would be curious to know what the government's response is to the idea that this bill needs to set out privacy considerations if its laws in this country are so adequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I welcome the government's recognition that products banned from sale under the Trade Practices Act would be excluded from the operation of this bill using the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. This concession recognises that there are omissions in this bill and that there is place for a review of this legislation by the Senate. From my perspective, I think the recognition should go further. The amendments I propose should be accepted as full recognition that these amendments plug a hole in this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R86">Trans&hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill 1996</XREF>  is, I believe, a disaster from a consumer standpoint. Australian standards do not need to be met; New Zealand standards mostly do, under their customs prohibited import regulations. The New Zealand Minister for Consumer Affairs acknowledges this and called this a win for New Zealand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The areas that are not covered are: safety standards; quality standards; performance 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> standards; use by and age dating of food; labelling, including country of origin; and ingredient labelling. While some areas of product regulation are covered in New Zealand, labelling does not seem to be. New Zealand parliamentarians have concern that this bill will actually undermine their proposed requirements for labelling of food containing genetically modified products which we do not have in Australia. Health and safety warnings are not necessarily included. That includes tobacco health warnings, which are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The harmonisation of differing standards creates a lowest common denominator effect. This benefits, of course, corporate interests, not countries or people. Where Australia has higher standards, as with baby car seats or cigarette health warnings, our regulations will be undermined. Where New Zealand has higher requirements, as with the potential requirement for labelling of genetically modified food, these will be undermined. Even when regulations are currently in sync, this law will prevent any tightening from being effective unless it occurs in both countries. It is hard enough getting regulations tightened here. This government does not want to require industry to do anything by law, so I do not think it is going happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence from the World Trade Organisation experience around quarantine is that assurances of sovereignty and protection are meaningless. We currently have World Trade Organisation cases against Australian quarantine regulations for chicken meat and salmon as being anti&hyphen;competitive behaviour or potentially anti&hyphen;competitive behaviour. My views on inequalities in trade and the race to the bottom at the expense of nature, workers, industry and&mdash;as in this case and others&mdash;consumers are well known. This is not about New Zealand products. Product from anywhere in the world can enter Australia without complying with our laws as long as they comply with New Zealand's laws and have come through Auckland or some other New Zealand jurisdiction. Just think about the implications over time. I will specifically talk to those later.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6543">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are setting a precedent that will be used as a model. I can imagine the government using this model to take to APEC or some body of ASEAN nations in order to establish a regional trade agreement. Even if there were no regional agreements, I can imagine other bilateral agreements with other countries, for instance&mdash;this is what I was talking about before&mdash;Fiji or Tonga, who then have connections with India. So, perhaps New Zealand will enter a bilateral agreement with Fiji or Tonga on acceptance, perhaps a mutual recognition bill, and Fiji or Tonga, having strong connections perhaps with India, will have a mutual recognition bill with India. In reality, instead of flag of convenience shipping we will have country of convenience trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are setting a precedent that may be used as a model. A network of bilateral agreements would allow the lowest standards in the network to prevail. An example is goods made to Indian standards, on&hyphen;sold to Fiji through a bilateral agreement and imported into Australia under this bill. The goods would be made and labelled to Indian standards and would be labelled as imported from New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Imagine the outcome if imported Indonesian, Vietnamese or Laotian goods were made and labelled to their standards rather than to Australian standards. That is what is on the cards here&mdash;trade agreements are rarely isolated occurrences&mdash;or is the government saying, `This is a once only. We don't want or expect New Zealand to enter into similar agreements with other countries'? I do not think we can actually control the outcome of New Zealand's trade with their other trading partners. The mutual recognition principles, as stated in section 10 of this bill, say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Trans&hyphen;Tasman mutual recognition principle is that, subject to this Part, goods produced in or imported into New Zealand, that may lawfully be sold in New Zealand, either generally or in particular circumstances, may, by virtue of this Act, be sold in an Australian jurisdiction either generally or in particular circumstances (as the case may be), without the necessity for compliance with further requirements imposed by or under the law of that jurisdiction as described in section 11. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a worry. What I have talked about is a fanciful scenario. The implication is that if a particular circumstance, such as this mutual recognition treaty, exists or comes to exist in New Zealand, goods can be legally imported into New Zealand that fall below their national standards. The goods can then be legally imported here. This a formula for rendering our standards useless in relation to imports of anything that is not included in section 12.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also potential in establishing regional or network bilateral agreements for nations to become regulation shelters, where low regulation levels mean that global producers import to the shelter country then on&hyphen;sell to higher standard countries with mutual recognition. This is not a fantasy. We are going to see potential flag of convenience, tax shelter nations&mdash;perhaps nations with low regulations on, and costs for, pornographic phone calls. The latter situation has arisen with telecommunications deregulation, where Pacific Island countries provide a large portion of phone sex services to the United States and Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In such a circumstance, I think we must consider safety standards on quality, composition and performance and labelling requirements as crucial&mdash;particularly labelling. If we are going to make this a free-for-all, with products of vastly different qualities and performance standards, consumers need to know where the products come from and what is in them. There is a minimum requirement to allow any kind of effective consumer choice. Free choice in a market usually, and even according to the theory, means full information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only time this bill will be needed is when standards differ. It is not an argument to say that many standards are the same. Identical standards present no problem for importing. When standards differ, this bill says that the lowest ones apply. Any importer can import to either country through the other with the lower standard. This is the lowest common denominator principle or the race to the bottom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Democrat amendments, I believe the government has sorted out the issues in relation to drafting, but this is not a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6544"> treaty agreement or covenant which we are being asked to ratify. It is Australian law drafted as amendable legislation. This is not the place for the department of trade to usurp their prerogatives and power of parliament within a democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are problems with the way treaties and covenants are drafted without the consultation of the parliament. We have talked about this on many occasions, but this does not even have that status. To suggest that there might be an agreement between Australia and New Zealand that this parliament has to go through with a certain model is rather bizarre. I believe the proposal to omit clause 11(a) is problematic. Clause 11 is an even more detailed version of clause 10.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Non-compliance will always be worse than what we require, since standards are minimum standards. Standards are not set for everything and they are not imposed on producers for fun. If it was worth setting the standards, they were set for a reason. If the government believes there is no reason to have them, it should honestly argue for their removal, rather than requiring them of Australian producers and all other foreign producers except those in New Zealand. It is a bit like the current review of the competition policy legislation throughout the country. Basically, there are some aspects applied to those, but the rest of the reasons why parts of legislation were there in the first base are not really being argued on a fulsome basis&mdash;just on a very narrow criteria. Even in relation to performance, I cannot see why there would be exceptions to something deemed important enough to have a regulation or law about the performance of some goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to food standards, they would largely be set up by the Australian New Zealand Food Authority. I note that section 10(e) of the National Food Authority Act used to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In developing standards for food and variations of the standards, the Authority must have regard to the promotion of consistency between domestic and international food standards where these are at variance, providing it does not lower Australian standards. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Consistency of food standards was explicitly the least important of five items. The other four in importance were protection of health and safety, provision of information to enable consumers to make informed choices, promotion of fair trade and promotion of trade and commerce. Protection of health was the most important issue&mdash;if order on the list was to be taken into account&mdash;and the issue that raised the critical protective phase in the fifth subsection was the promotion of consistency providing it does not lower the Australian standard. That was actually removed at the end of 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time, Senator Sherry was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The issue was harmonisation of food standards, and the fear was that the change would allow a reduction in food standards of the sort I have brought up in the past in relation to World Trade Organisation bills. At that time, Senator Sherry referred to the fact that, at the time this trans&hyphen;Tasman mutual recognition arrangement comes into force, Australia can seek temporary or permanent exemptions for food standards and quality, and he passed on the assurance of government that, if standards for maximum permitted contaminants, or MPCs, and maximum residue levels, or MRLs, in relation to food were not harmonised, then such an exemption would be sought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, Dr Theophanous, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health, gave a letter of assurance of a much broader ambit saying that Australian food standards would not be dropped to international standards and the quality of food would not drop. Of course, there has been a change of government since then, and the phrase about not allowing standards to be lowered in harmonisation is now gone from law. I would be keen to find out from the relevant minister whether this government would allow food quality to drop&mdash;will he allow a reduction in MRLs or MPCs? I will ask that in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our amendments, I oppose clause 11(b), which would allow all imports through New Zealand to be an exception to our labelling standards where New Zealand regulations are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6545"> lower. Senators would be aware that labelling&mdash;both food and country of origin information&mdash;is a highly contentious issue. There is no reason for setting up a situation where there are exceptions to our labelling laws, nor a situation where changes to our legislation are reflected in labelling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be arguing these issues when we put our amendments. There is a stronger case in my belief for our amendments and those of the Democrats, but I will certainly be looking at the ALP amendments when they are put in the committee stage.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to rise on every occasion that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) has sought to change ministerial arrangements in this chamber. In fact, in the 18 months since the election, I have previously not commented. It was something that was a very regular occurrence from Senator Hill, and I think all senators in the chamber would know that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the opposition is concerned, we consider that Senator Vanstone's absence from the chamber this week is outrageous, given the appalling performance that we have seen from her, especially over the last couple of weeks. I do not think she should be allowed out of the country, let alone to represent the country. You have got to ask yourself: what does Senator Vanstone have to offer her APEC colleagues? If they want to know how to denigrate a public education system, if they want a blueprint to destroy higher education, if they want to promote job insecurity, perhaps they should ask Senator Vanstone. But she ought to be here. Her primary responsibility is to be here in the Senate chamber, not attending overseas conferences. When Senator Hill was Leader of the Opposition, he was very keen to point out ad nauseam that ministers were paid real money to attend parliament, and that they should meet their first responsibility, which is to front up here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is probably the case that Senator Vanstone finds it absolutely impossible to defend what has been an appalling performance. We frankly do not believe that she is up to facing questions this week in the parliament. We will be very interested in, and will be pursuing questions about, Senator Vanstone's management of the South Pacific Cruise Lines fiasco. We consider this absence to be nothing more or less than a pathetic attempt to avoid her responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the chamber note, as I hope other senators will note, that apparently Senator Vanstone is also going to be absent to attend an OECD function from 3 October to 19 October. This is the minister who said that she would front up to the Senate estimates committee. There is only one reason that Senator Vanstone is out of the country 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6546"> for three out of the next four weeks; that is, to escape her responsibilities.

Some of Labor's debt, which the government is still repaying, was incurred at interest rates in the order of 14 per cent. We are turning that sad legacy around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last May's budget reported that net debt as a share of GDP would be almost halved by the year 2001, which is less than four years away. The government is also reaping the benefit of lower long&hyphen;term interest rates. In July, for example, the government issued October 2007 stock at an interest rate of 6.5 per cent. At noon today, the yield on the 10&hyphen;year bonds was just 6.13 per cent. You have to go back almost a quarter of a century to find yields around that level. Over time, lower interest rates will have substantial benefits in terms of lower public debt and interest cost to the budget, thereby providing significant benefits to the community. Lower bond yields are possible because the inflation outlook is good.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam President, I can understand why Senator Ferguson looks somewhat puzzled, given this government's very poor record of addressing the critical need of job security for Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Saturday was a black day for Australians who have reached the age of 55. The importance of what happened on Saturday is that for the first time when Australian workers lose 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their jobs they will have their superannuation assets assessed for the purposes of social security payments. What does this mean? Some Australian workers have conscientiously, over the last 10, 20, 30 years&mdash;whatever the time period may be&mdash;accumulated, in many cases voluntarily, superannuation for their retirement. But, of course, 55 is not the age of retirement in this country; 65 is the age of retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is occurring at the present time&mdash;Senator Ferguson would do well to take note of the many thousands of complaints that have been expressed about this particular new provision&mdash;is that if an Australian worker loses their job and is unemployed for nine months they are faced with the prospect of having their social security payments reduced or cut out altogether. What is their response to this&mdash;I do not refer to it as just being nasty; it is vicious&mdash;new policy of this government? They will be forced to draw down on all or part of the superannuation that they have accumulated, struggled to accumulate, in many cases, over the last 10, 20 or 30 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we questioned Senator Hill about it today he referred to it as a `subtle policy change'. It is none too  subtle for those persons affected by this new deeming provision of superannuation. They will be hit with a literal financial brick wall when they reach the age of 55 and nine months. They will be required to draw down on part of or all their superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This change represents, as I said earlier, a very nasty, a very vicious, measure directed not just at Australians who have saved for their retirement in respect of superannuation but at a group of Australians who are at their most vulnerable: Australians who are 55 and have lost their jobs. In the current economic climate&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FERGUSON" NAMEID="EP5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EP5">Senator Ferguson</NAME></TALKER>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not voluntary retirement, Senator Ferguson. You are wrong. You front up to the Newcastle workers who have lost their jobs or are going to lose their jobs. You front up to the workers from my own part of Tasmania at Tioxide or the pulp 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6562"> and paper mill. They have complained long and hard about this particular measure. Those workers lost their jobs at the age of 55 and have very little chance and very little opportunity of finding alterative employment. Senator Hill refers to this as a subtle government measure!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, other measures came into effect on Saturday as well. It is not just superannuation that is affected; it is also annual leave, sick leave, long service leave, maternity leave or any other liquid assets, excluding the family home, in excess of $5,000 for a couple or $2,500 for a single person. As I said earlier, they are vicious and nasty measures. These last measures will affect just over 103,000 Australians. The worst news for battling Australians who lose their jobs at the age of 55 is that more and more people who have accumulated superannuation assets when they reach the age of 55 and cannot find another job after nine months are being effectively forced to declare themselves retired to access their superannuation money before they reach retirement age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has not heard the last of these measures from out there in battling Australia. Battlers, particularly battlers at the age of 55, strongly resent these measures. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the motion. I am absolutely amazed to find that Senator Sherry has to take note of a broad range of questions. That indicates quite clearly to me that he has no expertise or knowledge about anything. He is just throwing a few things into the ring. The reality of the situation with which this country is faced today is that that lot over there broke the spirit of this country: they broke the spirit of small business, they broke the spirit of large business, they broke the spirit of the miners, they broke the spirit of the people on the land and so on, as you work through the whole issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why did they do that? How did they do that? In your period of government you oversaw the highest unemployment since the Great Depression. That is your record. You oversaw the highest level of bankruptcy since the Great Depression. That is your record. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> You want to remember that. You had the highest interest rates since the Great Depression. I well remember debating these particular issues in this place. Remember when housing interest rates were at 17 per cent? Remember when business was paying between 23 and 27 per cent? That is your record. That is your legacy to this country. That is the damage you did. We have set about rebuilding it. We have made a significant number of changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will address some of those changes right now. Interest rates are at their lowest since the mid&hyphen;sixties. What have we done with small business? We have introduced a capital gains tax rollover so that they can expand and go on to other businesses. They can be flexible. They can deal with the issues beforehand. But they have to get their confidence back before they can start employing people. You will see that very soon, might I suggest. We have made reforms to the fringe benefits tax. What did you do? You put a fringe benefits tax on the right of somebody to park their car. That is the sort of action you took. You drove people away from the work force. You put the cost of business up&mdash;you consistently did that. We brought in a one-stop shop for small business. We can go on through the list as far as small business is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what was done for rebuilding rural and remote Australia. Labor drove our producers into the ground. That is what you did. You drove them into the ground. I re&hyphen;emphasise that a large number of people came to us and said that they were forced out by virtue of the fact that they were paying interest rates of between 23 and 27 per cent. And you want to try to run a business. If you had ever run a business, you would not have let that happen. It takes a lot for people to get over that, but they are getting over it. They are reducing their debt. They are getting their businesses back into perspective and, to assist them, we announced last week a new farm management deposit scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember that, after our drought inquiry, then Labor senator Bryant Burns said in this place that people on the land must have a system where they can put aside a haystack of money. But what did you do about it? 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6563"> Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. That is what you did about it. We have done something about it. We put the farm management scheme in place and it will bring reform.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why don't they go and talk about youth unemployment? The number of unemployed youth, based on the trend figure, is 82,500. The government's own forecast of 8.25 per cent unemployment by the middle of next year is completely unachievable. So you do not get a big tick for effort; you get a big cross for effort. And you are also not going to get unemployment below eight per cent, on the words of your own employment minister.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6564">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are talking about the minister for employment, let us look at precisely what she has said. She has spoken about a number of things over the last couple of weeks, and I do not think any of them were particularly helpful to the other side. The reason I think Senator Sherry took the opportunity to take note of various answers given by Senator Hill is that there is so much to talk about. There was so much to talk about, we just could not choose. We decided that, rather than take note of one answer, we would go for the smorgasbord approach and take note of all of those answers. It is the smorgasbord approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at precisely what Senator Vanstone said. She said, `We need a freer labour market and lessened job security to reduce unemployment.' That is what she said; that is a fact. She said, `You have to have, it might be described as, lessened job security. It's not a message everyone wants to hear.' That is also a fact. People do not want to hear that message. She also said earlier this week that the government's spending cuts were partly to blame for high unemployment&mdash;a claim Mr Howard was forced to deny.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EP5">Senator FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly. The point that Senator Sherry is trying to make is that people are being forced to access their superannuation accounts if they are over the age of 55 and are no longer in employment. What I am saying is that Senator Sherry ought remember what the policy of the Labor Party was for 10 years prior to 1993; that is, that people should access it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry refers to the workers&mdash;the battlers&mdash;who are forced to access their superannuation accounts. Senator Sherry is very fond of using the term `workers,' as though they are the only people who ever accumulate superannuation. In the early 1980s those people who had some sort of accumulations in general terms were those who were not the workers. The people who are now, to use your term, being forced to access&mdash;those who are being forced to use any accumulation they have&mdash;are in no different a position to the position of a small businessman who owned a corner shop and poured all of his resources into that shop without having a separate superannuation account. If he sells that shop or if he goes out of business and has only a small amount of assets&mdash;for instance, $100,000&mdash;under the system of your government, right through until 1996, he was forced to access that before he could access any job program or any pension whatsoever.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I am saying to you, Senator Sherry, is that in those days you were quite happy for a person who had no superannuation to have to access any accumulation that he had in his own name. The only thing that you said was sacrosanct was any superannuation contribution which he might have had in his name, whether or not that person chose not to work or even to seek work until the age of 55.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Mackay does her little bit of play acting, asking herself rhetorical questions and supplying predictable answers. She talks about levels of unemployment. Senator Mackay, you must have a very short memory. Although you were not in this place between 1990 and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1993, I am sure that, in your role in Tasmania, you were heavily involved in the union organisation. I cannot remember you ever making any major complaints to the then government, when in fact that government was responsible for the highest unemployment levels this country had seen for 60 years. Were you as outspoken in your position then as you are today about levels that are somewhat lower than they were in 1990&hyphen;93? I think close to 11&half; per cent was the highest it got to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During that time when we were having the recession that we were told we had to have&mdash;the Labor government said we had to have a recession&mdash;interest rates were almost the highest they had been in history, to my knowledge. So many people that I know were forced out of small business. Many people on the land were forced out of business because they found themselves paying 24&hyphen;27 per cent interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have a situation where this government has low inflation and low interest rates. It is trying to remedy the position that we found ourselves in upon taking office in 1996 and being left with the 13&hyphen;year legacy of those opposite. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7L6">Senator HOGG</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The particular issue that I want to look at is the issue that you have caused the greatest trouble with; that is, job security. You have ruined job security in this nation. You have done so systematically in the Public Service. You have ruined the expectations of people who had a job in the Public Service, who earnt an income, who earnt a living. All you have to do is look around Canberra to see what you people have laid to waste in your period in government. It does not just stop there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Someone earlier in the debate spoke about the Australian Taxation Office. I met someone from the Australian Taxation Office who had come near to being tapped on the shoulder. That is what it is about. We hear that there are no compulsory redundancies; there are nice taps on the shoulder. It is going on currently in Foreign Affairs. No-one is going around railroading anyone out of a job. You get a polite tap on the shoulder and you are told, `It's about time that you moved on. It's about time that you stopped filling up the space here. We've got to create some more unemployment.' That is what you are the government of, and that is the way it is approached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what do we see? We see people like this driver who was previously with the Australian Taxation Office saying because of the great uncertainty created by this government, `Enough is enough,' and getting out. That is pretty much the story around town and around the Public Service throughout Australia. The great uncertainty that this government has caused has led people in despair to take a package and to get out. There is uncertainty about where the next dollar is going to come from. So what do they do? They opt out and&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7L6">Senator HOGG</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, and that is the other option that is available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the answers that Senator Hill gave us today we heard some nice rhetoric. We heard about reforms in place, economic growth&mdash;as my colleague Senator Mackay has already alluded to, there is no economic growth&mdash;and the foundation has been laid. One would think this was a chookery with us getting things laid now. The truth of the matter is that small businesses have no confidence in this government whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Senator Crane to make the assertion that they are rebuilding the rural and remote areas is a nonsense. If one looks at what has happened in rural communities alone over the last 12 months, one will see that there have been a substantial number of bank closures. Banks are one of the major areas that provide employment in those rural areas. If you look at recent statistics that came out of the Reserve Bank, you will find that, in the last 12 months, 400 branches of banks closed throughout Australia&mdash;in my state alone, 57 branches closed. This leads to a lot of job insecurity because of the policies of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The paramount thing on the lips of people these days is job security. All we see are the policies of this government making people feel more insecure. When giving answers today, Senator Hill spoke of flexibility. `Flexibility' is one of the key words associated with the casualisation of the work force. Casualisation breeds nothing else other than uncertainty in the work force and pessimism among the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what do we see? We see this government persisting with these policies and going down the path of causing more heartache and more stress in the working community. This government has to live with the fact that it is against real job security for people in the community and it has done nothing with its economics to underpin and lay down a successful platform for jobs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps you would leave that for me to comment on, Senator Sherry. If we are talking about job security, we need to ask why in September 1997 employers are still very wary of putting on extra employees and taking that step which would lead to increased employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SHERRY" NAMEID="ZW4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator Sherry</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No confidence.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GX5">Senator TROETH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suggest that the no confidence that the employers are displaying is due to historical facts, of which I would like to name a couple.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, employers have only just gained more certainty in the way in which their businesses are run by the introduction of a much fairer unfair dismissal law, which came through in the coalition's workplace industrial relations policy which went through the Senate last year. I understand that the number of unfair dismissal applications has been cut by half compared with those applications that went through before that legislation was dealt with. This means that an employer can employ someone and know that, if the due procedures take place and if that person proves unsatisfactory, they would then not have to keep that person on, as was the case under the previous legislation. That gives them a great deal more certainty to employ people in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I suspect that employers are still recovering from the 1990 recession&mdash;the one which you will remember the then Treasurer Mr Keating described as the recession that we had to have. That proved to be extremely unfortunate for small business. As Senator Hill pointed out today, record numbers of both small businesses and individuals were plunged into bankruptcy. Interest rates were so high that many Australian businesses and individuals went to the wall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, businesses are still recovering from the uncertain economic climate created by other comments made by Mr Keating during his time as Treasurer indicating that this nation could go down the path of a banana republic. What does that do to inspire business confidence in anyone?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, what do we have today in the realm of job security created by this government? The Treasurer (Mr Costello) has announced that there has been a growth lift in the June quarter for the national accounts. We have the lowest inflation for 30 years. We have had five cuts in the interest rate since we gained office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to point out to Senator Hogg, who, unfortunately, has just left, that the deregulation of the financial system announced by the Treasurer in his acceptance of the Wallis report will mean the entry of new providers into the financial system and that will mean that there will be a much greater&mdash;dare I say the word&mdash;`smorgasbord' for businesses to choose from as to who is going to loan them money. That competition alone would mean a reduction in interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts in spending that we have had to make to reduce the deficit from the $10 billion that it was when we gained office have meant that this country has been placed on a much better economic footing. Similarly, the Treasurer has noted a growth in business investment which must predicate that business is starting to spend money. You would expect that further down the track that will lead to a growth in jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a high level of vacancies. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> telethon on the weekend pointed out that there are jobs available. The fact that employers are willing to go into the public eye and put those jobs forward means that there are jobs there. In due course those jobs will become available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to point out to Senator Hogg again that the rural package announced by the Prime Minister some 10 days ago does give hope to the farming sector as far as job security is concerned. Intergenerational transfer from father to son means job security. Banks have closed, which is a commercial decision by them, but again the deregulation of the financial sector will mean that other lending providers will come to the fore in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have taken the hard decisions and put to shame the abysmal 13&hyphen;year tragic record of the opposition in failing to create job security.

There are very few people in our history who have inspired humanity, received global accolades and gone about their modest business of giving succour to the very disadvantaged, to the poor and to the ill in our community. Mother Teresa, of course, was one of the few.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mother Teresa, by birth, was an Albanian. She was the daughter of a middle class, in fact, well&hyphen;heeled businessman. In 1950 she founded her order, the Missionaries of Charity, to help the poorest of the poor, the sick, those dying in the slums, the beggars, the lepers and the thousands of abandoned children. Her faith and determination was quite extraordinary, faced with what could only be described as a daily parade of human suffering and hopelessness. It is also true to say that lesser spirits would have cracked under those sorts of trying conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dominique Lapierre, the author of the book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">City of Joy</EMPHASIS>, describes Calcutta as a `cauldron of misery, injustice and violence'. Mother Teresa said she received her call to tend the suffering of Calcutta while on a train, travelling through a railway tunnel on the way to Darjeeling. She responded to that call. Her mission over the past 45 years has been to ameliorate some of the suffering that has been caused by the massive poverty of India. Her hospice has assisted more than 100,000 people over those years. Her calling, obviously, has motivated thousands to follow her. I think there are now 5,000 sisters in the order which spans all continents. The order is assisted by many millions of lay workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that Mother Teresa's call will not be lost by her passing. There is no doubt that the women in the Missionaries of Charity and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6569"> many other organisations will continue to be inspired by Mother Teresa's indomitable spirit and the example that she has set, and will continue to work to alleviate the sufferings of the very disadvantaged in our society.

We learned of the death of Mother Teresa two weeks ago. I was informed of that particular event at the National Party conference in Canberra.

Everyone there was deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Mother Teresa, whose life was an example and an inspiration to many people throughout the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mother Teresa was born in 1910 in what is now Macedonia. Her mother, a devout Catholic, instilled in her a special awareness of the needs of the poor. At the age of 18 she left home and joined the Order of Loreto, whose nuns worked in India at the time. In 1948, Mother Teresa received the blessing of the Pope to begin her own order which was set up to serve the poor. Her order, the Missionaries of Charity, began in the slums of Calcutta and then expanded throughout the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1952, she founded her first home in India. The following year the mission spread internationally from Venezuela to Rome, Tanzania and New York. In 1969, the Missionaries of Charity opened a centre for Aborigines in Bourke. The charity now owns more than 450 centres in over 100 countries around the world, feeding 500,000 families a year. The size of the mission is a reflection on her strength and tireless efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mother Teresa was devoted to her work and it is said that she would sleep for only four or five hours a night, spending her days working 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hands&hyphen;on at schools and hospitals, administering her order and praying. Her efforts were rewarded many times. She received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979, the Nehru Award for International Understanding in 1972, and an honorary Order of Merit from the Queen in Delhi in 1983. She was also awarded the Companion of the Order of Australia in 1982, which is the highest general award that can be presented by this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Her efforts were felt here in Australia as they were around the world. In recent years, Mother Teresa had experienced ill health. She suffered a heart attack and underwent surgery but still continued as head of the order until early this year. Mother Teresa worked to provide dignity for all people through hospitals, schools and missions. She provided education, medicine and hope. She will be sadly missed, but her charities will survive as a monument to her life.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to associate the Democrats with this motion of condolence on the death of Mother Teresa. St Paul addressed many of his letters to the New Testament churches with the words `To all the saints' who are in this or that city. Most of those who were addressed by St Paul were less than saints, at least as we understand that term today&mdash;that is, in some way close to perfect. Rather, Paul's saints were human beings with all the  failings for which human beings are known. The saints in the church of Corinth, for example, caused Paul great concern. But the critical factor for St Paul was that they responded to the call of Jesus Christ to follow him in caring for those who live at the edges of life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The call for Mother Teresa to be recognised in a formal sense as a saint by the Roman Catholic church is appropriate. In another sense, the sense in which it was used by St Paul, Mother Teresa in her earthly life was already a saint&mdash;that is, a human being  sub 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6570"> ject to human failings but someone who responded magnificently to the call of Jesus Christ in her life. Nor does one need to agree with everything that a saint says to recognise the depth of their commitment. Her views on contraception and abortion were controversial. However, in responding to the call of Jesus Christ, Mother Teresa fulfilled, to a remarkably high degree, the words of Jesus Christ in Matthew's gospel:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For I was hungry and you fed me; I was thirsty and you gave me a drink; I was a stranger and you received me in your homes, naked and you clothed me; I was sick and you took care of me, in prison and you visited me.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the article referred to by Senator Faulkner, Dominique Lapierre refers to Mother Teresa as a saint in this sense. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have followed many of these saints in the homes for the dying, in the leprosy centres, the orphanages, the asylums of the City of Joy&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A short rickshaw ride separates the walls of the old Woodlands clinic where she died from the place where Mother Teresa's crusade began. The cataracts of the monsoon were pouring over Calcutta that summer of 1952.

There is a good deal of money involved in that and she applied that to helping the poor. She was materially poor herself, as are her congregation. She put all of the money to assisting the poor and vulnerable. She accepted the Nobel Peace Prize for the glory of God and for the good of his creatures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She is admired by all, and one wonders why. She did not distinguish between persons. She did not distinguish between Hindus, between Muslims or Christians. She accepted that all were created and that they had an inherent human dignity that should not be violated as a result of that gift of life from God. Her key to her mission was her humble simplicity. Asked who she was, she once said of herself:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By blood and origin, I am Albanian. My citizenship is Indian. I am a Catholic nun. As to my calling, I belong to the whole world. As to my heart, I belong entirely to the heart of Jesus.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As Senator Woodley said, she followed in the steps of the Lord, and she did that how? The first Bishop of Jerusalem, James, said in his epistle that true religion is caring for the widow and orphan&mdash;the most vulnerable of human beings&mdash;and keeping uncontaminated from worldly values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly she cared for the most vulnerable. She was often misunderstood, but she cared for the most vulnerable not only in the areas of assistance&mdash;physical and medical&mdash;but in more profound areas of person to person contact. She and her sisters believed that spending time with people, particularly the dying, was far more important than the technology that might be applied at that particular time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She established homes to care for those AIDS sufferers who were dying. She established three such homes in the United States of America. It is very revealing to see how she and her sisters, not judging at all but caring for those people, seek to ensure that, as she said, they do not die in distress but die knowing that somebody loves them and die with gratitude, because that time of death is probably one of the most important times of a person's life.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6571">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She spread the message of joy. She and her congregation cared for the beggars, the destitute, neglected mothers and their babies, and the lepers. As you would know, many of those lepers became deeply attached to her and to her sisters. She was able to understand the meaning of suffering, something which we find very difficult, and how it can build an understanding compassion which then can be spread to others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, she was sometimes misunderstood. I saw an article the other day which was somewhat critical but I noted that it was based on what the Calcutta cocktail set observed as to why certain of the money she got did not go to the building of clinics, et cetera. Of course, much of the money did go to that, but, as she said, she and her congregation were not primarily social workers; they were in fact following in the footsteps of the Lord and caring for the poorest of the poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She did accept and encourage persons in the medical profession and the legal profession and in other callings to also follow in those footsteps and use their particular capabilities and their training for uplifting the downtrodden. She did attract many volunteers from all over the world to work with her, particularly with her work in India.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of James's explanation of religion, of course, is to remain uncontaminated from the values of the world. Mother Teresa prayed the prayer of deliverance from the desire `to be extolled, from the desire to be honoured, from the desire to be praised, from the desire to be preferred, from the desire to be consulted and deliver me Lord from the desire to be popular'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She held to the view, and lived it out, that silence holds an important place. Interestingly enough, she established her first house of contemplative nuns in New York city. In the midst of the rowdiness of New York city, she established her first contemplate convent&mdash;an oasis of silence in that raucous city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As she said, the fruit of silence is faith. In the silent depth of one's heart, one can hear then more clearly the word of God. The fruit of silence then is faith, and love is the fruit of that faith and understanding of who God is and the fruit of love is service and the fruit of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> service is peace. I wonder whether that attainment of peace is the preserve of persons like Mother Teresa, or is there a message for us here in the parliament? It seems a bit rich at first glance, in our occupation to be praying for deliverance from the desire to be popular.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a problem. I suppose I am a bit of a hypocrite in saying that because I can remember that one of my election campaign slogans was `Harradine&mdash;the name says it all'&mdash;bugger all! Of course, Mother Teresa was talking about the inordinate desire to be popular, to be consulted. But if we look at those things that she was talking about&mdash;the inordinate desire of being praised, the inordinate desire of being consulted, the inordinate desire of being approved, the inordinate desire of being popular&mdash;it is something that we should consider. After all, if politics is about the harmonious arrangement of the civil order with a view to establishing a more human society, unselfish virtues are more important than many of the other traits that we exhibit in our daily activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to join with my colleagues in honouring Mother Teresa and in recognising the inspiration that she has given to so many people not only those for whom her inspiration has been part of the call to be members of her particular congregation, but all of those who have helped and are continuing to help to uplift the downtrodden. I congratulate the government, the opposition, all of the parties&mdash;the Australian Democrats, the Greens&mdash;and all of the members of this parliament for supporting this motion put before us. I guess this is not something that Mother Teresa would have sought, but it is certainly something that is worth while for us in our quest to do our bit to uplift the downtrodden.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are still the only Australians, sent overseas on active service, whose service has not been recognised in three important areas:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. R.A.N. casualties are not yet included on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial alongside Army and R.A.A.F. casualties;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. R.A.N. service has not yet been recognised with the visible signs of service to Australia; the Returned from Active Service Badge and the Naval campaign medal; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. R.A.N. service is still not acknowledged as eligible service for the Australian Service Pension, while service by Commonwealth and allied veterans from 55 other countries is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members of the Army and R.A.A.F. who served during the same period in Malaya had their service fully recognised 24 hours after arriving in Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1997 Budget the Government partly recognised that R.A.N. service was `operational' and accepted responsibility for disabilities resulting from that service. However, government departments are still resorting to old, and inventing new excuses, to deny the above 3 points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request that the Senate acts to help remove the injustice of 40 years and fully recognise R.A.N. service by providing the same recognition and benefits for that service. The cost will be minuscule, being mainly a transfer of pensions from `age' as paid by the Department of Social Security, to `service' pensions, paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator Faulkner</NAME><FROM>(from eight citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great privilege for me to stand here today as a new senator representing the great Labor state of New South Wales, and to follow in the footsteps of Senator Bruce Childs, who repre 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6578"> sented the Labor  movement of New South Wales in this chamber for many years, with great passion, humility and commitment. Having worked closely with Bruce over many years, I sincerely hope I can make as significant a contribution in this chamber on behalf of the working people of New South Wales as he did. I take this opportunity to wish him well and every success in his new role as President of the Evatt Foundation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to this chamber as a representative of the Australian Labor Party, one of the oldest and greatest social parties, a party forged out of the great union struggles of the late 1800s to give workers a parliamentary voice, a party charged with the responsibility to represent their class interests and a party whose foundations have been built on values that I have always been committed to: fairness, equality of opportunity and social justice for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also come here after spending virtually the whole of myy working life as a full&hyphen;time official of the trade union movement. I have been active on both the industrial and political sides of the labour movement since I arrived in this wonderful country in 1965.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly proud to have been afforded the opportunity to have worked as a full&hyphen;time official of the trade union movement for some 26&half; years and to have played a part in the achievements of the movement over that period of time. Its list of achievements on behalf of ordinary working people have been many. For example, to name but a few, there has been maternity leave, adoption leave, parental leave, family leave, standard working hours, redundancy provisions and superannuation, as well as continuous improvements in many others such as occupational health and safety, annual and sick leave, wages, and other general working conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are conditions of employment many in the work force today take for granted but for which their forebears fought and sacrificed to achieve, and which now, in the new industrial environment, are continuously under threat. Amongst those who were at the leading edge of those struggles were unions such as the metals, building, mining and maritime workers. It should be understood that when 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unions such as these are under attack our union heritage is under attack. Those trade unionists will not surrender that heritage lightly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know it is popular for those on the other side of this chamber to decry those achievements and to vilify trade unionists, but you cannot ignore the facts and you cannot rewrite history. Madam President, the trade union movement has been and continues to be a critically important institution in a democratic society, not only in promoting and protecting the interests of its own members but also in contributing to both the production of wealth and the production of our society as a whole. I am proud and privileged to be a part of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am acutely aware of the decline in union membership that has occurred in recent times as the union movement, like others in our community, has had to grapple with the impact of economic rationalism, globalisation and structural change. Despite that decline, and unlike the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), I have every confidence that the union movement will be around as a force for good in our society for a long time to come and, I suspect, for a long time after the minister and his party have become relics of history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My involvement in the labour movement has been particularly rewarding as it has enabled me to contribute in a meaningful way to the development of my adopted country and, most importantly, to improving the general standard of living of working people. I should declare now, if it is not already evident, that I have an abiding bias on behalf of working people and those in our society who are less well&hyphen;off. It is a bias for which I make no apologies and which guides all of my thoughts and actions&mdash;past, present and future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, I believe in a fair society and I believe in a socially cohesive society. I believe it is the responsibility of every citizen, either collectively or individually, to contribute to achieving that goal. Regrettably, at present, Australia can claim to be neither. Instead we have a society that is racked by insecurity, divisiveness and inequity. The challenge we face as politicians and as a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6579"> community is to find the solutions to those problems that are at the heart of that insecurity, divisiveness and inequity, the greatest of which is the spectre of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment no longer confronts those currently employed but also those currently unemployed. The significant shifts in employment trends globally over the last decade or so, which have seen the rise of contract, casual and part&hyphen;time employment, as well as rising numbers of self&hyphen;employed and unemployed, have contributed significantly to the fear and anxiety that grips much of today's work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, it is fair to say that the spectre of unemployment has become a management tool in some industries and enterprises, particularly in the non&hyphen;union sector, to intimidate and control the work force. This has led to the development of the high stress, low trust workplace culture being a major feature of our enterprises in the 1990s. This is an inhibiting factor in achieving the levels of competitiveness necessary to compete in the global marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, if we are to build a socially cohesive society in this country, then we have to tackle head&hyphen;on the preoccupation with economic indicators. We have to challenge the sanctity of the market, and we have to put the interests of people ahead of theoretical, economic purity. This will require us to focus monetary and fiscal policy on achieving broader social objectives such as full employment, greater equity in disposable incomes and comprehensive health and education services and away from narrow economic objectives such as zero inflation, low interest rates and a balanced budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not that these objectives are unimportant&mdash;they are&mdash;but our economic agenda should be driven by the needs of our people, not by the sectional interests of the finance markets. Our economic solutions do not depend on selecting one set of objectives over the other, but in achieving harmony with both. Regrettably, however, in this current environment, when major issues of social concern arise it is the views of the leading finance market analysts that tend to dominate the public debate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a sad reflection on our society, for example, that announcements of rising unemployment can be greeted with rising share prices, as has occurred in recent times, or that a decision by one of our largest companies, BHP, to close its steel making facilities at Newcastle, affecting the lives of thousands, can boost its market value and lead to windfall profits for it shareholders. There is something askew in our society when some can benefit from the misery of others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, we need to harness all of the creativity and resources of our society in seeking the right political solutions to our current unemployment crises. We need to develop a national political agenda, the central feature of which is a comprehensive, national and regional industrial development strategy&mdash;the essential building blocks to a diversified economy capable of sustaining high levels of employment and improving living standards across all sections of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That national agenda should be focused on trade and industry development policies to expand and strengthen the tradeable sector and its component parts; stabilisation policies to assist and sustain annual growth at four&hyphen;plus per cent over the course of the business cycle, and supporting policies that contribute to the goal of reducing and sustaining unemployment levels at less than five per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Key elements of such a national development strategy must be: promotion and support of innovation by individual companies, including incentives to encourage a greater direct contribution to research and development; adequate supply of venture capital for start&hyphen;up companies, as well as changes to the tax act to encourage and reward patient capital over the pursuit of short&hyphen;term profit taking; a suite of initiatives aimed at assisting our companies to expand their activities into the global market by improving their export performance; the development of a bank of regional and national infrastructure projects that can be initiated at various times over the life of the economic cycle to sustain high growth rates in the economy; effective skills development and labour market programs that enhance the opportunities for the unemployed 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6580"> and underemployed to obtain sustainable long&hyphen;term employment consistent with the needs of the economy; and recognition of the role that information and communication technologies will play in improving and sustaining the competitiveness of our industries into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is critically important that we identify where information technology can be utilised across our economy as a major tool of economic growth and, more importantly, to ensure that it is effectively exploited. This will require the deployment of significant resources directed at rapidly raising the level of computer literacy across all levels of our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a nation, Australia sits at the crossroads. We have a small window of opportunity over the next five to 10 years to position Australia for an exciting future in the global economy. That future can be as a central player with a sophisticated mixed economy and a strong hold in the emerging industries such as food processing, information technology, particularly software development, and biotechnology, to name but a few, or we can be relegated to the role of fringe dweller providing the raw materials out of which others will extract the real added value. Whether or not we take advantage of the opportunities that come our way in the global marketplace of the future will be determined by the capacity of our companies in the tradeable goods and services industries to produce and trade well. If we as a nation wish to stake our claim to that future, then the time for visionary decision making is now. The current debate around the Mortimer and Goldsworthy reports and the future direction of industry policy will test the substance and courage of our current political leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, it is not appropriate for Australia or Australians to seek to play an inclusive role in the global community in an economic sense whilst seeking to play an exclusive role in an social sense. We cannot expect to be embraced by the global community in economic terms whilst there are those amongst us who reject that embrace in social terms.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have watched the debate develop in this country over the past 12 months initiated by the maiden speech of the Member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). It has reminded me of my own political experiences as a young person growing up on the streets of Belfast where it was not uncommon for politicians to wrap themselves in a cloak of nationalism of whichever brand happened to appeal and to promote a platform based on ignorance, fear, prejudice and hatred. I can see no difference between the approach of the One Nation party and the politicians who strutted the streets of Belfast in the fifties and sixties. We should heed the calls of those who have said to put One Nation last, for those who do nothing to stop this cancer growing are, in the end, just as culpable for the outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately, a cohesive society is one whose philosophy is built on community interest, not single&hyphen;minded selfishness, and it is one which is motivated by community spirit, not by individual greed. That is the society I will strive to build as long as I am a member of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, I wish to conclude by expressing my thanks to my party for nominating me to this important office, and to those many comrades and good friends right across the Labor movement who, over many years, have supported and encouraged me. There are far too many to name personally. I want to express particular thanks to the members of my union who showed faith in me by continually electing me as their representative. I will always be in their debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to express my gratitude to my two children, Geordie and Cory, for sharing me for years with my extended family, the trade union movement. They have turned out to be good citizens, despite an absentee father, and I am proud of them both. To my wife's parents, Trudi and Oscar Weil, whose support and encouragement has been unwavering, I express my deepest gratitude. Finally, Madam President, to my partner, Kerrie, who for the last 12 months or so has been my political sounding board, my adviser, my personal trainer, my soul mate, my wife and my best friend, I owe her more than I can ever repay. I thank honourable senators.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for Australia to agree to legally binding targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The reason we have moved this urgency motion is that it is obvious that our government is very reluctant, indeed determined, not to have a part of what we will argue today is essential&mdash;that is, binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Why do we need them to be binding? I think it is fairly obvious to all of us that the `softly, softly approach', `how about we get on with it', `isn't this a nice idea?' has not worked. We need binding targets if we are actually going to seriously address this huge problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Australia signed on to these targets, it would firstly, and most importantly, help it to protect the environment, but it would create jobs, it would be of long&hyphen;term benefit to our 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> economy and, as far as the international community is concerned, we would actually be a part of it, rather than a renegade. We would actually take our place as an important player&mdash;as I believe we should be. After all, we share this planet and we must be responsible for its long-term wellbeing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not spend a lot of time on the environmental impacts. I think most of us are well aware now of the predictions of sea level rises, the impact on biodiversity, the loss of biodiversity&mdash;indeed, the loss of entire ecosystems&mdash;the increasing frequency of storms and the growing regularity of the oscillation between drought and flood. Even the insurance industry, particularly in the United States, is becoming more and more active as it realises the cost to it of doing nothing about the increasing frequency of storms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's reaction to the environmental impacts has changed between trying to put them down as minor and suggesting that anybody who seriously considers them is talking about an apocalypse. I suggest that the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) should look at who is actually making these suggestions. If he did, he would find it is a group of the world's most eminent and leading scientists in this area&mdash;indeed, it is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Even Brian Fisher, the head of ABARE and the man who produced the Megabare model on which you base your position, does not dispute that sea levels are going to rise. His frightening suggestion though is that, rather than worrying about it, we should invite those people from the South Pacific over and have them here as environmental refugees. He suggests that that would be more economically efficient. I suggest that is an attitude this government should not sign up to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is one of the highest per capita emitters of greenhouse gases in the world, yet here we are trying to build a special case to say that, basically, we should be left alone and we should be allowed to have it our way. This government is using very hollow rhetoric in saying that Australia really is entitled to argue from that position. If you actually examined the facts, you would see how hollow that is. The government asserts that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6582"> we are doing the best we can and that we have voluntary systems in place, but let us just look at some of the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us start with land clearing. Land clearing is about 25 per cent of the problem; it, therefore, has the potential to be 25 per cent of the solution. What does this government do? It lets the Natural Heritage Trust go through and gives money, through that trust, to state governments that are still engaging in wholesale land clearing. Here again, I point out the activities in Queensland. It would not only be a good idea for the greenhouse problem if we stopped that wholesale land clearing; it would be a good idea for our fragile soils, our need for water resources and our biodiversity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at what the industrialised world has been able to do, we see that it has reduced its energy use per unit of economic output by 25 per cent in the last five years. Australia has only managed five per cent. There is a huge potential to do something better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we can look at the domestic sector. The estimates are that Australia could halve its emissions from the domestic sector, and they are at 17 per cent, by encouraging things like solar hot water services, by actually requiring appliances to have energy efficiency standards&mdash;I must stress here that this is normal in the rest of the OECD; we are again so far behind on this&mdash;and by implementing decent building codes, something else on which we are so far behind. I am reminded here of a recent article I read that stated that a piggery in Germany requires better insulation than homes in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirty&hyphen;nine thousand times Australia's daily energy requirements fall on this country every day in the form of solar energy, yet only four per cent of our domestic hot water services are solar. Californian wind farms generate more electricity than the entire Victorian coal fired system. There are real opportunities out there for Australia to develop new technologies, to get clever and to tackle the greenhouse and unemployment problem at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) keeps saying that agreeing to cut greenhouse gas 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> emissions will cost the economy jobs. Even if that were true&mdash;and I stress that it is not&mdash;he does not make mention of the damage to our economy of not cutting greenhouse gas emissions. What is going to happen to Australia if exports are affected? If Europe or the United States decide to impose the same energy efficiency standards on imports as they do on domestically produced products, what will that do for Australian jobs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happens if climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions disrupts our climate patterns, causing more extreme weather conditions, more droughts and more floods? Of course we will suffer. We only have to look at what is happening now under El Nino&mdash;and I acknowledge here that the jury is still out as to whether or not there is a connection between greenhouse and El Nino&mdash;and the impact of that short-term climate change over the last few months and the $2 billion that it is now estimated it will cost the Australian economy to see what long-term environment change will do to our agriculture sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But will cutting greenhouse gas emissions actually cost jobs? The government keeps citing ABARE research&mdash;funded of course by the coal industry&mdash;but how credible is that? It fails to factor in the economic cost of doing nothing. It fails to actually acknowledge that industry can make significant advances on fuel efficiency and that industry can switch to alternate energy sources. Even in the short term, if it is a bridging fuel such as coal, enormous savings in emissions can be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What they fail to mention is that a proactive government, a clever government, could put in place a mix of policies which would achieve significant reductions in greenhouse gases and actually benefit the economy. The House of Representatives environment committee in 1994 commissioned a study of the economic effects of climate change and policy changes to cut greenhouse gases. In that study they modelled a tax on carbon emissions big enough to reduce greenhouse gases back to 1990 levels. That would have raised enough revenue to completely abolish payroll tax. So we would tax energy more and tax employment less. The results from the study were a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6583"> rise in GDP of about a billion dollars, a rise in employment of 55,000 jobs and a fall in carbon dioxide emissions of 11.7 per cent. I think those results are very exciting. What does this government do? It ignores them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The challenge of needing to meet binding targets would create new industries in this country&mdash;high&hyphen;tech jobs in areas like renewable energy, energy conservation and efficiency, recycling, insulation and so on. All of these technologies would be of immense benefit to us and we could then export them into Asia as the developing countries are brought on line once the developed world&mdash;those of us who have the financial ability to make the necessary initial changes&mdash;have set the standards and set the example. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contribution of the Australian Democrats on this matter, which is of international importance and national importance, continues to be disappointing. The subject that they have chosen today is the issue of legally binding requirements. Basically, what they are demanding of Australia is that it accept a legally binding requirement before we even know what that requirement would be. One would have thought that that could only be interpreted as an irresponsible position to take, but, on the basis of what we do know about the likely cost to Australian industry and to Australian jobs if that legally binding target were of the type that is being talked about by Europe, it is an even more irresponsible position to take.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Australian Democrats are saying is that they want Australia to adopt a certain position, even if it costs literally thousands of Australian jobs. In other words, Australian jobs are not important to the Australian Democrats. I think that that is disappointing. They would make out a stronger case if the sacrifice of Australian jobs actually achieved a better global outcome. But the sad thing is that it will not. That fact was not addressed within Senator Lees's contribution either. All she wants to do is, to use her words, paint Australia as a renegade, paint us as somebody who is claiming or wanting to be left alone, when quite the contrary is in fact the case. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Her errors continue with her claim that much of the problem relates to land clearing. Land clearing in Australia is slowing and therefore it is a reducing contribution.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not growing. I regret that this debate is not being set on a factual basis, which would therefore be less alarmist and a more useful contribution to public discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important thing is that Australia wants to contribute to achieving a better global greenhouse outcome. We accept the science. We accept that climate change is occurring. We accept that there is a warming of the environment, that it is occurring more rapidly than records indicate that it has occurred in the past, that the likelihood is that it is a result of human actions&mdash;this is what is different from the past&mdash;but that the full consequences of that are still unknown. That is the scientific fact, which is accepted by all of us.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FAULKNER " NAMEID="5K4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator Faulkner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Except John Howard.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is accepted by John Howard. You did not listen to what he said. On that basis, it is sensible to behave in a prudent way. It is acceptable to adopt a cautionary position. That is the position that the Australian government has adopted. That is why we want to be part of a strong outcome from Kyoto, one that can give hope for the future that the pace of the increase in climate change can be restrained, that we can actually achieve a position of stability and then ultimately a position of reduction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are, of course, talking about a long-term issue. Nobody is suggesting that in the next 20 or 30 years there will be any substantial change at all. Certainly there will not be under the Berlin mandate, because any reductions that occur on the part of developed countries will be taken up by developing countries. Nevertheless, it is prudent to take action now to ensure that in the long term a basis is put in place to give confidence that the international community as a whole will join together to provide a better greenhouse outcome. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6584">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is no dispute about where we as a government stand on that issue. Our position is quite consistent with what the previous Labor government held as well; that is, that it is an important international debate, that we need to be part of it, and that we need to be part of a solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next issue is: what is a solution that will work? The position that we have always adopted is that, for a Kyoto outcome to work, it will have to be seen to be fair and achievable. In other words, if countries are asked to take a disproportionate share of the burden, it will fall down; it will not succeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the lessons that should have been learnt from the pledges that were made post&hyphen;Rio is that, unless they are realistic, unless they have been thought through, they will simply lead to disappointment, because nearly all of the countries that made these pledges post&hyphen;Rio have not met their expected claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has to be a fair outcome. The facts of life are that a uniform reduction will apply an unfair burden upon Australia. It will treat Australia unfairly. In fact, it will treat Australia more unfairly than any other country. This is simply because of the nature of our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that we are a major energy producer, the fact that we are a large consumer of coal because it is such an economic fuel in this country, the fact that we are a major player in terms of agricultural and other primary production, and the fact that we are a major processor of basic minerals&mdash;all add up to a unique economic picture that means that Australia's production of emissions is comparatively high and is likely to increase even with efficient production and efficient industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are going to ask Australia to take a burden 20 times as high as a European state, then it will simply not work. You are asking Australia to make an unfair sacrifice&mdash;I would have thought any senator in this place would recognise that. You are also asking for an outcome at Kyoto which will ultimately fail. That is why we have argued the position of differentiation. In other words, differentiate the economies, work out what are the substantial differences in the economies of annex one 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> countries and work out what pain each would have to bear to equitably share the burden. If an agreement can be reached to achieve that outcome, then certainly Australia wants to be a party to it. We are vigorously and purposefully negotiating to that end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, because of the fact that the cost to Australia is much greater than to most other states in the negotiation, it is difficult to get other parties to adopt the principle of differentiation. They do not need to to achieve an outcome that is satisfactory for their purposes. It is hard to convince a Britain that converted from coal to North Sea gas because it was cheaper that it should be recognised that Australia would be converting from a less expensive fuel to a more expensive fuel to achieve the same outcome. In other words, the sacrifice that Australians would have to bear to achieve the same environmental outcome would be much greater.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to be difficult to convince some parties of this. It is surprising in a way that it is difficult to convince Britain of it, because Britain has been prepared to accept it as a whole for European states&mdash;to allow differentiation between the states. Nevertheless, we are making some progress on that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was pleased last week to have heard the Singaporean environment minister&mdash;I think for the first time&mdash;state that differentiation makes sense and to recognise that it needs to be incorporated to achieve a workable outcome in Kyoto. It is pleasing that the Pacific states, despite the particular critical consequences that they face from global warming, are prepared to recognise the particular burdens that face Australia as well. There are burdens on the Pacific states and there are burdens on Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we can achieve an equitable outcome so that we each share the burden fairly, then Australia wants to be part of that process. We want it to work. So it is not just the developed countries but the developing countries that have to come on board as well. There is no point in pushing an Australian alumina factory offshore and have the greenhouse gas produced elsewhere. The global consequences are the same. Some of these aspects should be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6585"> approached more realistically by the Australian Democrats. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the opposition I would like to take this opportunity to say what we believe the government ought to be doing on the issue of greenhouse gas emissions. It was Labor who committed Australia to participate in an international effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Labor government did argue that the climate change issue was the most significant global environment issue that we faced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1992 Australia became a signatory to the Rio framework convention on climate change. We committed ourselves, along with other developed countries, to the aspirational non-legally binding goal of stabilising greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 as a first step in a process to begin international cooperation. Labor's view is we were right to be involved then and we believe it is right to be involved now as the international community moves towards decisive action on greenhouse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we do believe that the urgency motion that has been proposed by Senator Lees, whilst well-motivated, is oversimplistic. In particular, it gives no attention to issues such as how the international community should deal with specific national circumstances and different industry energy intensity factors, which we have always argued ought to be taken account of in the process. We do share the concern of the Democrats that Australia must commit itself to emission reduction targets and to emission reduction strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has argued and will continue to argue that Australia has specific and legitimate concerns. We argue that those concerns need to be negotiated at Kyoto. For the agreement there to be fair, it has to incorporate measures which deal differentially with specific aspects so that Australia is not unfairly disadvantaged. For example, if Australia were to repatriate downstream processing of our primary production and manufacture efficiently in Australia, then we should not be penalised for such actions. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There would need to be negotiated recognition of such movements by way of greenhouse gas credit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition also believes there is a need to draw in developing countries. It may well be that, whilst the industrialised world must lead on this issue, a comprehensive strategy could involve voluntary and/or lesser commitments by developing countries and a time frame which differs from that that applies to the industrialised world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that overshadowing all this is the science of greenhouse. I have got to say that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and this government really appear to have no idea at all of how to go about articulating the case for Australia. There has been a lot of huffing and puffing from the government on this issue, but the government is yet to tell us what Australia will be taking to Kyoto. We do not know even whether this government will be proposing at Kyoto reductions or increases in gas emissions. The only clear statement on this matter has come from the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer)&mdash;pretty unusual for him, I grant you&mdash;who said that the only acceptable outcome would be one which allowed Australia to increase greenhouse gas emissions. We said that that sort of proposal is entirely unacceptable. Our resolution is clear: we demand an appropriate and a far&hyphen;reaching reduction strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also got the Prime Minister, in the fiasco of his visit to the Pacific islands for the South Pacific Forum, questioning the science on greenhouse. This puts the Prime Minister completely on his own&mdash;absolutely isolated&mdash;amongst international leaders. His position has placed Australia at an all&hyphen;time low in terms of our relations with our neighbours. But, worse, it risks completely isolating Australia in the lead&hyphen;up to Kyoto and this will be of enormous detriment to Australia. For Australia to benefit we need most of all to be in there arguing the case, and we have to be able to argue the case credibly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we have totally lost credibility on a number of fronts&mdash;great credit is due to Senator Hill for that. You have got the Prime Minister desperately trying to have us believe that his efforts in the Pacific islands were a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6586"> great win for Australia, yet if you just have a cursory look at the media reports&mdash;a flick through of what the journalists were saying&mdash;you find unending criticism of the Prime Minister's style and ridicule of his efforts at the forum meeting. The cartoonists have had a field day lampooning John Howard and the way in which he bullied the island states into a position which clearly ignored their concerns, simply to try to save himself from humiliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet Mr Howard had the temerity to tell reporters that he got a very good outcome for Australia and that the outcome recognises the particular problems of the small island states. That is preposterous. That is a porky of extraordinary proportions, even for someone like Mr Howard. It is a complete joke. You only had to see the body language of the leaders from those island states when they emerged from the meeting to work out what they really thought of the outcome, and what they really thought of our weak and sneaky Prime Minister, John Howard. Of course, some of them later put their feelings, in no uncertain terms, into words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me refer to some of the comments in the media. Today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> had this to say in its editorial on Mr Howard's island diplomacy:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's ham&hyphen;fisted diplomacy at the South Pacific Forum got the desired result, but at what cost? By forcing the leaders of poor Pacific nations dependent on Australian aid to soften their calls . . . the Federal Government has created new tensions with these island states. Relations had already been soured in July, after the inept leaking of an Australian intelligence document&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">`Was a compromise possible?', the editorial asks. The editorial continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears the leaders of five small island states were determined to include a call for a mandatory 20 per cent cut in greenhouse emissions in the final South Pacific Forum statement. There is a dispute over whether the 10 other forum participants aside from Australia agreed, however&mdash;Prime Minister John Howard says not. This hints a less heavy&hyphen;handed approach might have sufficed. Australia cannot be suggesting global warming does not matter&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I mentioned the science of greenhouse. Let me contrast that with what the President of the United States has said about this issue and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> his stand on greenhouse. It is worth comparing and contrasting it with Senator Hill's. This is what Mr Clinton said about the science of greenhouse:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overwhelming balance of evidence and scientific opinion is that it is no longer a theory but now a fact that global warming is for real. The world's scientists believe that if we do not cut our emissions of greenhouse gases we will disrupt the global climate. In fact, there is ample evidence that human activities are already disrupting the global climate and that if we stay on our current course the average global temperatures may rise two to six degrees fahrenheit during the next century. To put that in some context, the difference in average temperature between the last ice age, which was 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, and today is about nine degrees fahrenheit. So we could have two&hyphen;thirds of that change in 100 years unless we do something.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">President Clinton went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we fail to act, scientists expect that our seas will rise one to three feet and thousands of square miles here in the US, in Florida, Louisiana and other coastal areas, will be flooded. Infectious diseases will spread to new regions. Severe heat waves will claim lives. Agriculture will suffer. Severe droughts and floods will be more common. There are things that are reasonably predictable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What does Senator Hill say about it in a recent speech?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia recognises the importance of climate change as a major environmental problem which is supported by credible scientific evidence.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What has the Prime Minister said about the same point? This is what he said at the South Pacific Forum:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is nonetheless quite a bit of debate about the science so far as greenhouse effects are concerned and it is not all one way. It is not all&mdash;how should I put it?&mdash;the apocalyptic view of the world and of life.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This government really has diminished our credibility in the international arena. It has diminished our national interests by cutting a number of programs that Labor put in place&mdash;programs that went to significantly reduce emissions through the greenhouse challenge program, that provided a renewable energy industry program and established the Renewable Energy Cooperative Research Centre. With less than 100 days to go before the Kyoto conference the government is attempting to convince the world that we are serious about this problem by announcing now that it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6587"> will implement programs that it had previously cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is preposterous. As far as we are concerned, we demand that the Australian government make a commitment on behalf of this country to emission reduction. We hope that the Democrats will join us in that and not use this opportunity to grandstand on this issue. I accept that we have a lot in common with Senator Lees on this particular issue, but the government ought to reinstate the programs which we in the Labor Party put in place when we were in government and which the coalition government has cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not looking for an excuse or a free ride on this issue. Labor is currently thoroughly reviewing all its policies, and we are developing a concluded view as to how we should respond to any proposal that may emerge from the Kyoto summit which results in legally binding agreements whether differentiated or otherwise. We are very isolated because of Mr Howard's failed leadership on this issue. It is difficult to imagine how it would be in Australia's interest if we are going to be further isolated in Kyoto.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I imagine that Senator Faulkner is greatly relieved that we did not support the moving of that amendment because it actually makes the position the Labor Party is taking quite clear. In terms of what the government is doing or not doing, I want to remind honourable senators that the former government, before their greenhouse package was put forward, looked at it and said, `Whoops! This is only $25 million. What are we going to put in it?' Guess what? Another $25 million went into it, which was a coal subsidy for coal technology. That was the previous government. They may have said better things about greenhouse but they did not do much better. On the international arena they made a few noises but their actions perhaps helped create the situation we have now which is that greenhouse grew at the rate it did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The prospect of the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Howard) arguing that greenhouse science is incorrect, that the mass of scientists trained in atmospheric physics are wrong, and doing so at the conference of Pacific island nations, who will be among the worst affected, leaves one aghast at the unmitigated gall and unparalleled insensitivity. In 1990 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPPC, the working body representing the world's best climate scientists and representing 40 governments, issued a statement that climate change is real and there is no credible uncertainty about the phenomenon or its anthropogenic source&mdash;that is, it is created by humans. International scientific bodies have periodically reinforced this message over the last 7&half; years. There is no credible doubt.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6588">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scientific community and responsible governments will not believe the sincerity of Australia's doubt for a moment. Is this government really claiming that the greenhouse effect is a conspiracy to promote an illusion? It is painfully clear that this government is bent on an attempt to deny reality in pursuit of its desire to shirk responsibility. In the face of over 10 years of information&mdash;10 years of attempting global agreement for action&mdash;successive governments here have done almost nothing to reduce greenhouse emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill mentioned: what about Australia's contribution? If Australia is working in the international fora to undermine agreements, it is not just Australia's greenhouse contributions that are adding to this. It is the undermining of international and regional agreements that is doing even more damage than Australia's growth in its own greenhouse production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Emission levels in Australia have not declined. They have not stabilised. They have, in fact, grown steadily and strongly. At the same time, the energy efficiency as measured by the amount of gross domestic product earned per tonne of greenhouse emission has declined. Let us look at the government's major greenhouse strategy, a voluntary agreement with industry. Even that agreement is not to reduce greenhouse gas; that agreement is to reduce the increase of greenhouse gas. The one major centrepiece of the government's proposal is not even going to reduce greenhouse gas. It does not talk about anything domestically. It does not talk about the rural industry. It does not talk about the level of land clearance. The one voluntary agreement is actually an agreement to increase greenhouse emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environment movement attempted to responsibly put forward ways to reduce energy use without penalising amenity&mdash;things like insulation standards on houses. It is so simple. It does not make people cold in winter or hot in summer. It allows them to be comfortable while reducing their power bills. That is hardly radical. Where are the building codes? Where is the support for retrofitting? It does not exist, and so we waste huge 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amounts of energy for no apparent purpose other than to raise the temperature of the earth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government now has the affront to say we should not have to reduce our emissions because we use a lot of energy. That is like saying Australia should be rewarded for profligacy. What kind of example is that setting the rest of the world? There will be massive costs to the Australian economy in terms of Australian agriculture. Climate change associated with El Nino patterns will affect our fisheries and our forests. That could not have occurred in less than several thousand years by any normal events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already spent billions of dollars in Australia as a result of climate change. It is time we worked positively to see what we can do in the future to amend the situation and to show real leadership in our region and in the world to bring together the forces for positive change. We need to move towards real employment and positive change for dealing with the greenhouse effect.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lees and the Australian Democrats are well-known political opportunists. Her Labor mates are desperate to get back in the headlines. I have to say that the strategy adopted in the chamber this afternoon is novel. I can tell you, jeopardising Australian jobs is not the way to go about promoting yourself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner earlier accused the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of being weak and sneaky. Gareth Evans is the one who is weak and sneaky and as powerful as a pansy on the world stage with his irrelevancy depravation syndrome. Gareth Evans, in this very place in relation to greenhouse gas emissions, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia will not take action which would have net adverse economic impacts nationally or on Australia's trade competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have to say that he has had a strange change of direction in opposition. How can anyone come out in support of legally binding targets to address the reduction of greenhouse emissions when the nature and effect of these targets is unclear? How can we agree on a legally binding target when our country is the fastest growing nation in the OECD and when 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6589"> our regional neighbours are growing and developing at a significant rate and depend on us for food and energy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The market is there for us to provide for. We cannot put a cap on that market now. We cannot say to our industry and primary producers that we can only export a certain amount and that to do otherwise would contravene our legally binding targets. Who will lose in this scenario? I will tell you who. First and foremost, Australians who will be without jobs will lose. Our industries which will be without markets will lose. Australia, because industry will be forced to go offshore to developing countries&mdash;to non&hyphen;annex one countries&mdash;where legally binding restrictions do not exist, will lose. Most importantly, the environment, through carbon leakage, will lose&mdash;the very thing we have set out to protect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lees's motion is about Australia losing on all fronts. The coalition is about providing Australians with jobs, security and economic growth while at the same time protecting the environment. In Kyoto this December we want an outcome which is fair. Legally binding targets are not necessarily fair. Asking this government to sign a blank cheque to the world without having our concerns met is dangerous and irresponsible. While the opposition got used to signing blank cheques and leaving the consequences to others while in government, the Democrats are behaving like Al Grassby. Maybe he was a closet Democrat. Al was a wunderkind of promises in opposition but was not worth a squirt in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government is about responsible government and will not be induced by a reckless backdown to some vague international bottomless pit of lobbyists. We will not risk Australian jobs, we will not risk Australian industry and we will not risk the environment. Legally binding targets could significantly and disproportionately harm the Australian economy compared with our competitors. ABARE assessments in April of this year indicate that, if Australia is forced to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 10 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020, it would impose 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> costs on Australia of $9,000 per person in net present value terms.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We would be expected to sacrifice Australian jobs. How could the senators interjecting on the other side support such a betrayal of the Australian people? Australia's relatively high per capita emissions reflect the structure of our economy and our role as an efficient exporter of energy intensive products. In 1990, 80 per cent of Australia's production of energy and emission intensive goods&mdash;petroleum products, basic metals, minerals and resources, agriculture and food products, meat and dairy products, and chemicals&mdash;were exported. Legally binding targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions would unfairly penalise such domestic industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we seek differential targets, we are taking responsibility in the international arena for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions through exporting our technological advances and through the exporting of environmentally friendly energy and energy technology while bringing down neighbouring countries' emission levels, which, ironically, increase our own levels at the same time. For instance, Australia's liquid natural gas exports will be used by our regional neighbours to replace more polluting energy sources but, because this liquid natural gas production process results in greenhouse gas emissions in Australia, we face a penalty at the national level while the countries which import our product obtain a greenhouse benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legally binding benefits would also affect research and development, which in the long term would reduce gas emissions in a global context but for Australia, again in the production process, would increase emissions. For instance, Ford Australia is investing in a pilot magnesium processing plant in Queensland. It is exploring the option of using magnesium in car components. Again, Australia has a natural endowment in magnesium, which is a lighter metal than aluminium per unit of strength. The bad news is that we may produce more greenhouse gases in this process; the good news, however, is that globally the lightweighting of vehicles is likely to save 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6590"> four times the emissions, for which we will get credit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's global contribution in these circumstances is not recognised under the rules of the convention. If we are tied by legal targets, our efforts to address greenhouse gas emissions globally will be hindered to the detriment of other communities in the world. Why should we be penalised for our emission level when in a global perspective we are in fact playing a significant role in the reduction of emissions? Why do the Democrats ask us to tie the hands of Australians preventing them from achieving for both national and global good?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A fair balance is what is needed. A fair balance is what this government is attempting to achieve in the international arena.

<PARA STYLE="Para">It is a very simple, poignant statement of Australia's obligations to join the rest of the world community in a responsible redress of the mounting global warming problem which threatens the planet's environment, its economy and its social order in the next century. Instead of that, we have both old parties on both sides of this chamber saying they will not vote for it&mdash;a petulant display by the Labor Party, which teamed up with the coal industry during its last years of office to itself go to the world fora and try to pull the rug from under the efforts of more responsible nations to address global warming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party should hang its head in shame for its record and for paving the way for John Howard to swan across to the South Pacific and to do in the interests of the South Pacific nations with that extraordinarily embarrassing and damaging asseveration that the future welfare of whole nations&mdash;small 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nations, albeit in the South Pacific&mdash;was less important to him than a general commitment to the coal industry here in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This codswallop about jobs is really about the big boys in the mining industry who line the election coffers of the big parties year after year. Amongst other things, they have put nearly a million dollars into the ABARE model to try to give specious argument to the faltering faults and irresponsible policies of both parties towards the rest of the world's efforts, as I said, to redress the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have only to look at the more independent think tank, the Australia Institute. Dr Clive Hamilton says that, on estimates taken from European figures, Australia's contribution to future generations' indebtedness from greenhouse gas emissions just last year was $75 billion. That is the indebtedness left on the sideboard for future generations. Talk about jobs! What about this government putting some money into the renewable energy industries where the real jobs are? What about giving some research and development assistance? What about transferring some of the massive amounts of money going into the coal industry and other mining industries across to more responsible future industries where we could proudly export to the rest of the world and create thousands more jobs than those that might be threatened by a change of policy on this important matter?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to the speech given to the United Nations by the President of the Republic of Maldives, His Excellency Mr Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, on 24 June last which really speaks eloquently for the island nations that Australia's Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has cheated in the last few days.

The process may be too gradual to make sensational headlines, but the threat, nevertheless, would be no less real. According to the Inter&hyphen;Governmental Panel on Climate Change, (IPCC), as a result of global warming, sea levels would rise between 30 and 100 centimetres by 2100. 80% of low&hyphen;lying islands, such as those of the Maldives and many in the Pacific Ocean, would be totally submerged.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is disappointing that the Senate is again debating this irresponsible approach by the Democrats. It is an approach that is almost unAustralian. It is an approach that is again knocking Australia and knocking the leadership that Australia has taken in many fields and, in this case, in the important matter of global warming.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see that the Labor Party does understand the problem and does have some interest in the jobs that the Democrats' approach would lose for our country. I would say in response to Senator Faulkner&mdash;I was not able to write down his amendment&mdash;that we would be interested in what the Labor Party would propose at Kyoto. We are somewhat reluctant though to proceed with our proposals publicly at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are interested in the fact, though, that neither the Labor Party nor the minor parties have asked the United States or Japan what their approach is going to be to Kyoto. That is strange when the United States produces some 47 per cent of OECD emissions and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more than one-fifth of the global emissions, and the European Union accounts for some 30 per cent of OECD emissions, whereas Australia has a meagre three per cent of OECD emissions and 1.4 per cent of the global emissions. Yet these minor parties seem to be attacking and criticising Australia without looking at the nations that are producing the majority of greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government agrees that greenhouse gas emissions have to be reduced in Australia. I am very pleased to say that the Antarctic Division and the Bureau of Meteorology&mdash;both elements within the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories for which I have responsibility&mdash;have been doing a lot of leading work on that particular subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The science, of course, is not clear. There are many detractors from the accepted science. I go along with the accepted view, but I do point out that scientists such as Jane Francis, the eminent British scientist of Leeds University, said that the whole issue was to an extent a beat up. There are a number of articles from leading scientists, and I refer to one in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Scientist</EMPHASIS> of 19 July 1997, which throws some doubt on it. I do not agree with that, but then I am not a scientist. I accept the general view, but the science is not clear. There are a number of eminent scientists who disagree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must have pure air and we must look after the people in the world who are entitled to a non&hyphen;polluted atmosphere. That is why the Australian government is doing so much to reduce Australia's greenhouse emissions. We believe that we have to explore alternative power sources. Solar, wind and wave energy sources are just some. I notice that the minor parties often hold Britain up as a great example of a country which is reducing its greenhouse gases. I notice they do not mention, though, that Britain gets a hell of a lot of its power from nuclear power. I wonder whether the minor parties are suggesting that perhaps nuclear power is the way that we should overcome greenhouse gases. I would be very interested to hear their arguments on that because certainly uranium would not produce greenhouse gases.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6592">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot understand why the Democrats and Greens are so unAustralian, so wanting to cost jobs, so wanting to export jobs overseas and, at the same time, exporting the greenhouse gas problem to countries which are not as well equipped to contribute to greenhouse science and emission reductions. I wonder why the minor parties promote the targets that have been talked about without taking into account the `sink' effect that Australia has. The mantra of these overseas countries has been picked up by the carpers, the whingers and the Australian knockers. These people are always knocking Australia&mdash;and the workers that we support, and our standard of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do point out that the science of this whole thing is in no way settled. I had the honour last Monday to attend a conference of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was held in Rockhampton. It was a particularly interesting conference. I do wish that the Greens and the Democrats would attend some of these conferences and get some idea as to the real problems involved. This was a conference of some of the leading scientists around the world. While a lot of it was beyond my technical comprehension, it was very clear to me while I was sitting there listening to it that there is no unanimity at all with the science of emissions and sinks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to say that this conference resolved that science should look not only at emissions but at the net effect of greenhouse gases. That was taken a step forward. What the minor parties and some of the OECD countries look at all the time are the emissions. You do not look at Australia's greater capacity to act as a greenhouse gas sink. You are not interested in the science that is being done to look at just where Australia stands as a sequester of greenhouse gases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, this conference, attended by leading scientists around the world, said that we really had to have another look at the impact on global climate change that our grazing lands have as sinks. It is interesting that, as a result of that conference last week, a recommendation has gone to the Maldives and will eventually get to Kyoto suggesting that really that question has to be looked at more widely. There are parts of the scientific 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> debate which have not yet been considered and which really that question need to be looked at much more closely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill and Senator Heffernan have put the case for the government, and I do not want to repeat that. I simply want to emphasise that there is a lot of good work being done by Australia and by Australian scientists&mdash;the type of work that these sorts of people, the minor parties, should be supporting and encouraging rather than knock, knock, knocking all the time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I wish to take note of the Industry Commission report, primarily because I was reminded this weekend by a somewhat quixotic remark&mdash;if that is the right description&mdash;that the Industry Commission was really a creature of the `Laberals'. What the person who said that meant was that throughout the period in which the Industry Commission has been operating the Labor and Liberal parties&mdash;the `Laberals' as this person referred to them&mdash;had been consistent in their support for the Industry Commission. It was as a result of that consistency that we have seen a series of reports and actions which, by and large, have not been in the interests and to the net public benefit of Australian industry or the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, one thing should always be said about the Industry Commission, and that is that it has consistently been true to itself. In other words, it has followed a coherent and consistent line, even if that has been a line that I disagreed with. In contrast, in recent times the Labor and Liberal parties&mdash;the `Laberals'&mdash;have turned a corner in terms of their decisions on, firstly, the car industry and, secondly, the TCF industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats have welcomed that, but we have been under no illusions as to what that has meant, because primarily it has meant a change in timing and not direction. Until such time as both those parties adopt the doctrine of reciprocity&mdash;which is that you only cut tariffs and non&hyphen;tariff barriers when you have an equivalent agreement bilaterally and multilaterally&mdash;they really are continuing along the lines of Labor's Industry Commission and continuing to support their views. It was disappointing for us to see yet again with the TCF report that economic rationalism and its terribly narrow view that society is there to serve economics continues to prevail. However, I have conceded and will continue to concede that at least the Industry 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commission is consistent and quite determined in the pursuit of that ideological dogma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its recent final report into the car industry, the Industry Commission arrived at similar conclusions and recommendations to those it had reached six months previously. The question in the minds of those who make submissions and have alternative views is: what is the point of continuing to put those submissions and alternative views if little credence is given to them? That, in turn, has drawn the observation that the commissioners and their senior staff are inflexible in terms of being able to present the alternative viewpoint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same occurred with the draft and final reports into the textile, clothing and footwear industries. Such inflexibility is not the only cause for concern. In the car industry report, for example, the commission's economic modelling was used to underpin the claim that consumers would benefit to the tune of $3,700 per vehicle or a total consumer benefit of between $1.7 billion and $4.5 billion a year if suggested tariff reductions were pursued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Modelling which was undertaken later revealed this to be an overestimate, and revision suggested a meagre consumer benefit of $100 million a year. That has been one of the major problems with the TCF and car reports&mdash;and other reports&mdash;in that the modelling itself has been subject to question, and the conclusions on which the ideology has been pinned have been identified as being in error in some respects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question that arises now is whether the government has ignored the Industry Commission. The purpose of my rising to talk is really to say to the Senate and the media&mdash;and I regret that the media have been somewhat superficial, I think, in their reporting on this matter&mdash;that we have to recognise that the government has not ignored the Industry Commission and that, really, it has changed the timing and not the direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen all the articles about how a tariff freeze has been arrived at. But the tariff freeze occurs only in the year 2000. In the meantime, every year, every month and every 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6595"> day, the tariffs continue to fall and, in the TCF sector, factories continue to close and jobs continue to be lost. The media themselves need to start digging a little deeper in terms of assessing the Industry Commission and its reports, and assessing the way in which both the Labor and Liberal parties have dealt with it, because the real question of reciprocity still evades discussion in the media&mdash;that is, we should do only what we are able to negotiate with others to do on both a bilateral and multilateral basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Commentators have claimed that the commission is possibly irrelevant. The two major industry reports have cost taxpayers over a million dollars. Commentators have claimed that the reports have been totally ignored and, on that basis, that their worth must be called into question. However, I regard the Industry Commission reports as being very helpful because they continue to propose, explain and present the economic rationalist view. That provides those of us who are opposed to it with a very useful and continuing counterpoint to argue against.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that the Liberal, Labor and National parties&mdash;and the National Party in particular&mdash;are still fundamentally opposed to visiting and reviewing economic rationalism in a really fundamental way, and to finding an alternative intellectual and theoretical viewpoint which is not merely an adjustment in emphasis but is, in fact, an alternative economic doctrine. I am hopeful that some of the very capable people on either side of the debate will eventually come to deal with that, because deal with that they must.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take the opportunity of the presentation of this report to remind both parties that there is unfinished business out there. The media and the community recognise it, and that is why we still have insecurity, uncertainty and a sense of a lack of direction and leadership. It is only the intellectual alternative which will provide us with the means to defeat what has delivered us, over 20 years, appalling unemployment, appalling debt and the loss of many of our great industries and companies that have been either closed down or sold to foreign interests.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, the end result is that we continue with the unilateral approach, with unilateral reductions and with a situation in which we are making ourselves more and more defenceless in the face of countries and regional agreements in which our competitors continue to maintain exceptionally aggressive industry policies and protection devices for their own industries and jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is profoundly foolish for a country of our size to continue with that policy. For instance, TCF tariffs in developed countries are generally higher than for industrial products overall. Prior to the Uruguay Round, the developed country average bound tariff on textiles and clothing was 15&half; per cent. The USA has an average textile and clothing tariff rate of 14 per cent and a maximum rate of 48 per cent for footwear. The European Union has a maximum rate of 13.4 per cent on textile and clothing products. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been an expectation over time that the Industry Commission produces reports which tend to project the interests of large industries and corporations. We have to understand that these days large corporations are rarely simply based in one country. Even Australia's largest corporations generally have interests overseas, or are controlled or owned to a substantial extent by overseas operators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing is that almost none of the assessments have been very thorough in relation to such things as the impact of free trade. It is a real pity that, this far down the track since the agreements in 1994, we as a country have not done a thorough assessment of the impact of the free trade agreement we signed up to back then. I would love to see a systematic approach&mdash;even in footwear, clothing and textiles&mdash;to look at the impacts on consumers. We cannot just look at the price, although that is important; we have to look at the range and choice that people have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the consumer's point of view, we have also got to look at whether or not the things that they could get before, the kinds of outlets that they could access before, are still able to be accessed. We have also, in my opinion, got to look at such things as whether 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6596"> or not with so&hyphen;called free trade we actually do have a free market in distribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have mentioned on a number of occasions that in the textiles, clothing and footwear industries it matters not a pin that some people are being paid $1 a day or $2 dollars a day to produce, say, a Nike shoe. It matters not a pin if there is a monopoly in distribution and marketing which means that there are huge profits. Those huge profits are not necessarily made in Australia; they might be made elsewhere. It matters that the consumers are not necessarily getting a better deal out of so&hyphen;called free trade and that the consumers are not getting a better deal out of exploiting very low wages in whichever country pays the lowest wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It concerns me greatly that the overall impact of free trade has not been looked at. This includes whether or not people have the ability to buy the goods and services that they need in their daily lives. It should never be forgotten that this is part of the process. It is not just about free trade; it is about free investment policies, and it is almost gloves off, no rules. Once more and more of the companies that have been operating in a country like Australia are swallowed up, then they control the markets. They can actually tell consumers what it is they need and want, because not too many people will be able to stand up against them and offer an alternative. This goes to the very basics of our existence; the very basics of processed food, hardware and many of the goods and services that we use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony here is that we have a so&hyphen;called commitment to free trade, but we do not have a commitment to make sure that that trade really is fair. It seems to me that there has been no real indication whether there is anything at all in the mythical level playing field. Most people, when they look at it carefully, will realise there is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When companies and services are swallowed up it generally leads to a oligopoly, or eventually a monopoly, which means that the consumers are the ones that lose. If it is an oligopoly in distribution&mdash;it often is with the textiles, clothing and footwear industries&mdash;what is the real impact on consumers? I put 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it to you that not only do they not necessarily pay lower prices but also they end up, in my opinion, with fewer choices in types and styles and in those things which are not necessarily moving at the same level as other things are moving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are going down the track of so&hyphen;called international competitiveness, but when that translates to a local market it means that those people who need special fittings in shoes, clothing and so on have few choices. They might have to go further. The little shops that used to be able to service their needs are no longer able to survive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to look&mdash;it is well overdue&mdash;at the impacts of internationalisation and globalisation on Australia. At the very least, we need to look fully and comprehensively at the consumer impact. I would argue that we also need to look at the impact on jobs. We need to look at the overall impact on the cost of living. We need to look at the balance of trade. We also need to look at such things as the environmental impact of free trade. We also need to look at the idea that you can push down the margins on many of those goods and services, and the fact that people have to produce more and more of these goods and services to get the same return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would put to you that that love affair with free trade has never been properly analysed in Australia. The textiles, clothing and footwear industries are screaming examples of the lack of detailed analysis. It is time for government entities to do this. I do not mean entities like the Industry Commission. I think it is time that the government realised we do need to put some effort into this. We are three years down the track. It is well overdue for us to assess Australia's commitment to international free trade and tariff reductions, and also the impact of the changes in access to investment and the ability of companies to take over entire industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether the impacts are on the textiles, clothing and footwear industries or whether they are on other industries, it is time that we looked at those impacts. In the end we could become a country which seems to be simply a quarry or a farm at the expense of our environment. We cannot wait until we get to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6597"> the point of being an arid, dusty, polluted mess and then realise that we have gone the wrong way, because future generations will pay for that in money and in the amenities in their real lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We just had a debate on greenhouse. It seems to me that a lot of the debate on free trade is also about the kinds of options we are giving ourselves, and whether or not we are moving to the point where it seems that there are fewer and fewer choices except dirty and polluting industries and value adding industries serving the basic needs of society. Those basic needs are food, clothing and shelter. If we cannot produce those in Australia, then we ought to be looking very carefully at why not, what we can do about serving the needs of consumers and workers, and the industries producing those basic food, clothing and shelter needs in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT (TRIBUNAL APPOINTMENTS) BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill contains four amendments to the Native Title Act 1993 in relation to the National Native Title Tribunal. The first two amendments concern the qualifications for appointment of the Registrar and presidential members of the Tribunal, the third amendment provides for the temporary appointment of the Registrar by the President of the Tribunal and the fourth amendment provides further clarification of when a member of the Tribunal is considered to have a conflict of interest in relation to an application or inquiry before the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will not have any significant financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The functions and roles of presidential members and the Registrar will change as part of changes to the role of the Tribunal necessitated by the High Court's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Brandy </EMPHASIS> decision. These changes are included in the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997. Under the changes all applications for compensation and native title determinations will be made to the Federal Court and the Court will have sole responsibility for making determinations of native title. The changes mean the main role of the Tribunal will be in the area of mediation of native title claims. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first amendment removes the requirement that the Registrar be admitted to legal practice for 5 years and replaces it with a requirement that a person may not be appointed as Registrar unless the person is legally qualified and has had substantial experience in relation to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander societies; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the law; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">administration; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">any other activities considered relevant to duties of the Registrar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Registrar will no longer have any role in deciding whether or not applications should be accepted, it is appropriate that the qualifications for appointment be changed. This amendment will allow a more diverse field of suitably qualified candidates to be considered for the position of Registrar of the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second amendment concerns presidential members of the Tribunal. Currently, a presidential member has to be a judge of the Federal Court or a former judge of the High Court, Federal Court, Family Court or State or Territory Supreme Court in order to be eligible for appointment. The amendment adds a further class of persons who may be appointed as a presidential member of the Tribunal&mdash;namely, persons who have been admitted to legal practice for at least five years. Again, this amendment ensures that a more diverse field of highly qualified people may be considered for appointment as presidential members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third amendment provides that the President of the Tribunal may appoint an acting Registrar. This will ensure that the Tribunal can quickly and efficiently deal with any temporary vacancy in the position of Registrar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last amendment provides further clarification on when a member of the Tribunal is considered to have a conflict of interest in relation to a particular application before the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment relates to majority recommendation 9 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund in its report on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996. That recommendation considered the possibility of a conflict of interest where members of the Tribunal may be conducting consultancies in native title matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This provision addresses the concerns of the community that members of the Tribunal are impartial, and are seen to be impartial, but is flexible enough to allow people experienced in native title matters to continue to be appointed to the NNTT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6599">  </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill implements a number of the Government's important policy initiatives within the Immigration and Multicultural Affairs portfolio, particularly in relation to merits review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures contained within the bill are consistent with the Government's commitments to improve the immigration decision&hyphen;making system and continue the process of restoring community credibility in the management of immigration matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 20 March this year, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs announced a range of significant changes the Government would make to refugee and immigration decision&hyphen;making and review systems. These changes will improve the efficiency, credibility and accountability of immigration decision&hyphen;making.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One major change is the streamlining of the current two tier review process of non&hyphen;refugee visa decisions into a single review by an independent review agency. The bill gives effect to this by merging existing internal review undertaken by the Migration Internal Review Office of the Department Immigration and Multicultural Affairs with the external merits review carried out by the Immigration Review Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the changes introduced by this bill, the single tier review will be conducted by a new external review body, the Migration Review Tribunal. Review of non&hyphen;refugee decisions by the Migration Review Tribunal will commence on 1 July 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Migration Review Tribunal will be required to conduct fair, impartial and expeditious review of migration decisions, at lower cost to the Australian taxpayer. This will be achieved through the introduction of more streamlined and flexible review decision&hyphen;making processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Tribunal's Principal Member will have clear authority to apply efficient processing practices. This may include the introduction of a case management system where much of the preliminary research and investigative work would be undertaken by administrative staff of the Tribunal. Tribunal members would be responsible for directing that any further investigation be undertaken, and for the final decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Migration Review Tribunal members will be independent decision&hyphen;makers, able to reach their own conclusions on a decision under review, in accordance with the law. However, this independence does not amount to non&hyphen;accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members will be accountable, on matters of procedure, to the Parliament through the Principal Member for ensuring that they conduct reviews, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fairly and expeditiously. The bill will give the Migration Review Tribunal's Principal Member power to make directions on the efficient conduct of reviews. These directions only relate to review procedures. The Principal Member can not make directions on policy issues related to the merits of a case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of ensuring efficient conduct of reviews, the Principal Member will be able to reconstitute the Tribunal provided specific preconditions are satisfied. Reconstitution may only occur where, following consultation with the member constituting the Tribunal and a Senior Member of the Tribunal, either:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Principal Member is satisfied that there is insufficient material before the Tribunal for it to decide the review; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the prescribed time has elapsed since the case was constituted to that member.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These preconditions emphasise that reconstitution is solely for ensuring efficient and timely reviews and safeguard against misuse of the power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes will set the framework for significant reductions in both the time and costs of review of general migration visa decisions. However, I should stress that the bill will not alter the entitlements of persons to seek review of decisions by the Department refusing or cancelling visas. Those persons who are currently able to seek review of particular decisions by the Migration Internal Review Office or the Immigration Review Tribunal will be able to seek independent review of those decisions by the Migration Review Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Principal Member of the Refugee Review Tribunal will be provided with the same authority to apply efficient processing practices as those of the Principal Member of the Migration Review Tribunal. This includes clear authority to give directions on the operation of the Refugee Review Tribunal and the efficient conduct of reviews.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions allowing the Minister to appoint persons to act in a senior office of the Refugee Review Tribunal for periods of up to 12 months will be brought into line with the equivalent provision which currently exists for the Immigration Review Tribunal and that proposed for the Migration Review Tribunal. This will allow the Minister to appoint members to act as Senior members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also includes certain safeguards for applicants by introducing a code of procedure for both the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal which is similar to that already applying to decisions made by the Department. This code includes such matters as the giving of a prescribed notice of the timing for a hearing, and a requirement that applicants be given access, and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6600"> time to comment, on adverse material relevant to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the bill contains a number of measures to allow for more flexible processes in both Tribunals. These include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">enabling the Tribunals to use telephone or other media to conduct personal hearings or to require other witnesses to appear before them; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">allowing Tribunals to proceed to a decision without delay, if an applicant does not respond to a notice to attend a hearing or provide comment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taken together, these changes mean that people with bona fide review applications will be given a decision more quickly and a better decision if the initial decision is wrong. Those persons intent on fraud, deception or delay will not have the benefits of a delayed decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes are consistent with foreshadowed Government moves to introduce further reform of merits review tribunals across all portfolios by consolidating all tribunals into one, new Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill includes a number of other changes. These relate to measures to enhance the visa cancellation powers, including:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the power to ensure that there is more effective cancellation of visas which were granted on the basis of incorrect information, for example, where a previous visa was granted on the basis of incorrect information; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the tightening of certain notice provisions which are integral to the visa cancellation process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One further measure which is consistent with other proposals in this bill to improve flexibility in migration processes, is the introduction of a waiver of the condition which is placed on certain visas to prevent the visa holder from being granted a further visa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to citizenship, legislative changes to implement strengthened deprivation provisions came into effect earlier this year. However, these changes meant that the penalty provisions in the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 were not in line with general Commonwealth policy. The proposed amendments rectify this anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I would like to emphasize the fact that this bill is part of a continuing process adopted by this Government to ensure that the integrity of the migration program is not undermined as well as the strengthening of those controls over who can be granted, or continue to hold, Australian visas. This Government will be introducing further legislation in this area later this year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R86">Trans&hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill 1996</XREF>  has been discussed and there has been much good debate about it, but there are two issues which I would like to raise. They perhaps do not go to the essential substance of the bill, but in my view they are of considerable importance. If the minister had the mind to do so, I would be interested in his comments on these two matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first issue is how parliaments of the various states and territories, of the Commonwealth and of New Zealand could have an input into this matter. The issue is perhaps best explained by reading some passages from the explanatory memorandum to the bill. The explanatory memorandum says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Arrangement was signed by all Australian Heads of Government at the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments held on 14 June 1996. The Arrangement was subsequently signed by the Prime Minister of New Zealand on 9 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What has been pointed out there is that the heads of the various governments all had an input into this bill. The next paragraph of the explanatory memorandum goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parties to the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Arrangement have agreed to submit to their respective Parliaments legislation implementing the Arrangement, and to use their best endeavours to secure the passage and bringing into force of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6601"> legislation by early 1997. The participating parties to the Arrangement will be those which have secured the passage or the making of legislation implementing the Arrangement and caused that legislation to come into force and remain in force.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am not sure what has happened with that particular proposition, but I would be interested to see to what extent the various parliaments around the country have had an effective ability to do something about this legislation. The third paragraph I want to read perhaps goes towards explaining that question, but I am not sure whether it does fully. The paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To come into effect, the trans-Tasman mutual recognition scheme requires at least one State to enact legislation referring or requesting the enactment of a Mutual Recognition Act to the Parliament of the Commonwealth. The Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition (New South Wales) Bill 1996, introduced into the Parliament of New South Wales on 30 October 1996, refers to the Parliament of the Commonwealth under paragraph (xxxvii) of section 51 of the Commonwealth Constitution the power to enact an Act in the terms, or substantially in the terms, set out in the schedule to that Bill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is clear that there is an attempt to give the parliaments some say in this, but I just wonder how much say they have and how effective it has been. It is going to be the sort of issue that becomes more and more important as our relationship with the country of New Zealand becomes closer and closer. In fact, the constitution of the British parliament makes it clear how close they thought New Zealand was coming to Australia, because clause 6 of that bill&mdash;clause 9 setting out the constitution itself&mdash;says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Commonwealth" shall mean the Commonwealth of Australia as established under this Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The States" shall mean such of the colonies of New South Wales, New Zealand, Queensland, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia, and South Australia, including the northern territory of South Australia, as for the time being are parts of the Commonwealth, and such colonies or territories as may be admitted into or established by the Commonwealth as States; and each of such parts of the Commonwealth shall be called "a State."</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was saying before the dinner break that the relationship between Australia and New Zealand is very close and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has always been very close. It was seen to be so even at the time of Federation, although New Zealand did not join the other colonies that were contemplated by the Imperial Act as entities that might join a federation. Nevertheless, a close relationship has been maintained. It is clear that the relationship between the two countries is becoming closer and closer, and that is a good thing. However, they are two separate national states and the relationship between the two should be developed in a sensible and proper fashion, suiting the interests not only of the governments and parliaments of those countries but also of the various people who live in them. The Australian states and territories have a responsibility to their citizens, particularly in regulating the provision of goods and services. A state's prime responsibility is to its own citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue I wanted to raise was that of privacy. Other speakers in this debate have already addressed this matter. Privacy is an issue that we have to wrestle with. Very early in the life of this government, the Attorney&hyphen;General, Daryl Williams, indicated that he had a plan to see that proper privacy provisions were brought into operation in Australia in respect of matters not only to do with government but also to do with the private sector and other sectors of the community. That initiative has, at least for the while, gone on the backburner, but it is a matter that should be kept in the minds of all legislators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to see that this issue is raised in the bill which is now before the chamber, the Trans&hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill 1996 . We have heard already in the debate that in New Zealand the provisions for the protection of the privacy of its citizens are different from, and perhaps more rigorous and effective than, such provisions in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People are entitled to privacy in respect of those matters that are properly theirs, that they properly own. The way in which people go about their private lives, what they do in their homes and, indeed, what they do in their business are matters that should attract privacy laws because they are matters that are in the proper possession of the people concerned. Those aspects of life should be intruded upon only for very powerful reasons, such 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6602"> as the investigation of serious crime. When privacy is breached in that way, it should be breached only under the terms of a properly issued warrant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the proposition is that privacy should be increasingly stripped away from people, that people have nothing to hide, then everything should be opened up. Either everybody has privacy or nobody has privacy. If the lives of private citizens are going to be made public, the affairs of government and government departments and of businesses, whether private or public, should be made public. In any event, that is digressing a bit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation sets out the principles of privacy and contains particular provisions to protect privacy in accordance with those principles. I am interested to know whether there are any means by which those matters set out in schedule 5 can be enforced or whether they are simply a statement of what the Commonwealth considers important. In other words, are there any sanctions by which the matters set out there can be enforced or protected?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are the two issues that I wished to raise. Firstly, in this new scheme of things, where all the states and territories of Australia and New Zealand are to come to an agreement about the way goods and services are to be handled across the Tasman, how can these provisions be properly scrutinised by all the parliaments? Secondly, there is the issue of privacy. I would find it very helpful if the minister could explain these matters in his usual lucid way, either in his reply or during the committee stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief in my response to the contribution made by opposition senators and senators from the Democrats and the Greens on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R86">Trans&hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill 1996</XREF> . In relation to Senator Cook's query as to what the government would be doing with respect to each item of legislation mentioned in his amendment, the government will be agreeing to the amendment proposed by Senator Cook. I think that answers his question in relation to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the question of privacy raised by Senator Cooney and Senator Stott Despoja, the government would point to schedule 5 of the bill, as mentioned by Senator Cooney. That sets out the principles to be applied in looking after the information that is supplied. That relates to information received from the New Zealand side of the equation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for information which is given from the Australian side, that is protected under clause 38 of the bill. Clause 38 says that the law of the jurisdiction where the information is received protects that information. So any Australian details, if you like, that are supplied to New Zealand would receive the protection of the New Zealand legislation. In turn, any information received from New Zealand would have the principles as mentioned in schedule 5. I think that spells out how the question of privacy works in relation to this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cooney also asked what has been done by the respective parliaments to implement this legislation. As I understand it, the New South Wales parliament by its legislation has referred to the Commonwealth the ability to pass this legislation. That is pursuant to section 51(xxxvii) of the constitution. I understand the ACT has recently passed legislation in the same way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the remaining states and the Northern Territory, I understand that they are taking the course that, once the Commonwealth legislation is passed, they will adopt the Commonwealth legislation. So the states have a choice: either they refer a power to the Commonwealth for the Commonwealth to pass the legislation or they wait for the Commonwealth to pass the legislation and then they adopt it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to other matters raised, the government rejects that this bill would diminish the rights of consumers and the protection for consumers. I point to the fact that just recently the government has banned the sale of disposable and cheap refillable cigarette lighters. There was a safety problem in relation to this. I think in this exercise you can see how a temporary exemption would operate under this bill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6603">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened there was that the import of non-complying disposable lighters was banned from 1 March this year and their sale was banned from 1 October this year. The scenario mirrors the proposed new administrative arrangements which would mean that products banned under the Trade Practices Act would automatically be banned from import under the customs prohibited imports regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This temporary exemption which is mentioned does mean that products which are unsafe could be exempted from the operation of this arrangement. Indeed, in Senator Cook's amendment you can see that very wide coverage has been included&mdash;the Sale of Hazardous Goods Act, the Consumer Affairs and Fair Trading Act, the Trade Standards Act, the Fair Trading Act and the Consumer Affairs Act. Senator Cook really has included a very wide ambit in his amendment. I would say that that amendment goes to meeting the concerns that have been raised in relation to product safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to food and food standards, the Australia New Zealand Food Authority is embarking upon uniform hygiene    standards throughout Australia and New Zealand. I think this is a highly desirable result. In the most important way, food safety is already being addressed. The target is that, over the next couple of years, we will have uniform standards between New Zealand and Australia in any event and that would go to labelling as well. So from the food side of things that question of safety is being addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the temporary exemption, the matter goes to the ministerial council concerned which deals with this. As a result of any exemption, the question of harmonisation of standards is then addressed. So the temporary exemption raises the matter and then the ministerial council concerned irons out a harmonisation of standards. I think that addresses the matter. Unfortunately, time does not permit me to go into further detail, but I say that the amendments as foreshadowed by the Greens and the Democrats cannot be supported by the government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although I addressed a couple of these issues by way of interjection, I think it would be worth while if I put on the record the scenario I outlined in my speech during the second reading debate. I have to say that the scenario is not specifically related to my amendment to delete paragraph (b), and it is not a particularly fulsome argument against paragraph (b). In my speech, I said: consider the scenario when, or if, New Zealand forms a similar agreement with another country. There are other countries with which New Zealand has close ties. What is to stop New Zealand forming a mutual recognition agreement with Fiji? What is to stop New Zealand forming a mutual recognition agreement with Tonga? The point is that once we have signed a mutual recognition agreement with New Zealand, that means that there could be a situation in the future where we do have a sort of lowest common denominator coming through, from whichever country has the lowest standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been prepared in this chamber to sit up and accept&mdash;it seems&mdash;a situation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6605"> where Australia is prepared to take different standards and New Zealand, to a lesser extent, is prepared to take different standards. They have been a bit smarter than Australia. We have been prepared to take the bad end of things. But if we have been prepared to do so, we can do nothing. Australia cannot stop New Zealand entering into another arrangement with another country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You may well say that is in the future, but this is the kind of issue we ought to be considering now, before we go blindly into an agreement like this which, in fact, is saying `Your standards are our standards'. Then, if they have a similar agreement with another country, maybe in the end it will be discriminatory if you do not have an agreement like this. Maybe we all are moving&mdash;that is what we are arguing&mdash;with the new world trade regime into a lowest common denominator standard regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The runs are already on the board. We already know that Australia has had to lower its own standards under the World Trade Organisation. This is not a fanciful scenario. We know it has happened already. For example, there have been all sorts of changes or differences to radiation levels. We know about the salmon. We know about the imported chicken meat. We know there are things we have had to accept through the so-called free trade regime which we would not have had to do otherwise. All I am saying is: be warned. Go into this with your eyes open instead of pretending it is just a fanciful scenario that might or might not happen in the future. This is happening already in various ways. We are walking into this as if we do not know anything about what has happened already.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular amendment is about goods satisfying the standards of one country. Why should we pick out labelling and date stamping? Why should we? What was the good reason why Australia accepted use by dates? Why should other standards that might be different or lower than Australia's be acceptable? Why did we choose that standard in the first place or is that now totally irrelevant? That is what is in question in this particular amendment. </PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">First of all, the first amendment omits paragraph (a) of clause 11, which contains requirements for goods that do not need to be complied with such as standards for the `production, composition, quality or performance'. This arguably includes product safety standards, which are set out in the Trade Practices Act. The Democrats and I think it is essential to remove this paragraph.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 10 of this bill is the operative provision while clause 11 adds further requirements. These requirements should not include standards with the effect of ignoring goods standards about safety, production, composition, quality or performance, et cetera. Excluding paragraph (a) will not change the effectiveness of the operative clauses of this bill but will require those laws which are to be repealed by the operation of this bill to be identified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have actually sought from the government, in particular from Minister Moore, a list of all the laws which are affected by this particular paragraph. I have been informed that there is no such list and that there is no certainty as to which laws will be overwritten by this particular paragraph. So, to get around this problem, I have proposed an amendment to clause 12 which would maintain the goods model proposed by the bill. Clause 12 sets out criteria that need to be complied with unless specifically excluded from the operation of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the Australian standards are a minimum requirement. Any goods that meet this lower standard will not be affected by this particular amendment. However, this amendment will make sure that all those laws which are affected by this provision which have not been identified will not be done away with. I have undertaken a cursory review of the Commonwealth laws that will be affected and the amendments proposed by both the Democrats and the Greens show that there are laws which would have been overridden by this bill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6610">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 2, if I may address that now, adds a new subclause to clause 12 which excludes the production, composition, quality or performance of goods from the operation of the TTMR principle. This maintains the goods model proposed by requiring goods to comply with Australian standards about safety, production, composition, quality or performance, et cetera, as those laws relate to health, safety and environmental pollution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have set out before the reasons I believe this clause is essential, and I did so mainly in my second reading address. I do not believe it will alter significantly the goods model proposed by the bill. I say again that, unless this provision is included, a range of unidentified laws will be overridden by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Trade Practices Act amendment that I propose proves that there are laws which should have been maintained but would have been lost. I do not accept that this Senate would consider it appropriate to introduce legislation that will have unknown and mostly unwarranted effects. To make sure this does not happen, I urge all senators to support the amendments I have moved, particularly this one which recognises that it does not alter significantly the effect of the goods model that is set out in this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

The words `consumer product safety standards' are used in the Trade Practices Act, and they refer very specifically to prescribed standards. This is not an open class, rather a specifically defined set of standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Adding this provision may require the unanimous agreement of the heads of government of the participating parties; that is, states, territories, the Commonwealth and New Zealand. This is unfortunate but, given the important nature of consumer protection, the specific Trade Practices Act scheme addressed product safety and the executive nature of the agreement. I think, specifically, our government should have thought about this before, together with those other participating parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This delays the introduction of the scheme. I should point out that the agreement is already eight months late. As I understand, it was supposed to happen by 1 January this year. I believe that consumer protection is so important that this should have been considered much earlier. I have to concur with Senator Margetts's comments in relation to the alleged initial non-controversial nature of this piece of legislation. We were gravely concerned when we heard that it was listed as non-controversial and that that status had not been challenged by anyone else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, as I mentioned earlier, the Senate is not here to rubber&hyphen;stamp executive agreements. Our task is to make sure that good legislation is implemented, and I would doubt the government will get that level of support from consumers if they are going to propose 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a scheme that undermines basic consumer protection. So, without this particular measure, consumers will be exposed to unsafe products which cause harm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 4 adds to the Trade Practices Act the `consumer product safety standards', which should be excluded from the operation of the bill. Again, I have set out the arguments before, and I reiterate that I really do doubt the level of support that this government would get from consumers if they persevere with legislation that undermines these basic and important consumer protections and standards.

For the Commonwealth, it is of course the Trade Practices Act and the relevant division of that act. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the states, it is the Fair Trading Act of New South Wales, the Consumer Affairs Act of Victoria, the Fair Trading Act of Queensland, the Trade Standards Act of South Australia, the Consumer Affairs Act of Western Australia, the Fair Trading Act of Western Australia, the Goods (Trade Descriptions) Act of Tasmania, the Sale of Hazardous Goods Act of Tasmania, the Consumer Affairs and Fair Trading Act of the Northern Territory and the Consumer Affairs Act of the Australian Capital Territory. This amendment refers to the relevant sections of each of those acts as exempt from the provisions of this bill, once it is proclaimed as an act. That exemption will apply for a period of 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Upon the conclusion of that period, it may be extended by the ministerial council, or it may not. It depends on what developments have occurred during that period to resolve the issues that have been referred to in this debate. I think it covers many of the concerns that have been fairly expressed as to the basic concern from the Greens and the Democrats as well. It does it differently from the way in which they have proceeded but I think, on balance, this is the preferred way and the one certainly which the opposition chooses to move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts did, in an intervention earlier this evening, draw attention to the fact that there was a need for this debate. I do not dispute that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do have, as foreshadowed in my speech in the second reading debate, a question for you, Minister. It is my understanding that in part you answered this question in your reply to the second reading debate.

Will the government notify the parliament close to the end of that year&mdash;about a year hence&mdash;as to what the ministerial council proposes to do with each of these bills? If you could, preferably, indicate that the government is disposed to advise 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6613"> the parliament&mdash;so that the decision is not something that is captured just within the executives of governments at the Commonwealth, state and territory level and at the New Zealand government level but is shared with the parliament&mdash;that would enable us to maintain contact with the way in which these issues have been pursued and, I think, to test some of the concerns that have been put in this debate against the way in which those charged with the responsibility handle them and bring them to a conclusion. My question is: will the government notify the parliament as to the outcome of the issues prior to the expiration of the 12&hyphen;month period.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP has included, in the specific acts covered by schedule 3, division 1A of part V of the Trade Practices Act and equivalent state and territory acts. This covers clauses 65B to 65T on product safety and product information standards, including recall and product safety information clause 65D.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting the Labor Party amendment, not because we think it is an entirely satisfactory amendment but because we believe that it is a last gasp for consumer product standards in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to address some of the concerns that we have with the Labor Party amendment. I note that it sets out a number of laws as special exemptions in schedule 3. We acknowledge that this is a significant advance on what the bill proposed, because it does at least recognise the importance of consumer product safety standards. Again, I acknowledge and welcome the government's acceptance of this amendment, and I do so because it is an acknowledgment by the government that the bill has failed to recognise the importance to Australians of some laws which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6614"> protect consumers from unsafe products. That is the only way that we can read the government's acceptance of this particular amendment&mdash;that they acknowledge that this bill had serious shortcomings, especially in relation to product safety standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned because I think this represents a poor response from the party that introduced the very good product safety standards and that particular scheme that is in the Trade Practices Act. This amendment falls short of a proper recognition of the product safety standards and general consumer protection laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that this amendment will maintain the protection set out in the Trade Practices Act, because it will place consumer safety standards under ongoing, regulatory protection every 12 months and under the view of other governments. If the intention is to maintain these measures until the Trade Practices Act and other acts are repealed or amended, then those laws should be permanently exempted. A rolling special exemption is the sort of measure that leads to laws being undermined and subjected to repeal by powers outside this parliament. This is the central concern that the Australian Democrats have with the bill as it stands, but we also do not believe that this amendment effectively addresses those concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think that the Labor Party should be very proud of their consumer protection laws and should not allow them to be dismantled in this manner. The only solution is a permanent exemption as was set out in the amendments moved by the Democrats. If the intention is to dismantle these laws, then the laws themselves should be amended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to briefly outline how the special exemption provisions operate and why we believe that this amendment is a poor compromise. Clause 48 of the bill makes provision for a special exemption for Australian laws set out in schedule 3. This exemption lasts for 12 months from the commencement of this bill. The government may then extend that period for further periods of up to 12 months, with two&hyphen;thirds support from the states and New Zealand and if the previous regulation has not expired.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a saving provision for matters relating to an exemption where that exemption has expired or ceased to be in force. This in effect means that a law exempted in schedule 3 must be identified each year by regulation for ongoing exemption. This regulation will need to be made or the exemption will expire; it will no longer have effect and the regulation will require the support of two&hyphen;thirds of participating jurisdictions. Even if there is a rolling special exemption every 12 months into the future, this can become an exclusion or permanent exemption only by regulation and the endorsement of all participating jurisdictions. I understand that New Zealand is unlikely to agree to this regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision in clause 45(5) will not apply to this measure, as that provision requires the laws set out in schedule 5 and will not take effect for five years after the commencement of clause 48. This means that section 65C of the Trade Practices Act will retain its current operation only if there is a yearly regulation for a special exemption to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I received a letter, dated 3 September, from the minister, in relation to the Labor Party's amendment. Senator Ellison stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that a special exemption for trade practices legislation would resolve your concerns in this area. It would remove the need to rely on the government to make a regulation invoking a temporary exemption after the bill had been passed. The TPA and related legislation would continue to be a special exemption until the parties had agreed to harmonise standards or, where such an agreement could not be reached, that certain products should become permanent exemptions. At that time, there would be a requirement for the government to make a regulation to remove the TPA from the special exemption schedule. Such a regulation would be subjected to review by parliament.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Democrats were not entirely sure as to what you meant by these words, Minister, because we set out why we believe a permanent exemption is an unlikely solution. We have said all along that a temporary exemption was never a solution, so this leaves the agreement to harmonise standards. This is not a solution. As we say, the product safety scheme should remain intact and should not be dismantled. The harmonising process will place this scheme on the table for negotiation, which has been our concern from the very 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6615"> beginning. This is not a negotiable scheme. We have made that plain all along, including in our amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For these reasons, the Democrats do not believe that the Labor Party amendment is satisfactory. All we can do is ask the government to provide an assurance to the Senate that it will introduce regulations every 12 months, and that it will not harmonise away the consumer product safety scheme. Of course, we ask the opposition to give the same assurance. I will give you the assurance of the Australian Democrats that, when we are in government, we will ensure that consumer product safety is maintained&mdash;the point being that I seek from the minister an assurance, today, in this place, that he will not whittle or harmonise away the very good and very important product safety standards and laws that we have had in this country, which were introduced by the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be supporting the amendment. We see this as a last resort, given that the Greens and the Australian Democrats amendments were not passed. We believe it is necessary as a last gasp of consumer product standard protection, but we think it has significant flaws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to end by providing to the Senate an example of why consumer product safety standards must be maintained. Some of you may know that, last week, the ACCC instituted civil proceedings in the Federal Court against a supplier and retailer of hydraulic jacks which did not meet Australia's mandatory consumer product safety standards. The ACCC alleged that the jack was insufficient to withstand the claimed load, and that there was insufficient labelling or instructions. The ACCC alleged serious safety concerns and sought a recall of this particular product. With the amendments proposed, there will be no guarantee that Australian consumers will be protected from these dangerous goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said on behalf of the Democrats, this bill makes this safety issue negotiable, and it is unlikely that the consumer product safety scheme will ever be permanently exempt from the Trans&hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Agreement.</PARA>

If you think that that is strange, it is in fact the norm. Therefore, if you think, `They only meet once a year; they don't do much,' you are quite wrong.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I was not suggesting&mdash;and I am certainly not that brave person you referred to who was&mdash;that harmonisation in itself is a bad thing. I recognise, however, that harmonisation or standardisation of laws does have potentially negative consequences if you are talking about potentially inequitable outcomes or standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats, as I have stated for the record a number of times, are committed to the mutual recognition principle. There is absolutely no suggestion that we are opposing that per se. We see the potential for great, positive and progressive things as a result of mutual recognition principles. Indeed, in other parliaments in this country we have supported this concept. However, we do get very concerned when this concept is used to whittle away, reduce or weaken in some way particular laws and standards. I think, as Senator Margetts has rightly commented, when it comes to consumer product safety standards we are looking at being on the losing end of the deal here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are reducing, as a consequence of this particular bill, the standards that we have in this country. I have commended those standards and commended the former government for introducing those particular consumer product safety standards in the Trade Practices Act. That is why I have made a plea and requested an assurance from this government that they will not harmonise away those standards. Certainly there is the potential for that to happen, as it is indeed already happening in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the minister would be reluctant to acknowledge that his acceptance of this amendment shows that his bill has some deficiencies. I am probably a little naive to suggest, Senator Ellison, that you stand up and say that it does. But certainly that is the only way that the Australian Democrats can read it. I am curious as to why you would accept the Labor Party amendment if you thought that the bill was sufficient without that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return to an earlier comment in relation to privacy and privacy laws in this country. I took on board your comments, Senator Ellison, in relation to section 38 of the bill in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6617"> relation to receipt of information. You said to me that privacy was protected or commented on or addressed in this particular bill in section 38. I say to you that the arguments that you used in this chamber actually support the argument that I put forward, that is, that it has to be included in section 38 of this bill because the current laws in Australia are inadequate for the purposes of dealing with a country like New Zealand. That is why it has been included.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course we have to do something about protecting the receipt of information. It would be okay for us when sending information that is received in New Zealand; their information would be protected under their laws, under their privacy arrangements. But information received in Australia&mdash;that is, New Zealanders sending some kind of information to Australia&mdash;is not protected because our privacy laws in this country are blatantly inadequate. That is why that section has been included in the bill. So I suggest, Minister, that your comments earlier in this debate in relation to the inclusion of privacy and receipt of information in this bill simply bear out the Democrat claims in relation to privacy laws in this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R216">Telecommunications (Interception) and Listening Device Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  has two primary purposes. These purposes are, firstly, to allow telecommunications interception information to be provided to the newly established New South Wales Police Integrity Commission and, secondly, to permit deputy presidents and senior members of the AAT to issue telecommunications interception warrants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will start with the provisions of the bill which relate to the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission. The commission has been established by the New South Wales government as a permanent authority to continue the anti-corruption work undertaken by the highly successful Wood royal commission into that state's police services. It goes without saying that the commission&mdash;the establishment of which was recommended by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6618"> Commissioner Wood&mdash;is essential to the maintenance of public confidence in and discipline within the New South Wales police force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party wholeheartedly supports the availability of telecommunications intercept material to this particular body. The provision of that information to the PIC will serve as an invaluable tool in the fight against corruption in that state. Any suggestions that have been made to the contrary by both the federal government and members of the Liberal Party  in New South Wales are totally unfounded and scandalous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I turn to the issue of who should have the power to issue telecommunications interception warrants, that is a different matter altogether and it raises a matter of grave concern not just to the Labor Party but to a broad spread of members of our community. These provisions proposed by the government would allow deputy presidents and senior members of the AAT to issue telecommunications intercept warrants. Traditionally, telecommunications intercept warrants have only been issued by persons who are judicial officers. That is the current state of the law as it is reflected in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979, the Australian Federal Police Act 1979, the Customs Act 1901 and the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to place on the record why judicial officers have traditionally performed this function. This was recognised by the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) himself in an answer he gave to the House of Representatives just a few weeks ago, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Interception through the use of telecommunications devices is very intrusive, and on both sides of the House there has been support in the past for these warrants being given out sparingly. It has been common that they should be given by federal judges&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The use of telecommunications interception warrants is a very highly invasive technique that, if abused, would threaten the privacy of all Australians. Australians therefore are entitled to expect that, when they engage in their day-to-day telephone or Internet conversations with their friends, relatives or business acquaintances, these conversations would not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ordinarily be listened to by third parties, including law enforcement agencies, without some good cause. It should only be when law enforcement agencies can justify the need to intercept or to listen to a particular conversation or transmission for the purpose of investigating specified criminal offences, whether actually undertaken or still in contemplation, that the authority should have the right to breach the right of privacy which should otherwise be enjoyed by all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this context, it is appropriate that law enforcement agencies should only be allowed to issue intercept warrants over our private conversations when they have proven the need to do so before an independent, impartial arbiter who is skilled particularly in the criminal investigation process. It was in this context that the original decision was taken on a bipartisan basis, as acknowledged by Mr Williams, for judges only to carry out this task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note at this juncture that judicial officers do not carry out this function as part of their responsibilities in exercising the judicial power of the Commonwealth. The issuing of telecommunications interception warrants was held by the 1985 High Court case of Hilton v. Wells to be an exercise of executive power which, under the relevant statutes, is vested in a person who happens to be a judicial officer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following that decision, the Hawke Labor government amended the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 to provide that the judge must expressly consent to perform the function before he or she may be nominated by the Attorney-General. So a judicial officer may refuse to be vested with the power to issue telecommunications interception warrants if he or she wishes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Judicial officers have been traditionally selected to perform this task because, as individuals, they possess certain skills as a result of having this judicial experience. Examples of such skills include exhibiting neutrality, detachment and disinterestedness; and experience in receiving evidence, assessing its credibility, evaluating submissions upon it and reaching conclusions comfortable 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6619"> with the law which are expressed with efficiency and promptness in a stated conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It could be argued, as it has been by the government in seeking current amendments, that deputy presidents and senior members of the AAT also possess these skills. The Attorney has noted that, to be appointed to each of these positions, a person must, firstly, have been enrolled as a legal practitioner of the High Court, another Federal Court or the Supreme Court of a state or territory and, secondly, been so enrolled for a period of not less than five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say at this point that there is no dispute between the government and the Labor Party that deputy presidents and senior members of the AAT do exercise these skills in the performance of their admin law related duties. However, despite their considerable skills in the area of admin law, most deputy presidents and senior members of the tribunal lack formal judicial experience. In particular, they lack experience of the criminal jurisdiction essential to the performance of the power to issue telecommunications interception warrants. This experience is not one that can be gained solely through the issuing of telecommunications interception warrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To understand the use of these warrants and their effect on the criminal investigative process, it is important for the decision maker to have some experience of the effect of the use of the interception or listening devices on the prosecution of offenders. Only persons such as judges, who may ultimately hear matters in which telecommunications interception or listening devices are used or in which the product of such a device is used, have the requisite experience. As I have noted previously and often, this cannot generally be said of deputy presidents and senior members of the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said a little earlier, this is not a criticism of such people, of the deputy presidents and senior members of the AAT. Rather it is an acknowledgment that their expertise lies in another area. As I also said earlier, Labor is not the only organisation which is concerned about this issue. For example, in a letter sent to both me and the Attorney-General on 22 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> July, the President of the New South Wales Law Society, Mr Patrick Fair, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the necessity of ensuring that appropriate safeguards of privacy are maintained, along with the integrity of innocent conversations transmitted by telephone, the Law Society has long expressed the view that any warrant to intercept these communications should only be granted by a judicial officer. Accordingly, the Criminal Law Committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">of the Law Society&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">does not support the devolution of the power to issue telephone interception warrants to members of the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Attorney, in his second reading speech, advanced two reasons for wanting to allow deputy presidents and senior members of the AAT to exercise the power to issue telecommunications interception warrants. The Attorney noted in that speech that in the past there was bipartisan support for only judicial officers of federal jurisdictions&mdash;federally appointed judges&mdash;having the capacity to do so, but he now he proffered two reasons for wanting to deviate from a policy which had had bipartisan support in this place for over a decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, he argued that Federal Court judges were refusing to exercise the power because they had expressed concern about the workload involved. In particular, the Attorney noted the concerns expressed by judges to both the present and previous governments that the performance of the duties associated with the issuing of warrants should not interfere with the performance of their duties as judges. Of course, it is a curious state of events when you find this Attorney lobbying for, advocating on behalf of, the judiciary. He does not do it consistently, he does not do it often.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, Mr Williams noted that the High Court had recently indicated that the use of judges as designated officials to perform certain admin functions may be incompatible with the performance of their judicial functions, thereby undermining public confidence in the independence and integrity of the judiciary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in answer to a question in the House of Representatives just a couple of weeks ago, he added a third reason as to why 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6620"> he believed it was inappropriate for judges to continue to perform this function. He contended that judges had also expressed concern that they may be subject to judicial review by members of their own court in relation to admin decisions made by them in respect of telecommunications interception warrants. Mr Williams noted that this may turn out to be a cause of embarrassment to the judges concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While these arguments have some probative force on their face, none ultimately support the contention advanced by the Attorney. The second and third reasons simply do not withstand rational debate and the first of itself is not an argument for granting the power to deputy presidents and senior members of the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to this concern which has been expressed by judges about their workload. Judicial officers have expressed the view that this current workload precludes them from issuing warrants, and that is obviously a matter of grave concern. Recent High Court cases, such as the Wilson case, have recognised that if judicial officers are to be validly vested with the power to issue telecommunications interception warrants, then they must be provided with the resources to enable them to carry out this function in such a way so as not to interfere with their primary function as judicial officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's solution to this problem is to try to vest this power in people who are evidently less qualified. No serious consideration has been given by this government or this Attorney to providing additional resources to the judges or to making additional judicial appointments. This is a government of slash and burn when it comes to the administration of justice, from the enforcement agencies to the courts. At a time when there is some pressure on the courts to perform their functions, from the High Court down to other courts of more limited jurisdiction, this government's response is not to solve the problem at the source but to try to deviate from essential policy considerations, policy tenets which have been held strong and firm by the Australian public.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last two years this government has kept judicial resources relatively static, despite considerable increases in the judicial workload. It should be noted that there was a considerable reduction in financial resources to the courts in the 1996-97 financial year. Some of that funding has been restored because of workload increases in 1997-98, but the total number of judges, for instance, has remained relatively static over this period. So whilst funding has remained relatively static, the value of these resources has not. When the effects of inflation and salary increases are included, the loss of resources to our federal courts has become significant. We have a ridiculous situation here, one that was highlighted quite well over the weekend by the Chief Justice of the High Court in expressing his concerns about the impact on Australia's judicial system. His concern has been highlighted by the fact that the High Court cannot even remain open to the public on weekends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This sort of penny-pinching mindlessness is something which obviously must concern the judges of all jurisdictions. As a consequence it is not surprising that, when they see the frugality of this government, they should threaten to withdraw their labour. There has been static funding in actual terms but not in real terms, but the workload has increased some 4 per cent over the last two years. The Family Court's workload has increased by approximately 10 per cent. The High Court cannot stretch that much further. Its workload has remained relatively static.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Federal Court is also now being asked by this government to take on additional responsibilities in industrial relations, native title and human rights&mdash;all those areas&mdash;without any adequate compensation in terms of increased resources. On the other hand, the Family Court has had its services cut all over Australia, particularly the judicial counselling circuits which hit hardest regional centres. We have gone through those before. The government has put pressure on judges and is now screaming at the outcome of the government's pressures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second concern raised by the Attorney-General relates to the appropriateness for judges to exercise the admin power to issue 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6621"> Telecom interception warrants. The Attorney-General said in his second reading speech that the High Court had recently expressed concerns in this regard. Either the Attorney-General has not bothered to read the High Court cases or he is deliberately misrepresenting them. The concerns expressed by the Attorney-General are simply unfounded. In the most recent High Court authority on the subject, the Grollo case, the High Court held six to one that the exercise of the power to issue Telecom warrants by a judge, provided certain basic conditions were met, was not inconsistent with the exercise of judicial power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more general issue of the constitutionality of federal judges exercising the admin power of the Commonwealth was discussed again by the High Court in last year's Wilson case. The case concerned the appointment of Justice Mathews in respect of the Hindmarsh Island bridge. In that particular case, all the judges noted that the issuing of Telecom interception warrants was not an issue before the court and specifically accepted the previous authority on the subject&mdash;namely, the Grollo case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think there is any cause at all for the concern expressed by the Attorney-General in respect of this particular counsel. I note this view is also supported by the Chief General Counsel's legal advice provided in May last year in relation to the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill. Whilst I sometimes disagree with Mr Burmester, I note that on this issue he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the majority&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and he was talking about in Grollo&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was prepared to uphold the particular exercise of power in question as it was the judges "deciding independently of the applicant agency whether an interception warrant should issue that separates the eligible judge from the executive function of law enforcement. It is the recognition of that independent role that preserves public confidence in the judiciary as an institution."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Once again I do not known why the Attorney-General has proffered this particular argument, but it is not supported in any sense at all by the law.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final reason proffered by Mr Williams is that it is in some way inappropriate for judges issuing Telecom interception warrants to be subject to judicial review by judges within their own court. It may not have occurred to the Attorney-General that judges are already subject to judicial review by way of appeal in relation to decisions that they make in exercising their judicial power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Judges are no strangers to review by their fellow judges. In the course of judicial review, decision makers merely submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the court reviewing the matter. They do not ordinarily appear as witnesses nor are they cross-examined on the basis of the decision. Rather, a statement of reasons is submitted in evidence. That statement either stands or falls on its own merits. So in practice this is no different to what happens when judicial determinations go on appeal. To suggest that in some way this process is inappropriate is not worthy of the Attorney-General. In summary, none of the reasons offered by the government have any probity or weight. They have no real substance at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before concluding there is one matter I would like to comment on&mdash;the assertion made by the Attorney-General in both the press and the House in recent days that the Labor Party is driven by some hidden agenda to remove from our law enforcement agencies the power to issue Telecom interception warrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I and every member of the Labor Party are offended by this gross assertion. For the very detailed and logical reasons I have explained we do have some genuine concerns about the government's proposals in this area. The government and opposition may well generally disagree about the level of privacy protection that needs to be afforded to Australian citizens in issuing these warrants, but to suggest that we would want to jeopardise future criminal investigations is simply contemptuous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney-General's comments, for instance, ignore the long and proud history that we have had in this place of not just supporting but also initiating initiatives in this area to ensure that law enforcement agencies 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6622"> have access to this useful investigative technique, subject to adequate privacy safeguards and controls. His comments ignore the fact that it is this government, not the Labor Party, which has cut close to $40 million from the Australian Federal Police budget over the last two years. It is his government that has cut $7&half; million from last year's budget of the National Crime Authority. It is his government that has cut funding to other law enforcement agencies such as Austrac, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and the customs office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, the suggestion made by the Attorney-General is scandalous and can very easily be rebutted. If anything, it is this government's history in this area which demonstrates the reason for the position it has taken in relation to this issue. It wants to fudge. It wants to blame someone else for the fact the heroin is prevalently available on the streets of Australia at the moment and young kids are dying day after day from it. It wants to blame the other side of parliament for its inefficiency and inadequacy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You cannot rip the guts out of our federal policing networks as this government has done and then claim that, because we are not going to accept one measure in this parliament, we are not dinkum about law enforcement. We are. It is this Attorney-General and this government that slashed law enforcement agencies' funding over the last two budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not matter how much power you give the agency, if they have not got the resources to exercise that power, then they are not going to be able to do their job. This government stands condemned of ripping away those critical and vital resources. It also stands condemned of trying to fudge and scam its way out of having responsibility for that. It will not be allowed to do that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since 1979 Australian law enforcement agencies have had the power in specified and controlled circumstances to intercept telecommunications in this country. At the time this legislation came into being, the Australian Democrats voiced their concern about possible incursions on the privacy and, therefore, the civil liberties of the Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people. But we recognised then, as we do now, that the issue is one of balance and of appropriate protection for the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nineteen years ago the then Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Don Chipp, had the following to say in his speech during the second reading debate on the Telecommunications Interception Bill 1979:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the last state campaigns I attended, when I walked through streets in St Kilda in Melbourne and Kings Cross in Sydney I was shocked in a period of half an hour, to actually meet and see 14 young Australians who were addicted to heroin . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Needless to say, if former Senator Chipp were to go on a similar walk down the street on any given Friday or Saturday night 19 years later, not only have things not changed much but they might well have got worse. The difference now is that he need not limit himself to the streets of St Kilda and Kings Cross. A similar story is now played out in the cities and suburbs of Perth, Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin, Hobart, and in major regional and country centres. Sadly, former Senator Chipp's prediction in 1972, when he was Minister for Customs and Excise, that `by 1980, heroin would be the greatest single problem of our young people' has come true in many respects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is all relevant because a cursory look at the report produced under the Telecommunications Interception Act for the year ending 30 June 1996 illustrates that overwhelmingly most interception warrants are used for law enforcement against the trafficking of drugs, particularly hard drugs. I refer honourable senators to page 19 of that report and the table contained therein. It states that in the categories of serious offences, under which intercept warrants were issued, the following numbers were recorded for the 1995&hyphen;96 period: murder, four warrants; narcotics offences, 207 warrants; loss of life, three warrants; trafficking of drugs, nine warrants; serious fraud, six warrants; and serious loss of revenue, two warrants. The total is 15 for non&hyphen;drug offences and 216 for drug offences. In 1994&hyphen;95, the warrant record was: murder, one; narcotics offences, 213; loss of life, four; trafficking in drugs, eight; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6623"> serious fraud, four; and serious loss of revenue, zero&mdash;the same pattern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the area of law enforcement which has the greatest demand for telecommunications interception warrants is drug law enforcement and I expect it will continue to be so. Villains do not have concern for civil liberties, nor do they care much for issues of privacy, the rule of law, or for that matter, the value of human life. They care for profits built on the misery of other human beings. They are people totally devoid of conscience or morality. That is not to say that all victims who use drugs are criminals, or indeed should be considered as such. Users and dealers, and especially the big&hyphen;time dealers, are different categories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the Australian Democrats have been at the forefront of the debate in trying to seek a rational, enlightened approach to the issue of heroin addiction, such as the now scuttled ACT heroin trial. The government does not have the answers, we do not think Labor has the answers and we doubt that we have the answers. But we certainly do believe that we should continue to explore methods of finding the answers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The response of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to the ACT heroin trial is the classic reactionary position of putting your head in the sand. It stands as a testament to the lack of any attempt to find new solutions to this problem. As I have clearly outlined in my quotes from former Senator Chipp, this is a longstanding problem, and we have to deal with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just a month ago, on 25 August, Senator Lees asked the following supplementary question on the heroin trial:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I thank the minister for his answer. I am aware that some of the states are now tackling this issue in a variety of ways, but what specifically is the Commonwealth now going to do in particular to support those people, particularly young people and their families, where heroin addiction is already a problem?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Herron, for the government, replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has an overriding responsibility. I think the message that we have sent in relation to the restriction on the trial in the ACT is a clear demonstration that the government believes that a trial of that nature will not succeed in developing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a clear strategy to solve this problem. What we are doing in facilitating this meeting of the national drug strategy group so that further consultation can occur.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In our view, what Senator Herron was saying was: we do not know what will or will not work, so we will continue along the same ineffectual path and simply ignore constructive attempts to find a solution, such as the ACT heroin trial. While young Australians are being exploited by the big boys in drugs and are indeed dying, Senator Herron has told the Senate that the government is going to have a meeting. It is a sad and tragic irony that the amendment bill currently before the Senate&mdash;to provide warrants that will be used primarily in drug law enforcement&mdash;is about as much as is being done at present about the terrible figures of heroin addiction in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this bill is not about the ACT heroin trial, I have taken the opportunity to illustrate the importance of this particular mechanism in the fight against drugs, and to illustrate as well that it remains, unfortunately, one of the prime methods of identifying those who prey on our people, particularly our young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Law enforcement is an intrusive exercise, but so is criminal activity. What we are talking about here is trying to strike a balance between what is reasonably necessary to promote public safety and adherence to law on the one hand, and the safety mechanisms which prevent an abuse of the state's power on the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike many of the theoreticians who I hear talking to me about these matters, I am aware of what it means to be oppressed by an oppressive government with oppressive powers. I tell you, when I look at this bill and the amendments, I do not feel that hot, heavy, fatal hand that can lie behind excessive abuse of powers. I think this bill, by and large, maintains the balance which retains Australia's foremost place among the most enlightened of countries in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telecommunications interceptions are not a new phenomenon in Australia. As I have stated, the enabling legislation came into force in 1979. However, confidence in the administration of the law is the responsibility of the government of the day. Just last Friday, the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6624"> Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Gerard Brennan, emphasised this point when he said in his address on the state of the judicature, in illustrating what is to be governed by the role of law:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we are to be governed by the rule law, we must have a Judicature to administer it . . . it must be a judicature that has the confidence of the people, without which it loses its authority and thereby loses its ability to perform its functions.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Australians have a right to be treated justly and to also feel they are being treated justly. The principle is often cited as justice needs not only to be done but to be seen to be done&mdash;to be transparent, to be open, to be above board. This means that when intrusive law enforcement is deemed necessary, as it is in drug law enforcement, sufficient safeguards and monitoring procedures need to be in place. By and large, the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 provides for an extensive range of safeguards. Chief amongst those is the requirement that interception warrants be issued by Federal Court judges but it also includes substantial reporting procedures to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Federal judges have a limitation. They are not usually experienced or operating on a daily basis with criminal law. It is fallacious to argue that they have that understanding as deeply as do Supreme Court judges operating in the states. But coming from their background of course they understand criminal law and the necessities of the rule of law. I have never been concerned that Federal Court judges do not have quite the same interaction with criminal law as do other judges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the Commonwealth is in a dilemma as a consequence of the Grollo decision&mdash;a dilemma, I might add, that has not been of the government's making. You can blame them for a lot of things but that is not their fault. Without going into the complex constitutional arguments, the High Court has said in the Grollo case that the issuing of those telecommunications warrants is indeed an administrative not a judicial function. It was quite clear on that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of the separation of powers under our constitution, this in practical terms means that judges cannot be compelled 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to perform functions, although I acknowledge that the High Court has also said that it was permissible for judges to continue in that function as a designated person. I think the use of that word `compelled' needs to be re&hyphen;emphasised. To those who have argued to me that judges and no&hyphen;one but judges should do this job I have said, `Yes, I agree with you, but what happens if they don't?' They said, `You must make them.' I think that is not only improper but impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that most Federal Court judges have declared they no longer wish to or do not feel legally able to perform the function of issuing telecommunication intercept warrants. In the second reading speech the Attorney-General was quite clear, and the judges have had plenty of time to rebut it if it were untrue. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments are necessary because the eligible judges of the Federal Court have decided that they should no longer perform this function.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In plain English that is impossible to misunderstand. That is a very clear statement. Once again, for those people who say that they and no other should do it, I say, `What happens if they stop doing it?' They shrug their shoulders. Quite frankly, I treat with contempt people who shrug their shoulders when asked a legitimate question, because they have to offer a solution. If the judges will not, what then are we to do? What is the government to do? Stop the process of interception warrants that deal particularly with the area of drug lords and their kind?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's proposal is to allow what they consider&mdash;and they very clearly consider it&mdash;to be a second best or a next best option; not second best in the sense that it is utterly unacceptable but second best in the sense that the Attorney-General and this government have made it quite clear they would prefer judges to continue with this role. They have said that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal members should be used as eligible persons to issue interception warrants. I quote the Attorney-General again, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should also point out that the amendments do not in any way alter the provisions which permit judges to issue warrants should their views change at some time in the future. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6625">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Judges will continue to have precedence and to be asked to give precedence in this matter. There has been some concern that the use of Administrative Appeals Tribunal members may in some way compromise the integrity of this process. Unfortunately, I did not have time to check my figures, but I recall that 15 members of the AAT are either judges or qualified to be judges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note from the outset that the Australian Democrats have great faith in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and its personnel and we think it has a very credible record. Indeed, the presidential member of that tribunal is required by law to be a judge of the Federal Court. So there for one is an argument against the view that no&hyphen;one within the AAT should be licensed to issue intercept warrants. It is important also to note that both presidential and deputy presidential members of the tribunal have the same tenure granted to them as chapter III of the constitution judges, although I acknowledge they do not have the same constitutional protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that it would require an amendment to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 if that were to change. I think therefore that much of what has been said on this matter is an attempt by some to talk up some of the fears that people legitimately hold about the intrusive nature of interception warrants. It concerns me that some to date have been critical of the government's approach but have not put forward constructive and workable solutions. This is what the Australian Democrats will be doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will move what we believe are constructive and workable alternatives to enlarge the pool of judges that may be called upon. We would hope that the government would look favourably on that issue since they themselves have declared judges as their first choice before any other. Supreme Court judges in particular, as I have outlined, have extensive criminal experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our alternatives will not only meet the dual requirement of attempting to assist the government in its dilemma, but also build in appropriate alternatives which we think that they have not attended to in somewhat limit 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing their alternatives. The Attorney-General in his second reading speech stated that he is reluctant to see changes resulting in warrants being issued by non-judicial officers and noted that the settling on the proposed new arrangements was not an easy task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We note the Attorney's reluctance, and we believe him, to move towards non-judicial officers, and we note that if that is truly the case then the amendments we propose, which should have been circulated by now, should, we hope, attract support. We have tried to strike a balance by allowing the government the option of approaching judges first, and only approaching AAT members once judges are unable to do the job, either at the federal or at the state level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I close by saying that this is a particularly prickly issue. This is an issue which goes to the heart of state power. This is an issue which goes to the heart of individual fears about the abuse of state power. All of us in this Senate would be foolish to believe that that power could never, not once, be abused, and that abuse needs to be guarded against and continually focused on as a fear. The other side of the coin&mdash;not to have warrants, not to perform this function and not to give this power, appropriately managed, to government&mdash;would be absolutely unacceptable. I look forward to the debate tomorrow.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Murray, in a very lucid speech, has talked about the balance that ought be struck in giving out or restraining the ability to intercept telecommunications. Originally the central point of this act was to protect the privacy of conversations between citizens of this country. It is becoming more and more apparent that that protection that was so jealously guarded before 1979 is being more and more eroded. The central section of this act ought to be section 7 which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Telecommunications not to be intercepted</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a communication passing over a telecommunications system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is a penalty of two years imprisonment provided for under section 105 of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be very interesting to know&mdash;and perhaps the minister knows&mdash;how many prosecutions have been brought under section 7 of the act. I do not mean prosecutions of a citizen who goes about tapping the phones of another citizen or intercepting the telecommunications of another citizen, but an authority that has power, when properly obtained, to intercept telecommunications who either has not adhered to the warrant or not got a warrant. I think the answer to that would be not many, if any at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue is: just how effective is the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 in protecting the privacy of the citizens of this country? There is always good reason for allowing telephones to be tapped, but if we really are jealous about our rights, then should we surrender more and more of the protection we have, not to have our telephones tapped?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People talk about drug pushers and corrupt police and so on. In the present instance, as I understand it, the act as amended will allow the Police Integrity Commission the power, when properly obtained, to tap the lines of police officers. They tap the lines of not only the people who are corrupt or who may be corrupt but also others who are suspected of that. It is simply not, and we should not start to think this way, a matter of obtaining powers to prove that somebody who is guilty is guilty. It is a matter of obtaining powers to investigate somebody who is suspected of a particular crime. That is a matter that we ought to look at very carefully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because a person is a policeman or because a person is anybody else does not make him or her any less a citizen than the rest of us. I would not like this legislation passed on the basis that the police themselves are somewhat lesser citizens than other people and that they are fair game, because that would be wrong. It should be passed on the basis of a very principled approach&mdash;that is, that this will help in the investigation of serious crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have witnessed over the years the legislative creep that has come about in this legisla 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion not only under this government but under previous governments as well. Whenever an application is made to extend the provisions of this act, we ought to get up in this chamber, as Senator Bolkus has done and as Senator Murray has done, to raise the great issues&mdash;and they are great issues&mdash;of civil rights, of privacy, and of the way we want to live in this society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Telecommunications (Interception) Act enables investigating authorities to obtain intelligence and then to obtain evidence. The problem that comes about with any evidence and any intelligence is that a lot of it depends on the way people interpret it, and people can be put into difficult positions because of a particular spin put on conversations that might otherwise be innocent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, as I understand it, the power is to be extended to the new body, to the Police Integrity Commission, and so be it. It has been extended to other bodies before. I think there has always been some protest about that, and that is a good thing. I hope the next application which will be made&mdash;and there is no doubt that there will be another application made&mdash;in respect of some other body that similarly issues things such as these is debated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I can just say this, and it arises out of the royal commission in New South Wales, one of the things that concerns me about the evidence that came out from that is that many a person was convicted on false evidence. So this issue of evidence, and this issue of intelligence, is an important one. It is a matter of some concern that the judicial process, as carried out in New South Wales in any event, was not able to identify those people who were innocent in some cases, and people were imprisoned who should never have been imprisoned. That is a great tragedy. Indeed, it is a great blight upon the nation that anybody should spend time in incarceration when he or she should not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems with legislation like this is that it is put in as a substitution for good, solid legal work. The minister in this particular instance, who was an outstanding advocate and who did, I may say, put evidence to the test and did so successfully on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6627"> many occasions, would understand the proposition I am making&mdash;that is, things like the Telecommunications (Interception) Act and the extensions of it that have taken place over the years should not be a substitute for the proper judicial processing of cases that come before the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say and repeat, it is a tragedy and a blight upon this nation that people have been convicted who should not have been. I hope that, when this legislation becomes an act, it will be used to ensure that only those who are guilty of offences are so found and that the evidence and the intelligence that come from this legislation are not used in some way to enable an innocent person to be convicted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue has been raised as to who should issue the warrants. The big thing is that warrants should be issued. The matter is one of great seriousness and, therefore, the people who process it should be at the highest level and should make sure that any warrant that is issued is issued correctly. One of the problems is that there is no check, or not sufficient checks, on warrants. This is an issue I have raised over the years and which I raise here again. The judges who issue warrants do not really have a sufficient ability to check to see whether those warrants were correctly issued or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some provisions; I think we are going to go into the committee stage now, and I may raise some other ones. When an attempt is made to increase the powers under this act, I hope that I will be here listening to people like Senator Bolkus, Senator Murray and, no doubt, the minister himself in bygone days who will get up and raise these issues of civil liberties which I think are of great merit. I see that you are instructed by some very eminent people too, Minister, so no doubt they will help you in the committee stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

If there were people listening in to us, all the better&mdash;spread the word a bit, get a bit more information out about the value of protecting the Franklin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, after the 1983 election, there was a change of government. The Hawke government came in.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Besides the embarrassment we felt at the overflight of an F111 jet to get information about the Franklin&mdash;something we could have arranged any afternoon with a piloted flight, taking pictures at a much closer level and a much slower level than an F111&mdash;the Australian Federal Police were brought into the matter. They were gathering evidence towards the court case. They told me that they would not receive calls from the Wilderness Society, that I had to go and use a public telephone because our lines were tapped. That pointed to the reality that, if you are in public life&mdash;particularly if you are involved in a contentious issue, particularly if you are on the non-big business side of that issue&mdash;you must expect that your lines are being tapped. That is an invasion of civil rights. It is an extremely worrying situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1983, the technology has improved enormously, and the ability to listen in and to invade people's privacy has grown enormously. That said, it is up to us, as legislators, to ensure that some restraint is put on the invasion of people's privacy in the name of trying to trap or get evidence against wrongdoers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this adjournment debate to inform the Senate of the Howard government's decision to provide assistance to the Redbank power station project in the Hunter Valley. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is being hailed in the Hunter for keeping his commitment to delivering the jobs that he promised when he came to Newcastle in July to investigate the effects of the downsizing of BHP. The Redbank power station project will be a major boost to the Hunter Valley following that downsizing. It will be a major boost for job creation and a major boost for confidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me come back to the specifics of the Redbank project and its massive benefits to the region shortly. First, I want to put in context the impact of this BHP decision on the region. Newcastle and the Hunter face the loss of 2,500 direct jobs with the end of steel making in the Hunter in 1999. Some 900 families are in the local area that I live in&mdash;Maitland&mdash;which is in the seat of Paterson 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6629"> that is held by my Liberal colleague Bob Baldwin. There are a further 1,000 contract positions to go from BHP. There will be a loss of up to 7,000 jobs in total in the region&mdash;a region that has suffered unemployment levels four per cent above the national average right through Labor's 13 years of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So how has the Howard government responded to this crisis? It has responded with job creation and some $65 million in targeted assistance to Newcastle and the Hunter. Minister Vanstone met with the BHP employee transition team and provided $4 million in SES labour market programs. A further $4 million was announced for business incubator centres in the Hunter as well. The Hunter Regional Tourism Organisation, which is promoting the Hunter world wide, received a further $1 million in assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A cabinet subcommittee, including cabinet ministers John Moore and John Sharp, came to Newcastle to take soundings on how the Hunter could reposition its economy. The Prime Minister spent a full two days in the Hunter Valley in July, telling the rest of Australia that Newcastle and the Hunter were not crippled by the BHP decision. He committed the federal government to one or two major infrastructure projects using the pooled money, to be provided by BHP, the federal government and the state government, amounting to $30 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Michael Ronaldson, was put in charge of making recommendations following further consultations with New South Wales on how this $30 million was to be allocated. It is to be noted that the Redbank Power Station is separate and additional, and not part of this announcement of $30 million by the Prime Minister in July. There will also be additional money provided by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr David Kemp, which he announced will be forthcoming with the creation of 4,000 new apprenticeships in the Hunter Valley at a cost of $10 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week, Minister Bishop came to Paterson and, on the banks of the Hunter River, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> joined with entrepreneur Steve Forgacs in announcing the rebirth of steel shipbuilding in the Hunter at the vacant Carrington Slipways site. Now on top of all this investment and job creation in the Hunter comes the Redbank Power Station project. Over a four&hyphen;year period, $30 million will be delivered by the Commonwealth under the new infrastructure borrowing tax rebate scheme to guarantee the commencement of this project. The owner will be National Power Australia and the construction company will be ABB Power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Construction of the $300 million Redbank project can now begin as early as next month. There will be 200 construction jobs on&hyphen;site and 1,000 jobs off&hyphen;site; that is, 1,200 jobs at the same time as the downsizing of BHP. When in operation this power station will employ 50 people directly and another 200 indirectly. It will inject $10 million annually into the Hunter economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The infrastructure bond scheme will lead not only to the construction of this power station but, down the track, to the construction of Redbank No. 2 which will be of similar size and will multiply the benefits to the Hunter. There will be some $600 million in infrastructure investment by the private sector as a result of this decision of the Howard government: two power stations and massive job creation at the same time as the downsizing of BHP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This decision by the Prime Minister has done much more than simply guarantee new power station jobs in the Hunter. The Prime Minister has demonstrated that his government will support investment and employment opportunities in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Redbank project has impeccable environmental credentials. It relies on world&hyphen;first technology in using coal tailings in the Hunter. This was formerly waste which went into ash dams, so this project will help clean up an environmental eyesore that is developing in the tailings ponds that exist across the Hunter. It will provide, when recycled, cheap, clean fuel. The researchers at the University of Newcastle have developed this project with the `Jameson Cell' technology which optimises output per tonne of coal used, generating the cheapest power in Australia. Because it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6630"> cleans up the ash dams which generate methane gas on a consistent basis, it will help reduce greenhouse gases as a result of this new technology. It is world leading technology and has the potential to export this Australian design back to power stations in the United States and Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I quote the President of National Power, Roy Alper, when he said on the federal government's role in facilitating this new venture:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are delighted by the Commonwealth Government's decision . . . The Prime Minister's guarantee is a major boost to enable us to begin construction immediately . . . we are grateful that Mr Howard found the time to list our case when he visited the Hunter.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a major project for the Hunter. It comes on top of a very wide range of assistance provided by this federal government since the announcement of the downsizing of BHP in April. Under this federal government, the Hunter can proceed with confidence.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6630"><TITLE>Senator Foreman: Retirement</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="6630" TIME="9.58 p.m." SPEAKER="Faulkner, Sen John" NAMEID="5K4" ELECTORATE="NSW" PARTY="ALP" GOV="0">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in the adjournment debate tonight on the occasion of the resignation of Senator Dominic Foreman from the Australian Senate. As honourable senators would be aware, with the announcement of the election in South Australia and because of ill health which has unfortunately dogged Dominic in recent times, he decided that now would be an appropriate time to retire from the Senate. As we did not have an opportunity to do this in Dominic's presence tonight, I think it is very proper that we take this opportunity to record his very considerable achievement and very meritorious service in this place and to talk about the career of someone who, I believe, was a very popular senator and a very popular representative of the state of South Australia on all sides of the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Foreman has been a senator for 16 years. That is a very considerable innings. He was elected to represent South Australia in the 1980 federal election and his term began in 1981. He served in many different roles in the parliament. I would particularly like to remind 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> senators of the contribution which he made for a long period of time as the Deputy Government Whip in the Senate from 1988 until Labor's defeat in the federal election in March last year; and until the last few days he served as Deputy Opposition Whip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really do think that he performed these roles with extraordinary diligence and reliability. He gave a great deal of commitment to that role. I think that most of us who have spent some time in the Senate do understand that the jobs of the whips, particularly of the major parties, can be a tough ask at times. You have to be an effective negotiator and you have got to be able to work under pressure. Dominic performed those tasks and performed them well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that the best thing you can say about a whip or a deputy whip is that they have never let the side down. Never once in the entire time he fulfilled that function on behalf of our party did Dominic Foreman let us down. I want to say how much we appreciated what he did, particularly in that role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a former deputy government whip, I know&mdash;as you would know, Madam President, as a former whip&mdash;that sometimes you have to have the patience of Job to sit in here hour after hour listening to what at times can only be described as long, tedious and boring debates. You always have to have your wits about you, you always have to know what is happening and you always have to keep a bit of a weather eye on proceedings in this place. As I said, Dominic did that and did it without fault.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He served on numerous parliamentary committees, including as chair of the Joint Statutory Public Works Committee from 1983 to 1987. He was chair of the Joint Electoral Matters Committee from 1993 to 1995. I served with him on a number of parliamentary committees, including the Senate legislative and general purpose Standing Committee on Transport and Communications for some considerable time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I think you will find that colleagues on both sides of the parliament talk about a man who is a very decent, reliable and considerate person, a person who always fulfilled his responsibilities with generosity 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6631"> and with a spirit that many of us could only admire from afar. I would like to be able&mdash;and I know that Senator Hill would feel the same way&mdash;to adopt the same approach at times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He worked hard for his constituents in South Australia. He never forgot the fact that his background was as a trade union official. He was State Secretary of the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation of South Australia. He came to the Senate with those experiences and never forgot the interests of the people he represented. He never forgot the fact that the needs of working people were paramount. He spent a lot of time with&mdash;and I think he had a lot of interest in&mdash;people who came from rural and regional Australia, especially young Australians in the bush. He worked very tirelessly to see that the interests of Australian workers were represented in this place. He always had a great insight into the interests and concerns of working Australians and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall that when Kim Beazley heard of Dominic's resignation from the Senate he reminded us all in the shadow cabinet of Dominic's friendship with the late Mick Young. It was something that was quite legendary about Dom. They were close mates. I recall very well the contribution that Dominic Foreman made during the condolence debate at the time of Mick Young's death. Along with Mick Young he worked tirelessly, particularly in South Australia and in Port Adelaide, to give a lot of people the sort of representation that they wanted to see in this parliament. We respect him for that and we appreciate the efforts that he put in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank Dominic for what I believe has been long and distinguished service to the Australian Labor Party. He never forgot and never deviated from his core commitment to the Labor Party and to Labor principles. I think everyone on both sides of the parliament would acknowledge that. On this side of the parliament we particularly appreciate it. We thank him for his distinguished service to our party. We thank him for his distinguished service to the Senate. We wish him, his wife Shirley and other members of his family the very best for the future.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say thanks to Dominic Foreman for the good times, the support, the friendship and for keeping us all up to the mark in terms of our responsibilities in the Labor movement to serve the interests of Australian workers and their families.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to recognise the contribution of former Senator Dominic Foreman to Australian politics and to his party, and to wish him well in his retirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dominic came into the Senate at the same time as I did and, in some ways, it might have been as close as we ever came to each other in the last 16 years. I remember that there was a debate within the Department of Administrative Services as to which room I should have in the old AMP Building in Adelaide, and they decided to toss a coin. I remember it because DAS asked whether we wished to attend to witness the tossing of the coin. Both of us decided that we could rely on the honesty of the Department of Administrative Services officials, and Dominic was duly told that he had won; he got the better room.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess you do have something of a bond with those whom you start with. As I remember it, six of us started that day in the Senate: four Labor and two Liberal senators. Three are now down, and there are three to go. Senator Childs retired recently; Senator Crichton&hyphen;Browne retired before him; and now Senator Foreman, which leaves Senators Ray, Bolkus and Hill from that fine batch of 1 July 1981. I was listening to Senator Faulkner refer to it as long service and, compared with the average in this place, 16 years certainly is long service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dominic came from a union background; he was the State Secretary of the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation of Australia, and we remember his union leadership in South Australia. He retained his commitment to that industry during his term in the Senate. I remember that, whenever there was a motor industry issue on the table, Dominic partici 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6632"> pated in the debate. It is clearly an industry that is very close to him, and he was very committed to those who worked within it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth noting the level of service that he gave to the organisation of his party, which I often mark down as a sign of a professional politician. He served on the ALP state executive in South Australia, and became state president of his party from 1979 to 1980.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to join in making a few remarks on the retirement of Dominic Foreman from the Senate. I had the pleasure of working with Dominic both when he chaired the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters when I first entered the parliament and of course more recently, since the last election, when I was elected as opposition whip. Dominic served as one of the two deputy whips, and so I have worked very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> closely with him over the last 18 months or so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I grew very fond of Dominic during that time. I have a great deal of respect for his values. Key among them are his loyalty, his commitment, his reliability and his common decency, so he was a very easy man to work with and a pleasure to work with. I for one will miss him in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dominic is a very quiet man and he does not possess a lot of the ego which is allegedly so common among parliamentarians. Dominic makes very acute assessments of people, but he tends to keep them to himself a bit. He is a good judge of character and a good judge of and commentator on events, in my experience&mdash;when he shares those with you. I also learned in the last 18 months or so what a dry sense of humour Dom possesses. I came to appreciate it very much. Among those assessments&mdash;I am sure that my other deputy whip will not mind me saying this&mdash;he coined a nickname for our other deputy whip of `Here, there and everywhere'. It was his way of describing his inability sometimes to locate the other deputy whip when it was his turn to do duty. Unfortunately for Senator Conroy, I think that will stick for a while among his fellow whips. Maybe I have helped with that. I am sure that Dom would enjoy that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dominic is Labor to his bootstraps. He served an apprenticeship. He worked in the vehicle industry, he worked as a trade union official and then he was elected as a parliamentary representative for Labor. So he had a traditional working class Labor career. Dom always appreciates the opportunities he is given in life. He worked hard to honour those opportunities and to honour the people who supported him. He has been very loyal to those Labor traditions and values. I think that is a great mark of the man, a great mark of his character. He is highly respected on both sides of this parliament because of the sorts of values he brought to everything he did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sorry that health problems saw Dominic decide to retire from the Senate. He held on so as not to cause a by&hyphen;election in South Australia, but I know Dominic was very keen towards the end to leave the Senate. He has got plans for an active and enjoyable retire 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6634"> ment. I hope he and his family get to enjoy that. He has mentioned to me that he will be travelling around Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to associate myself with the remarks that have been made on the retirement of former Senator Dominic Foreman. I did not know Dominic Foreman before I came to this place. I think it is also fair to say that I was here for 12 months and I still did not know Dominic very well because he was not exactly the most gregarious person that you would ever meet in your life. But I had the good fortune in 1994 to be chosen to be part of a delegation that went away. I represented the Liberal Party in the Senate and Dominic represented the Labor Party. It was at that stage that I first really got to know Dominic very well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wives, as it usually happens, accompanied us on that trip. I must say that my wife, Anne&mdash;that being the first time she travelled away&mdash;treated the trip with some sort of trepidation, not knowing another soul who was leaving. That was until she met Shirley. I can say that, from the time we first met Shirley at a meeting prior to our leaving, they formed a very, very close friendship, and that friendship has remained all of the time that Dominic has been here in the Senate, and I guess it will remain for some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We got to know Dominic and Shirley very well on that trip, and I can only say that you would have to go a long way to find better company than both Dominic and Shirley if you were travelling overseas because Dominic, although he did things in his own quiet way, was very much respected and very reliable. Shirley, of course, was the exact opposite, being the life of the party most of the time. I know that we certainly valued their friendship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have distinct memories of our first two or three days in London. My wife came from a fairly frugal background and Shirley, with the background of first coming to Australia as a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> single mother with a couple of children, was also very frugal. Between the two of them, they decided that there was no point spending the sort of money that the hotel charged to have shirts or any other clothes washed. Dominic's and my last vision of them one morning was of them going down to catch the tube to find the nearest laundromat so they could come back with clean clothes for Dominic, me and them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, Dominic's contribution in this place&mdash;indeed, the contribution of anybody who has served this parliament for 16 years&mdash;deserves a special mention. It is a commitment that anybody makes, regardless of the levels they achieve within their own party or within the Senate. Dominic for 16 years has been a very loyal South Australian, a very loyal South Australian colleague and a loyal Labor Party man. No matter what else you spoke to Dominic about, you always knew that he was very true to his roots and his background. He and I had something similar in our backgrounds in that we were both born in the country and were country boys. Dominic, I think, was born in Clare. I will stand corrected if that is not right, but I think he was born in Clare before he went to Adelaide to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly want to take this opportunity to wish both Dominic and Shirley the very best in their retirement.

He worked in the vehicle building industry until 1966, when he was elected as an organiser for the VBEF, as it was known in those days. He went on to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6635"> become the State Secretary of the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation in 1975, a position that he held until he came into the Senate in July 1981.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I worked for Dominic for something like 4&frac14; years. When I came back here today, I had a look around and saw some of the faces here in question time, and I must say that there were not all that many familiar faces here. In fact, at one time I started counting how many people were also here in 1989, and I have not got up to 20 yet. That indicated to me just how short a political life in the Senate in general really is. One of the previous speakers, either Senator Harradine or Senator Boswell, mentioned that Dominic was here much longer than the average senator. I suspect he was in the Senate for probably twice the average length of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dominic has had some ill health in the last year or so, but he is now ready to have an active retirement. I know that because earlier this year I went down to his home and saw that he and Shirley, his wife, have planned a trip around Australia. They have purchased a caravan and they are going to do all the sorts of things that, I guess, in a sense, I never thought Dominic would do, because Dominic has a couple of features about him&mdash;one is that he is an immensely private man and the other is that he loved to stay at home and watch TV when he was not on a plane coming here, going somewhere else on committee service or whatever. He is now intending to go around Australia in a caravan and see a number of places that, quite frankly, he never had the time to see in all those active working years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for his family, as Senator Ferguson mentioned before, Shirley is certainly a very gregarious person. I think she is very happy to have Dominic home and, although she has not said it, the old adage that she is happy to have him in sickness and health but not for lunch every day is not true in this case. I think she is happy to have him for lunch every day and, in many respects, as most people who know those two will testify, Dominic and Shirley are really the ideal couple. Senator Ferguson mentioned before about the trip that he and his wife went on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with Dominic and Shirley. I think there are plenty of other stories like that around here in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His children, Luke and Lindy, and his grandchildren are a very important part of Dominic's life because, as well as being an immensely private man, he is a very committed father, and I think that needs to be said here. Working with him for the years that I did and knowing him for all the years of our friendship afterwards, the one feature that came across well was his absolute devotion to his children and his grandchildren. At the small retirement party that he had about 10 days ago, his grandchildren and Luke and Lindy were there and it was very much a family occasion, as I am sure Dominic would have wanted it to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another feature of Dominic's time in politics was his encouragement of others. Unlike many people, Dominic's attitude was that you encouraged those people with talent to move on, you helped them. One of the largest groups of people at the retirement party at his office the other week was the Young Labor people who had received, in one form or another, large amounts of encouragement to fight the fight on our side of politics. That goes back for all the years that I have known Dominic. He was not the sort of person who ever let his ego get in the way of encouraging somebody within the Labor Party and, in particular, in Young Labor, from following in his footsteps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was mentioned before that Dominic's great friend was the late Mick Young. That is true. Dominic had a circle of people whom he was very close to here in the time that I worked for him in the late 1980s. Mick Young was always at the centre of that group. Progressively over the years, a large number of the people who were in that circle have retired or gone on to other things. One such person sat in the seat which you are in now, Madam President; that is, Terry Sibraa. I also think of Benny Humphreys and a whole series of other people whom we have not heard in this chamber or the other for some years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dominic was getting ready for and making preparations for his retirement. His ill health came at a time when I think that he knew 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6636"> that, in any case, he would be retiring in the near future. I hope he has a long and well deserved retirement. I hope the trip around Australia and all the other things that Dominic wants to do are an enormous success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This man is somebody who has served to the best of his abilities not only this Senate but the Australian Labor Party. As a number of speakers on this side have said, he served it with loyalty, devotion and integrity. I have never known a time when Dominic did not get in there and put in his absolute best.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He enjoyed being the deputy whip. Somebody said before that being the deputy whip needs the patience of Job. I do not know that the image of Job, sitting on what Job had to sit on, is the appropriate image to talk of in respect to this, except to say that Dominic did enjoy the challenges of that particular position. He certainly fulfilled it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the change of government came in 1996, Dominic took to opposition in a way that I suspect many others could not have, because he had served in the parliament long enough to remember what opposition was like. He had been here before the 13 years of Labor government. I think it was Dominic's work that enabled a smooth transition for those of us on this side, because Dominic knew the ropes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to finalise my remarks by saying that I owe a personal debt to this man. Not only, as one speaker here has said, did he wait until the state election after the party preselected me for his casual vacancy, but he gave me a start in this business. I can speak from the heart by saying that this bloke actually encouraged people on our side of politics wherever he could. I commend him to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6636"><TITLE>Senator Foreman: Retirement</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of Dominic's greatest attributes is his reliability. One could always be confident that Dominic would be on time to relieve whoever was on duty.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to say some words on my own behalf about my colleague Senator Foreman. He came into the Senate just ahead of me by some three years or so. I have always regarded him as a person to whom I could turn for advice or information regarding what it is like to be a new chum in the Senate. Dominic was always fulsome and willing with that information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the comments of my colleagues. I will not go over the same kinds of things. I do remember Dominic particularly for his loyalty and his reliability. I also remember Dominic ever present at state conference, state council, branch and party functions. He was very reliable and regular at all those party functions&mdash;I would have to say very reliable and regular at every party raffle, which meant he was ever reliable and regular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to thank my new colleague Senator Quirke for reminding my of Senator Foreman's close friendship with Benny Humphreys. Whenever I could not understand Benny Humphreys's rhyming slang, Dominic interpreted it for me. People in this place may not know what astute practitioners they were, along with Mick Young, of the art of rhyming slang. That no end added to my education. I will not entertain the Senate with much of what I learnt from them, tempting as it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One particular interest of mine when I came into this place was occupational health and safety. I was particularly interested to note Dominic's commitment to that. He was committed to rights for workers absolutely, particularly wages and conditions, and also the question of safety for workers, particularly in his own field of interest&mdash;the vehicle builders union, which I was entertained to discover was the VBEF because I have always know it as the VBU. Dominic Foreman and the VBU were almost like a mantra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in the vehicle building industry there were people who suffered accidents at work. That campaign for conditions, particularly safety in the workplace, was one of the first 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> things I got to know about Dominic. I was pleased that he and I travelled together for that area of our work in the Senate. Still a matter of great regret to him and to me is the number of people who die in working situations in Australia each year. Despite our efforts to see that that is changed, it is not a matter of any satisfaction or relaxation. Far too many people die in the workplace. It was an area of great concern for Dominic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an opportunity to join my comments to those of my colleagues, not to reiterate all those things that have been said about Dominic. I would particularly like to finish by acknowledging his great contribution to the people of South Australia, to the Labor Party and to this parliament. It would be hard to pick which in all of those was his prior concern. He was unfailing, reliable, loyal and dedicated in all of those areas. I am particularly pleased to wish him, Shirley and their family happiness in their retirement.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6637"><TITLE>Senator Foreman: Retirement</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I add my words because I had the honour at one time of being acting government whip on that side of the chamber.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1M6">Senator Allison</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, upon notice on 6 May 1997:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) What is the budget for integration of students with disabilities in kindergartens, primary and secondary schools in the 1997 calendar year: (a) by State and Territories; and (b) by government, catholic and independent sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) With reference to: (a) the statement made by the minister in the Senate, on 27 November 1996, that the `legislation will provide $92 million in 1997 specifically to assist students with disabilities'; and (b) the answer to a question on notice no. 44 relating to the committee's inquiry into the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 1996, in which the department advised `that the Commonwealth provides approximately $10.6 million through per capital grants for special education programs for all eligible students with disabilities' and `provides a further $90 million in capped grants for special education': do these figures ($10.6 and $90 million) represent actual spending in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Does this mean that the total of columns 2, 3 and 4 of Schedule 8 of the bill, for capped special education support, which adds up to $80,383,000 represents a $9,162,000 decrease in capped special education funding in 1997, compared with 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) How are the discrepancies in the above figures explained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Can details be provided of Commonwealth funding for education of students with disabilities for each of the 1984 to 1997 calendar years, compared with 1996, including: (a) the number of students with disabilities by State/Territory and by education sectors, including the split between special schools and regular schools, actual reported, or where reasonable estimated or projected; (b) the numbers expressed as a percentage of the total number of students; (c) the actual dollar funding in each State/Territory and education sector and under which program, element or sub&hyphen;element the amount was authorised, including any part which was quarantined or otherwise set aside for a particular purpose or for particular bodies receiving funding 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (for joint programs or elements of programs straddling more than one sector, please split funding as to what sector the funding ultimately went to); (d) the inflation rate applicable for each year over and above the previous year; and (e) the basis for allocation of funds by the Commonwealth for each of these programs, elements or sub&hyphen;elements, including method or formula for allocations quarantined or set aside.</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6641" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Minister for Justice" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator Vanstone</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Commonwealth does not have available data on the total budget for the integration of students with disabilities (SWD) for any year by State or sector. This level of information, if available at all, is held by States and sectors and our previous experience of similar data requests is that States and sectors have taken months to respond, with some States and sectors providing an incomplete response or no response. States and sectors are not accountable to the Commonwealth for funding provided from sources other than specific purpose grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Figures for Commonwealth funding in response to the question are provided at Attachment A. In light of the timeline available for responding to Questions on Notice, advice has not been sought from States/Territories and non&hyphen;government sectors as to their total integration budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The answer to question on notice no. 44 relating to the committee's inquiry into the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 1996 was incorrect. The sentence `It provides a further $90 million in capped grants for Special Education' should have read `It provides a further $80 million in capped grants for Special Education'. This was the result of an error in the advice provided by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) No&mdash;see (2) above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) See (2) above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Attachment B shows details of Commonwealth funding for the education of students with disabilities for each of the 1984 to 1997 calendar years. Figures do not include details of capital (except easily identified funding under capital support non&hyphen;government from 1994&hyphen;96 and non&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6642"> government centres for 1997) and recurrent funding provided for students with disabilities. It was not possible to collect this information in the time available as it would involve collecting information on each school and capital grant for the period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Attachment C shows the students with disabilities data presently held by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth does not have students with disabilities data for government schools prior to 1991 or students with disabilities data for non&hyphen;government schools prior to 1986. 1997 students with disabilities data will not be available until October 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are concerns about the comparability of some of the government schools data, eg. the South Australian government sector appears to interpret the Commonwealth definition of disability more broadly than do other reporting authorities. Also, from 1991 the students with disabilities definition applied to non&hyphen;government schools data changed significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Attachment C also shows the numbers of students with disabilities expressed as a percentage of the total numbers of students for disabilities within each reporting category.</PARA>
<PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) Attachment B shows the funding information available to the Commonwealth. For many elements it is not possible to determine in which sector funds were ultimately expended without writing to each of the States/Territories and education sectors or for other elements, assessing each school on a project by project basis. This was not possible in the time available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) Commonwealth funding for schools is increased annually by a school specific index. The type of school specific index and in some circumstances the components of the school specific index have changed over the period 1984 to 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, the capital elements, where included, use a different index to maintain funding levels. These indexes, therefore, do not represent a readily comparable inflator for schools funding over time. Total special education funding over time is also affected by the influence of per capita funding which increases according to identified eligible students and particular initiatives and programmes which have been undertaken in the 1984&hyphen;97 period.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Linda and Robyn,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following further conversations with your office, l have revised my funding request for a Pilot Study of Spalding and included budget estimates. Since I've been told that DEET cannot fund any profes 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6695"> sional development work with teachers undertaken by the Sydney Literacy Centre (SLC), including on-site implementation of Spalding training with the teachers who have undertaken it, l am requesting funds solely for my research on Spalding</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, in my funding proposal I have included information about the implementation work with teachers that will be done by SLC, paid for by the Pared Foundation, and studied by me This work is essential for Tangara, to ensure that Spalding skills imparted in training are properly applied in the classroom; and it is essential to my research, since I propose to study teacher outcomes as well as pupil outcomes of Spalding training. Overseas practise, predictably, has shown that pupil outcomes depend on teacher outcomes&mdash;that the more fully and effectively teachers have implemented Spalding, the better pupil performances have been. In all likelihood, the same thing will happen in Australia On a small scale, it has already happened at Ascham and Cronulla High School.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you will see from my revised proposal, l expect teachers to have some difficulty applying all their knowledge properly unless their performances are performances are monitored by a Spalding trainer, as teaching performances have been monitored by the Spalding Education Foundation (SEF) in Arizona. My research Report will include a discussion of the nature and effects of this monitoring process, which I will study closely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To avoid a conflict of interest, since I will be describing the instructional skills of SLC trainers Reed and Margeson, I am submitting my proposal under the auspices of the Pared Foundation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pared manages three schools: Tangara, Redfield, and Retaval The Foundation is happy to support my research on Spalding&mdash;not least, because they have been happy about the results of my earlier research on Tangara, discussed in the final chapter of my IPA report Value Added, published last year. Of course they expect Spalding to improve language arts instruction at the school, but they can no more be sure that this will happen than I can be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I frankly think that my time allocations for funding are a conservative estimate. My calculated guess is that Linda Kehoe,Tangara staff, and I will spend very much more time monitoring the progress of children than a $30,000 grant will cover&mdash;not least, because administering standardised tests, grading and analysing them takes so much time, especially when some of the testing requires one-to-one interaction between the tester (me) and each pupil tested But at this stage, with a DEET deadline imminent and school starting, l don't know how to get round this dilemma. You'll see that I've requested some funding for Administrative costs because research will use up $30,000&mdash;though whether David Kemp's office will have even an extra $500, I have no idea.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you very much for your help in advising me of changes necessary in my proposal look forward to hearing from you very soon, because the pre-testing of pupils' spelling and their reading decoding skills, basic to my research, should ideally be done within the next couple of weeks.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE NEED FOR RESEARCH ON SPALDING IN AUSTRALIA</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For close to a decade, cognitive researchers everywhere in the English-speaking world have been lamenting the state of basic literacy instruction in schools. During this period developmental psychologists, speech pathologists, Special Education teachers, and other Australian professionals working with children whose needs have not been met in the classroom have gone overseas to receive essential language arts instruction from expert researchers. Teacher Education programs throughout the country have conspicuously failed to provide this instruction</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most eminent of the overseas researchers, Professor Sylvia Farnham-Diggory of Delaware and Robert Aukerman of Harvard, recommend a multisensory approach to the language arts, Spalding, developed 70 years ago by a gifted teacher, Romalda Spalding, and a distinguished neurologist, Dr Samuel Orton, associated with Columbia University The non-profit Spalding Education Foundation (SEF) in Arizona, founded in 1985 so that the Spalding-Orton approach could be more  widely implemented, has 90 trainers who give professionals the range of language arts skills required in the early years of schooling. The performance tests set by them for accreditation are unrivalled in precision and thoroughness&mdash;an unsurprising fact when one knows that SEF's Warren North trained the first four teams of astronauts and was one of NASA's founding staff members</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The speech pathologist Mary-Ruth Reed and the developmental psychologist Dr Carol Margeson have taken the advice of Professors Farnham-Diggory and Auckerman seriously Following a visit by Dr Margeson to Arizona schools where Spalding has been successfully implemented for a decade, and a concurrent visit by Mrs Reed to Hawaii to study with Romalda Spalding in 1992, they have undertaken Spalding training themselves, successfully trialled Spalding in their own places of work, and completed instruction as Spalding trainers 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6696">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year Reed, Margeson, and Sydney Literacy Centre (SLC) director Kim Kelly brought SEF's director, Dr Mary North, and retired school principal, Kay Younker-Sullivan, to Sydney to conduct Spalding courses at premises donated by Westpac and the Ascham School In July 1996 at Ascham, after going through final accreditation hoops, Reed and Margeson trained a group of enthusiastic teachers, parents, speech pathologists, and educational policy makers while Mrs Younker-Sullivan trained another. Responses to this training were overwhelmingly positive</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the past year, a prominent independent school has enjoyed huge successes by implementing Spalding in its primary program. A government secondary school with a high proportion of at-risk students, remedial teachers from many independent and state schools across the nation, and special educators, tutors, speech pathologists, parents and clinical psychologists have also made use of Spalding with excellent results. At present, additional requests for Spalding training and implementation in New South Wales and other States far exceed Reed and Margeson's capacity to provide it. Over the past eighteen months, SLC has received over two thousand phone calls from Australia, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea requesting advice and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for quality-controlled extension of Spalding, particularly in government schools with disadvantaged and multicultural populations, is enormous. For extension to happen, however, research on Spalding in Australia is an essential prerequisite. We need to know how well the Method works (1) in the settings in which it is currently being used; and (2) with representative pupil cohorts working with Spalding&hyphen;trained teachers: i.e. whole classes, and small groups, of children with ordinary literacy needs; and individual children with special language needs; So far, because of a dearth of funds in Australia, independent schools have been pioneers in Spalding implementation In the US, in contrast, the pioneering bodies have been Arizona public schools with disadvantaged, multicultural populations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If funding for our research is limited, our first priority will be the study of whole classes in a school willing to cooperate fully in a pilot study of Spalding. The Tangara School for Girls (K&hyphen;12) is such a school. Using funds donated by the Pared Foundation which manages it, Tangara's Executive has hired Mary-Ruth Reed to train 17 Tangara teachers and parents in Spalding; and the school is</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">planning to implement this training on its premises with the help of Dr Margeson and prospective trainer Mrs Chris Parsons (on leave from Cronulla High School, where she is the head of the English Department) Because Tangara is an independent school, it has the wherewithal to do 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this Most government schools lack the requisite funds to undertake such a project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because I am an employee of the Pared Foundation, involved in part-time language arts work at Tangara, and also because I have done other work for Pared's three schools over the past six years, the Pared Board has given me permission to study Spalding course content, methods of implementing Spalding K-6 in the classroom, and the effects of Spalding training on teachers and pupils. My August 1996 IPA Report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Value Added: Literacy, (Civics and Ethics in Schools</EMPHASIS> , contains a case study of Tangara which includes a description of Pared's ethos and its commitment to educational excellence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THIS PILOT STUDY</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If our results resemble those achieved in Arizona and in Australian schools that have trialled Spalding in 1996, there will be significant&mdash;in some instances, remarkable&mdash;improvement in the literacy of the Australian pupils involved. We anticipate considerable progress in spelling, reading and writing, and in the development of related cognitive strategies and skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the immediate effects of Spalding training on teachers resemble those observed in Arizona and in the small number of Australian schools in New South Wales and Victoria which have implemented Spalding 1 at their own expense, we anticipate that unwitting errors will creep into otherwise capable classroom performance. In Spalding coursework there is a great deal for teachers to take in, and it is usual for virtually everyone who undertakes training to have difficulty implementing all of its essential features perfectly. As a result, implementation work involving trainers and teachers at school sites is very important. Overseas research has shown that such implementation work produces  significantly improved scores on norm-referenced tests used to monitor pupil performance on a monthly basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the history of Teacher Education, relatively few studies of the direct relationship between training and school practice have been undertaken By and large, trainees gain accreditation and move into classrooms without being carefully monitored It is assumed, on virtually no evidence, that they will properly apply knowledge and skills imparted in their training courses It is also assumed that their pupils will acquire all of the essential skills needed in a highly competitive and technologically advanced world. Yet it is now widely recognised that in the area of basic literacy, teachers and pupils have been floundering for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A need to study the connection between the content and delivery of training courses and the performance of teachers and pupils is very great, particularly in the crucial years of Early Childhood

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator Reid</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The former department head of the Department of the Parliamentary Library (DPL), Mr H. De S.C. MacLean, retired on 31 January 1992. The Secretary to the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff (DPRS), Mr J.W. Templeton, has been responsible for the administration of the Parliamentary Library since that date. Mr Templeton was given the task by the then Presiding Officers of implementing the 36 recommendations of Audit Report No.6 of 1991-92, Department of the Parliamentary Library&mdash;Review of Management. Audit Report No. 6 was an efficiency audit of DPL and the recommendations addressed a series of deficiencies in the Parliamentary Library identified by the Australian National Audit Office: the final recommendation, relating to a single client service program, was implemented on 13 January 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The report of Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing did not include any minority or dissenting reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The fact that there has been no substantive appointment to the position of Parliamentary Librarian has not given rise to any impediment to the effective administration of DPL. There has been continuity and consistency in the administration of the department in that Mr Templeton has administered it as full time department head of both DPRS 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and DPL. Neither DPL nor DPRS has been without a full time chief executive officer and the arrangement has saved the Parliament more than $750,000 over that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) As referred to in (1) above, Speaker McLeay and President Sibraa directed Mr Templeton to implement the recommendations of ANAO Audit Report No. 6 and the outcome of that process has been better resource allocation for and within DPL and improved services for Senators and Members. Speaker McLeay and President Sibraa, and their successors Speaker Martin and President Beahan, also sought to restructure the parliamentary administration (including the Parliamentary Library) and their review of the administrative structure (which preceded the restructure proposals) meant that it was not appropriate to make a permanent appointment to the position of Parliamentary Librarian until after the consideration by the Parliament of those proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Speaker Halverson and I have also sought to improve the structure of the parliamentary administration, during which process it would have been inappropriate to make a substantive appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is unfortunate that there has been uncertainty for some time as to the overall administrative structure for the Parliament, but the question of the most effective arrangements and most equitable resource allocation for the functions which support the Parliament are complex.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) The Speaker and I regularly review and consider the operations of the parliamentary departments for which we are individually or jointly responsible.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Questions of efficiency and cost-effectiveness of services are significant matters of which we are always conscious. We will continue to consider the issue of the position of Parliamentary Librarian as part of that regular oversight of the parliamentary administration.</PARA>
