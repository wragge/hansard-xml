<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The committee is considering the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1997</XREF> , as amended, and proposed government amendments 31 to 34 on sheet 11 moved by Senator Minchin. The question is that the amendments be agreed to.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT></PROCTEXT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Essentially I am taking a moment to catch up on where we are. The opposition does not oppose amendments Nos 31 to 34. I am trying to make sure that by voting for these at this stage we do not pre-empt any other amendments that are on the table.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has amendments 108 to 110 to ensure procedural requirements in respect of the validation of future extinguishing acts. We will proceed with those. Amendment 109 applies non-extinguishment principles to the acquisition of native title on offshore places, unless where extinguishment is affected by operation of the common law. Amendment 110 inserts subdivision 10 which identifies the person entitled to the benefit of the procedural rights contained in the previous provision and subsection 11 prescribing minimum standards for those procedural rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, it is the regime that we are suggesting should apply offshore. It is a regime of notification and consultation and we believe it is a much fairer one than the government's proposal. It is fairer and definitely more constitutionally sustainable in that it does provide a process of engagement with indigenous Australians, unlike the government's proposal.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night the minister said that this move, which seems very clear to me to trammel indigenous people's ability to be engaged in future offshore developments right around this country, was nothing more than housekeeping in legislative terms and that what the government is doing here is simply reorganising legislation by tidying it up and putting it all into the one section.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, when you look at the government's own explanatory memorandum on page 131 the first sentence says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Item 9 of Schedule 1 inserts Subdivision N of Division 3 to ensure that all future acts affecting native title in offshore places are valid. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10206">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then there are three pages following up on that which are essentially saying that the point of the government's move here is to ensure that the whole range of offshore developments from fisheries through to oil rigs in the future are free of the indigenous people's interest being expressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what this is about. It is about ensuring that nothing gets in the way of the developmental interest, not least the indigenous interest. If the minister says that is not right, or if the minister has other information for the committee, I would like to hear it. I would like to see where in this the indigenous people's interest is expressed, where they get a go and where they get a say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did hear last night in the debate that the indigenous people's interest does not stop at the high water line or even the low water line, and that they are concerned for the whole of the regions they have occupied since time immemorial. They do not have this concept that has been introduced to the country that there is something different or there is some line that separates the seas from the land. It is a continuum as far as they are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to know from the minister, if this is just housekeeping, why have three pages of explanation as to why it is really ensuring that all future development acts are validated&mdash;in brackets but not written here&mdash;and native title indigenous interests are ipso facto invalidated?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We went through all this last night and, regrettably, I will simply have to repeat myself. This section relating to offshore acts, subdivision N, restates and repackages what is in the current act&mdash;no more, no less than the provisions in the current act which are taken out and replaced by subdivision N.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of our objectives in our amendment bill is to restructure the act to make it more user friendly. It is one of the most difficult pieces of legislation currently to use. I think it is generally agreed that our restructuring makes it a much more usable piece of legislation, given that it now impacts on at least 79 per cent of Australia. We have simply brought 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> together in subdivision N the current procedures relating to future acts offshore. It sets down clearly the mechanism for ensuring the future validity of acts offshore in exactly the same way as the current act does. It is no different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to what Senator Bolkus said, the act has been found to be constitutional; ipso facto these provisions are constitutional because they restate what is in the current act. They make it clear that native title holders shall have exactly the same procedural rights as other holders of interests in offshore places and that compensation is payable for future acts that are valid because of this subdivision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are treating native title holders the same as everybody else. That is what the current act does; that is what we propose to continue in relation to governments authorising future acts offshore. Native title holders are effectively to be treated like everybody else&mdash;to have the same procedural rights and to be entitled to compensation if there is any impact on their native title&mdash;in exactly the same way as is provided for in the current act. The non&hyphen;extinguishment principle will apply unless it is a compulsory acquisition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not aware of any reason why any compulsory acquisition would be needed offshore, but the current act provides for that to occur, if necessary, in a non-discriminatory manner. Our amendments go to that to make sure it is non&hyphen;discriminatory and to make sure that other rights and interests are acquired if there is a compulsory acquisition. As I say, I cannot think of circumstances that would give rise to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said last night, we are restating the current act in all these provisions. There is nothing in this that takes away from what is in the current act in relation to the regime to apply offshore for the doing of future acts.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a question that flows directly from that. Minister, you say you are restating the current act in respect of offshore, but aren't you redefining offshore waters to include the intertidal zone? Under the current act, the intertidal zone is an area which does attract the right to negotiate. Where in your 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10207"> bill do you protect the right to negotiate in respect of the current intertidal zone?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="10207" TIME="9.40 a.m." SPEAKER="Minchin, Sen Nick" NAMEID="JX4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister" GOV="1">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The definition of `offshore' has not changed&mdash;that is, below the extent of the state; anything is offshore that is beyond the limits of the state. We will come to a discussion about the right to negotiate in the intertidal zone under the right to negotiate provisions where, yes, we are changing that. Under the current act, there is no right to negotiate offshore. We are not changing the definition of `offshore'. What we are changing is the application of the right to negotiate in that intertidal zone, but that is not dealt with under these provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My statement that we are not changing anything in relation to offshore is absolutely correct. There is no right to negotiate now offshore. The procedural rights that attach to native title holders are set out in our bill in exactly the same way as they are set out in the current 23(6)(b) which says:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to the extent that the act is in relation to an offshore place&mdash;any corresponding rights and interests in relation to the offshore place that are not native title rights and interests.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those are the procedural rights. As I say, we are simply repeating what is in the current act in relation to the procedural rights. It is fundamentally based on non&hyphen;discrimination, equality and equity that native title holders shall be treated like everybody else in relation to their procedural rights offshore. The right to negotiate does not relate to this section. As I say, we can discuss the right to negotiate in relation to the intertidal zone under the right to negotiate amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is worth reflecting that the opposition and minor parties have been discussing the intertidal zone in the context of this debate. We do not have to embark upon a session of point scoring with respect to that other than to say we have flagged it here, we have amendment No. 299, and, if the government feels fit to discuss it under the broad umbrella of right to negotiate, then I am happy enough to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point we do make is that, in respect of this offshore area, putting aside whatever arguments you might put in respect of the current regime, what we are proposing on the opposition side is a regime of notification and consultation. What the minor parties are proposing is a right to negotiate in respect of those areas. That is where the distinction in policy terms lies on this issue of offshore rights. Our proposal is not as broad and as wide ranging as that of the minor parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, we are proposing a system of notification and engagement of indigenous Australians. In a sense, that is where the policy difference is. Maybe what we need to focus on this morning is how to resolve those issues.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the minister aware of the situation in many parts of Australia where there has been a great deal of effort&mdash;and it may well be something which has come to the attention of the minister for Aboriginal affairs and the minister for health&mdash;to encourage communities to continue to teach their younger members how to obtain bush tucker by fishing, collecting yams and other items which are of dietary benefit for the people in those areas? Considering this legislation leaves these issues extremely uncertain for people living in coastal areas who have traditionally fished for the main part of their diet, what does the minister think the implication is going to be for culture, dietary implications and health of indigenous people if they are, as a result of this legislation, left to the regulatory pen of state and territory governments?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="10207" TIME="9.44 a.m." SPEAKER="Minchin, Sen Nick" NAMEID="JX4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister" GOV="1">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I can say, again, is that this does not change the current position. As someone who spends as much of his time as he can fishing, I have every respect and regard for the traditional pursuits of Aboriginal people in relation to the sea. Of course, there is nothing as a matter of law that prevents my going fishing, or anybody else, but I am governed by whatever regulations a state may wish to put in place in relation to offshore areas, as is any 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10208"> body else. To the extent that native title rights are found to exist offshore, as a right exercisable under the common law relating to native title, they can be exercised, as is currently the case. Of course, many of them are exercised now without requiring the sort of fiat of a common law determination. Anybody else can hop in a boat and go fishing as long as they do not catch undersized fish or whatever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing in these provisions that changes the current situation or that goes to extinguishment of native title, or that affects the right of claimants to seek determinations of native title offshore, to the extent that they feel that is required in order to preserve their right to do what they are probably currently doing. They have that full entitlement. All this does is preserve the current situation, which is to confirm the right of governments to authorise acts offshore validly, but on the basis that native title holders shall have the same procedural rights as everybody else, and have a right to compensation for any impact on their native title.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is one of the tricky issues for all Australians to the extent that there are different laws for different people. It is important to observe and pay particular regard to Aboriginal people exercising their traditional rights, but on the ground you run into problems when any other Australian is prevented from doing something that a native title holder can do. That is where you do run into serious problems. However, we have maintained section 211. As I mentioned last night, 211(2) remains.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 211(2) states that, in the circumstances set out in 211:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They can claim native title over offshore water. The Commonwealth's formal position, as a matter of law, is that native title does not exist offshore, but the High Court will ultimately determine that and there is nothing in our amendments which goes to that question. Native title can be claimed. The facilitation of claims for native title offshore is preserved. Native title claims can be made offshore and heard, and are being heard in the Croker Island case. Then we will all know whether native title does exist offshore and, if so, what it consists of. That remains a question for the court and one that will ultimately be determined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nothing in these provisions prevents the common law developing and determining whether in fact native title does exist offshore and what it consists of. To the extent that it exists offshore, we are providing, as the current act provided and as this parliament provided, the mechanism by which we can ensure the validity of future acts offshore and their relationship with native title. It is a coexisting relationship. It provides for the non&hyphen;extinguishment principle to offshore future acts, unless it is a compulsory acquisi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10209"> tion, which is the same everywhere else. They have the same procedural rights as everybody else. They have a right to just terms compensation and they can pursue their claims. The $40 million that is provided to rep bodies can be used to pursue claims for native title offshore, if that is the wish of the representative body and the claimants. Indeed, that is what is currently going on in the court and ultimately the court will tell us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If common law is found to be able to survive offshore, then it is preserved by these provisions; the non&hyphen;extinguishment principle applies. All this does is continue the current arrangements for the validity of future acts authorised by governments that occur offshore, which could well involve Aboriginal people. If an Aboriginal businessman is seeking a fishing licence or a pearling licence, or anything else, he or she will want to know that they can be validly issued such a right in accordance with these provisions. I hope that Aboriginal people, and I am sure it is happening, will become increasingly involved in commercial fishing, because that is obviously a tremendous opportunity for them in employment. They have every right to seek the assurance that if state governments validly issue them with rights of that kind they will be valid.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me summarise what has been said here, including what the minister has said. The Greens&hyphen;Democrats position is that, as far as offshore developments are concerned, the indigenous people should have a right to negotiate. The ALP position is that, as far as offshore developments are concerned, the indigenous people should be consulted. The government position is that, as far as offshore developments are concerned, the indigenous people have no rights. The minister has said that is the situation under current legislation. But we are well aware of the fact that current legislation in 1993 did not really foresee that the courts might be in a position to give native title claim to offshore areas.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond to two statements made there. The common law is in exactly the same position as it was in 1993 in relation to this issue. We yet do not know whether native title can exist offshore and, if so, what it consists of. We are in exactly the same position until a court makes a ruling and, whatever ruling there is, the decision will no doubt be appealed to the High Court. To say they have no rights is absolutely wrong. The bill sets down what is already in the Native Title Act, and that is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of any future act to which this Subdivision applies, the native title holders have the same procedural rights as they would have in relation to the act on the assumption that they instead held any corresponding rights and interests in relation to the offshore place that are not native title rights and interests.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is exactly what is in the current act. We believe that is fair and equitable and anything else, frankly, amounts to racial discrimination.

We expect to move an amendment later in the debate in respect of the right to negotiate on the intertidal zone. We want to maintain that. We will wait for the decision of the Croker Island case. We expect that case in particular will determine to what extent native title will apply offshore. We do not want to pre-empt the development of the common law in respect of those offshore rights. In the meantime, we think there should be at least a platform level of engagement of indigenous Australians pending the outcome of that case. That was something that was said last night.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing to prevent 100 per cent of the offshore area of Australia being claimable, so the whole offshore area could be blanketed in native title claims.

Everything to do with exploration or offshore petroleum, anything right down to the most minimal of fishing licences, anything which a government does would be caught up in this process.

If those things are not complied with it is invalid, because in amendment No. 108 they have to be complied with or you have an invalidity problem. So anyone who wants a fishing licence, and we could be talking about Aboriginal people here, will find that unless they go through all the legal consequences&mdash;if you do not follow it, you challenge; you go to the Federal Court and all that sort of thing&mdash;if the argument is put that just one of

What is proposed here would in practice, we believe, be completely unworkable and, frankly, quite destructive to reconciliation. As I say, you might actually be talking about a lot of Aboriginal people who are seeking permits, licences, leases, et cetera to do things offshore. They themselves would be caught up in this process with potential invalidity hanging over the heads of every one of them. Of course, this could involve considerable investment by the people involved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the benefit of Senator Harradine I will briefly describe each of these amendments. Amendment 31 proposes to amend section 24NA(3) which provides that native title offshore can be extinguished by non&hyphen;discriminatory compulsory acquisition. A requirement of such a non&hyphen;discriminatory process is that non-native title interests are also acquired. The amendment removes the words `whether compulsorily or otherwise' from this requirement with regard to non&hyphen;native title rights and interests. There was some concern&mdash;that we do not think was justified&mdash;that the words `whether compulsorily or otherwise' may in some way be discriminatory or permit compulsory acquisitions that are discriminatory, and it is not our intention so we are happy to remove those words.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 32 is in a similar vein. That is again an amendment to proposed subsection 24NA(3). The amendment requires that the practices and procedures adopted do not cause native title holders to be any more disadvantaged than the holders of other rights and interests are when their rights are acquired. Again, this is to further ensure a non-discriminatory process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 33 adjusts the provision which allows the Commonwealth to pass on native title compensation liabilities to third parties. It will make it clear that if a law of the Commonwealth states that a third party is liable for compensation then that third party and not the Commonwealth is liable. That is fairly unexceptional, I would have thought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 34 is the same as 33 except that it adjusts the provision which allows a state or territory to pass on native title compensation to third parties to make it clear that if a law of a state or territory states that a third party is liable for compensation then that third party and not the state or territory is liable. That is consequential on amendment 33. So these amendments are unexceptional

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are no government amendments in respect of heritage but there are five opposition amendments. People might ask why we are addressing heritage issues in this context. We are doing so because of the fast and loose nature of some of the government provisions when it comes to either validating interests or extinguishing indigenous people's rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's amendments do allow many grants and validations of future interests in land without any regard for the protection of sites of significance to indigenous Australians. We believe that any validation or grant of an interest in land over which indigenous Australians hold native title should be conditional upon compliance with basic standards for the protection of Aboriginal sites of significance. The government's legislation does not do that. In fact, in many circumstances it does not even provide for the notification of indigenous Australians. Sometimes it is probably impractical to do so, but that is the regime which the government is pursuing. It does not even provide for notification in basic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the debate, we have consistently called for such protection. However, the government has taken a view that has led it to ignore the need for adequate notification, adequate heritage protection, in relation to many grants&mdash;for instance, grants of rights to third parties on pastoral leasehold land. In those third party grants, we include the rights to cut and remove timber, extract and remove gravel 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10219"> and obtain and remove rocks, sand or other resources. These third party acts may have a real and detrimental impact on heritage requirements. The failure to apply heritage protection to such lands when facing possibly large&hyphen;scale commercial activity is, we believe, a major government omission from this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our position is to ensure that a safety net is placed in the legislation. We believe there should be broad protection for indigenous heritage. This protection will relate to lands where, for instance, state governments grant rights to third parties on pastoral leasehold lands. Labor's amendments will ensure that any major development on these properties that occurs as a result of such a grant will comply with the relevant heritage protection requirements in such states. That is the basic principle that we are pursuing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's amendments will not hamper reasonable, low impact developments. Our amendments are drafted so as to exclude the low impact future acts which, by their nature, are not likely to affect sites of significance. This exemption is also in accordance with the spirit of existing heritage protection laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendment 67 amends proposed section 24GE to ensure that validation of future acts which grant rights to third parties on pastoral leases cannot occur unless the heritage protection requirements in section 23A of the act are complied with. In respect of renewals and extensions, our amendment 79 amends proposed section 24IC to ensure that validation of future acts of pastoral activity cannot occur unless the heritage protection requirements in section 238A are complied with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of acts passing the freehold test, our amendment 103 amends proposed section 24MB to ensure that acts passing the freehold test cannot be validated unless the heritage requirements in section 238A are complied with as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our amendment 210 we talk about the provision of a consistent heritage protection regime that is applied to those subdivisions I have just mentioned. This provision makes it a condition of validity of the relevant act that there be consultation with native title bodies corporate, representative bodies and registered 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> native title holders. For instance, notice of the proposed acts must be given to these native title holders and representative bodies. We anticipate that this notice will have two effects. Firstly, the notice will encourage authorising agencies to consider the heritage implications of the decisions they are making. Secondly, it will allow the native title holders a capacity to protect any affected site of significance under the relevant heritage protection legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, we are talking here about areas where damage could be done to heritage sites and the prospect of that damage not being notified to title claimants. It is important that they do have notice for the four areas I have mentioned in regard to which they otherwise would not get notice. In terms of the applicable regime, we are ensuring that the government's section 238A and relevant state regimes are abided by in respect of the process. But without such a provision in those four areas I mentioned, we believe there would not be sufficient notification of interested parties. We also believe it should be imperative to ensure that the state authorities in particular that may have the task of validating take into account heritage protection as a relevant and important consideration.</PARA>

It is not unreasonable, considering that those sections have not now been removed from the bill, that heritage protection be extended to those areas which have not been successfully removed by means of amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Heritage protection should be dealt with under heritage protection legislation. Environmental issues should be dealt with under environmental protection legislation. This is again a case of where good intentions result in, quite often, disastrous unintended consequences. We in the past as liberal governments have sponsored and put in place heritage protection legislation. We acknowledge that it is very important and something that should apply. In a legislative sense, and for the purposes of effective land management in Australia, you should not mix up the two. This native title act should deal with native title and the exercise of native title rights and interests. Heritage protection legislation should deal with heritage protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that these provisions will only add to the uncertainty and complexity. The parliament and the Labor government did not put this sort of provision in the current Native Title Act. It was fine then to say, `Heritage protection is a matter for heritage protection legislation. Let us not encumber the Native Title Act with these matters, because where will it end? They should be properly dealt with under heritage protection legislation.' That is what the parliament decided in 1993, and we think it is right. We think it should be dealt with in separate legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of these amendments is again to add to the  complexity and difficulty of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10221"> ensuring whether future acts are valid or not by putting yet another regime in place that has to be gone through to ensure the validity of future acts under the Native Title Act. The validation of future acts which grant rights to third parties on pastoral leases cannot occur unless all these requirements are met with. The validation of future act pastoral activity cannot occur unless all these requirements are met with. Acts passing the freehold test cannot be validated unless all these requirements are met with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 212 basically makes it a condition of validity of these acts that all these things are complied with and that all the consultation occurs with the relevant native title bodies corporate, representative bodies and registered native title holders. It has occurred. The difficulty is that, if for any reason anything occurs where these are not complied with to the absolute letter of the law, you have the potential invalidity problem again. As I say, it is very broad in terms of what future activity is caught up with this. We therefore think it adds considerably to the uncertainty of the whole regime as to what can and cannot be done and what is valid and invalid. The proper place to deal with heritage issues is in heritage legislation. The proper place to deal with native title issues is in the Native Title Act.</PARA></SPEECH>

Heritage issues are going to be affected by what the government is doing here, as Senator Margetts has quite clearly spelt out. There will be heritage impact in a number of areas I mentioned earlier.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are doing with our proposals here&mdash;and clause 67 is still the relevant one, as is clause 210&mdash;is no more than preserving state based regimes.

That is something the government is considering in another process in terms of heritage rights of indigenous Australians and I am sure that will lead to another long protracted debate in this place as well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concur with that. The minister says that this is not legislation that should be dealing with the environment or legislation that should be dealing with Aboriginal heritage rights&mdash;that is, cultural rights, spiritual attachment to the land, a concern to protect areas of great and central attachment for Aboriginal people. Read that as: this is a document, as the government sees it, for clearing the way for development without the indigenous right being specifically taken into account. It is to roll back that indigenous right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is a core matter. We are talking here about Aboriginal heritage. Read for that: areas of most intense spiritual significance for the indigenous people of this nation. It is a very critical matter. As Senator Margetts says, the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10222"> government would leave that to the states, to the Court government or to the Borbidge government. We are more responsible people than that. If the heritage implications of development are going to be ignored by the government then let that be the case for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the minister talks about certainty. These amendments to ensure that heritage protection is built into this legislation are about giving the indigenous people a measure of certainty, not just about things that might happen in the future but certainty about their spiritual attachment to the land&mdash;the core of the matter&mdash;to ensure that they are notified if a development is going to trammel or threaten that relationship with special places and to ensure that they have some power to be able to defend their heritage. The word `heritage' here is well short of the mark because we are talking about their being, their attachment with the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very pertinent indeed that in this document, which is largely about turning back indigenous interests, this core matter as far as indigenous people are concerned&mdash;their relationship with not just the land but areas of special spiritual significance and cultural significance&mdash;should be protected. That is why these amendments are very important. They explicitly say that indigenous people have a means of having a say under this legislation and uniform legislation throughout the country when it comes to protecting those sites of great significance.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can only repeat what I have said already. There is a Commonwealth heritage protection act 1984 passed by the Hawke government which applies across Australia. The Keating government instituted a review of that act under Elizabeth Evatt. Her report is currently being considered, and amendments and any strengthening that is so desired of that act will be a matter for this parliament when the government responds to that Evatt report, and any deficiencies in the Commonwealth heritage protection act can be dealt with at that time. All the states have heritage protection

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These legislative instruments, like the Native Title Act, are legal documents with legal effect. They are not simply vehicles for expressions of good intent. Everything put in them has a significant legal effect. Because it is Commonwealth it completely overrides any inconsistent state legislation with often unintended consequences, as I say. We believe, as a fundamental matter of principle, that the very important issue of heritage protection should be dealt with in heritage protection legislation and native title matters should be dealt with in the Native Title Act. That is something that we believe quite strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the extent that anyone thinks current heritage  protection legislation is inadequate, the place to deal with that is in the parliament in its dealings with such legislation and not to further encumber and complicate matters by introducing potential elements of uncertainty into the operation of the Native Title Act which, as I say, is an act which effectively governs all land management activity across not only 79 per cent of Australia but potentially 100 per cent offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an act with enormous consequences&mdash;one of the most dramatic pieces of federal legislation ever&mdash;and we should be very careful about what is in it and what are its consequences.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition does have some concerns here and does also raise a new concept in respect of compensation. We have a concern with the government's proposal because, as was reflected by evidence given to the parliamentary committee on the constitutionality of the native title bill, there are legiti 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mate reasons to have concern as to whether the government is providing under this legislation for just terms in the provision of compensation. I will go to the particular area that is of concern in just a few moments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area of concern is that the government seems to be signing a blank cheque on behalf of Australian taxpayers when it comes to the range of matters that it is extinguishing and the amount that it may consequently cost taxpayers by bucket loads of gratuitous extinguishment. Unfortunately for the taxpayers, the Senate has already adopted many of those areas. Hopefully, we will not adopt others as the debate continues over the next few days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of just terms compensation, the law is somewhat clear. Section 51(xxxi) of the constitution provides that parliament has the power to make laws with respect to the acquisition of property on just terms from any state or person for any purpose which the parliament has the power to make the laws. In terms of such property, Mabo made it quite clear, as did Mr Justice McHugh in Waanyi, that native title rights are property rights. Justice McHugh said in the Waanyi case:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliament has laid down the law. It has attached valuable rights to an accepted claim, rights that are exercisable by a claimant before the validity of the claim is judicially determined. The Act has given claims of native title an economic as well as a spiritual and physical dimension.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This follows on from Justices Deane and Gaudron in Mabo No. 2 when they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our conclusion that rights under common law native title are true legal rights which are recognised and protected by the law, would, we think, have the consequence that any legislative extinguishment of those rights would constitute an appropriation of property, to the benefit of the underlying estate, for the purposes of 51(xxxi).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What are the concerns with the government's position? For a start we are extinguishing when we do not have to. In terms of criticism of the government's position, many people have put it to the parliamentary committees over recent months, but it was probably very well expressed by Messrs Fajgenbaum and Moshinsky in their submission attached to the ATSIC submission to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10226"> and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. What they said is worth putting on the record here. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of the NTAB [relating to the validation of `intermediate period acts', the `confirmation' of extinguishment of native title by previous exclusive or non-exclusive possession acts and the future act amendments] . . . would constitute an acquisition of property within the meaning of s 51(xxxi)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and they cite the Newcrest Mining and the Commonwealth case of just a few months ago&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although most of the provisions of the NTAB provide for compensation to be payable, it is arguable that, as there is no procedure for notifying holders of native title of their right to claim compensation, the compensation is not on "just terms". Such an argument is suggested by a passage from the judgment of Deane J in the Tasmanian Dam Case at 291, where he held that the procedure for obtaining compensation under s 17 of the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983 (Cth) was intrinsically unfair and therefore did not amount to the provision of compensation on just terms. At present, however, there is little authority to support such an argument.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The concern, therefore, from our side is not only whether the value of the compensation has to be on just terms but also that there needs to be a process of notification and, as some judges have said, more contemporaneous compensation for the compensation to be valid as to just terms. If you compare this regime, for instance, with what this parliament did with the acquisition of the property of gun owners, in that particular instance we were very keen to ensure that the compensation was paid on just terms and in a just process. This particular case I think is quite arguable and will be argued before the High Court before not too long that what the government is doing here is not meeting those two legs of the just terms requirements of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the rhetoric&mdash;and we will get it from Senator Minchin again&mdash;that there is no extinguishment, I think the explanatory memorandum of the government sets out their position. It makes it refreshingly frank that provisions dealing with permanent extinguishment, for instance, are a matter of government policy not necessarily reflecting the common law. In that particular instance, hopefully, we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will be able to get an amendment to suppress rather than to permanently extinguish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is just one area where I think the government has been a bit loose with the facts. The other question of concern is: what will the just terms be? Much evidence before the parliamentary committees went to the question of value taking into account the fact that it should be assessed from the perspective of the value of the loss to the native title holders rather than the commercial value of the property in question. The Queensland Land Tribunal Commissioner and Native Title Tribunal member, Graeme Neate, observed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems that conventional valuation principles are either irrelevant or inappropriate to the assessment of compensation for native title (or, at least, those native title rights and interests which have no real property equivalent) then it may be necessary to develop new principles or approaches.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Royal Australian Planning Institute and the Australian Institute of Valuers and Land Economists in their background paper said that the valuer needs to take into account the special nature of indigenous people's relationships to land and concludes that the connection to the land `may involve responsibilities and mutual obligations between land and the people connected to it in ways not envisaged by Western systems of land ownership'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Native Title Tribunal has already had to address this matter, but not extensively. In the Koara determinations it regarded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . any attempt to make a comparison by way of a percentage between the incidents of a particular native title and the incidents of a freehold title as artificial and arbitrary.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We had the Dunghutti people and the New South Wales government coming to an agreement in respect of Crescent Head where the value agreed to was 150 per cent of the agreed market value of the land, and so on. These points indicate to us that the government should not have embarked upon as extensive a regime of extinguishment, both direct and indirect, as it has. But it has done that. What we are concerned with now is to make amendments to ensure that the constitutional requirements are met&mdash;in so far as we can provide that in this place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10227">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed sections 50 and 51 ensure that compensation is payable whether the act affecting native title is valid or invalid. Proposed section 51A removes the proposed artificial cap which limits the amount of compensation to the freehold value of the land. As I have already indicated, that is an inappropriate test; it needs to be more than that. The government says, `Oh well, there is a catch&hyphen;all provision later on to ensure that the requirements of the constitution are met.' But what we are saying is let us just have one clause which makes it very clear right from the start that the constitutional definition of `just terms' is what is appropriate, not a two&hyphen;step approach which provides compensation to the level of freehold under 51A and that claimants will then have to argue anything else under the act or at common law. We do not think that is a recipe for certainty at all. Why not just do it in one step?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our proposed section 52 reverses the government's proposal to give to those paying into a trust fund a veto on whether the registered native title body corporate can accept the trust moneys in lieu of their entitlements under the act&mdash;in section 52(1). We are also concerned about this concept of a process to ensure that there is a contemporaneous payment of compensation, or as contemporaneous as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a simplified claims process which is reflected in our new section 53A. Here we add a simplified procedure for claiming compensation where the costs incurred in making the claim are likely to be more than 20 per cent of the compensation that the claimant may receive, or the compensation is likely to exceed $50,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed section 239 ensures that compensation for pastoral activity which extinguishes or impairs native title is payable by the government and not by individual pastoralists. We do so by amending the definition of `act attributable to the Commonwealth, a state or a territory'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think it is important to provide a fast&hyphen;track process. In doing so, we also think that it is important to have mechanisms in place to protect people. Our mechanisms for fast&hyphen;track determinations also allow for a capacity 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for governments to dispute such determination in the Federal Court, and to do so in circumstances where, if such a dispute is made, the government party which is disputing it is to pay the costs of the application of both sides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think it is a fair balance because, on the one hand, it provides a ready determination; on the other hand, we do not want those determinations to be frustrated by the process. We want governments to think seriously about trying to reverse them, particularly given that we are talking, in essence, of a small claims regime for the assessment and determination of the smaller claims in the system. If we get those out of the way, we can concentrate on the bigger ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say it is balanced; we say it provides a degree of expedition which is quite necessary. It also provides one of those important beneficial aspects that is going to be quite necessary to this government's legislation being sustained against High Court challenges. They are the provisions we have put up. We think they are necessary because of not only the constitutional requirements but also fairness.</PARA></SPEECH>

Section 44H ensures that any valid activity authorised under the general law prevails over native title. However, this section of the bill is loosely drafted and requires tightening so that it will not overreach its purpose. We want to ensure that compensation available to native title holders is for activity under non&hyphen;exclusive pastoral or agricultural leases which may affect native title, but that the owner of the lease is not liable to pay the compensation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 155 is a minor consequential amendment. Amendment No. 156 provides clarification that compensation is payable whether the act affecting native title is valid or invalid. Amendment No. 157 will remove the proposed artificial cap on the amount of compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 159 reverses the government's proposal to give the payers to trust funds a veto on whether the registered native title body corporate can accept the trust moneys in lieu of their compensation entitlements under the act. The trust funds would

Under the current act, once a determination confirms that the native title party is indeed the native title holder, the registered native title body corporate can request the trust amount in lieu of its compensation entitlements under the act without needing the agreement of the body that paid the amount into the trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 158 is a consequential amendment. Amendments 160 and 191 are to simplify procedure for claiming compensation where the cost of the claim outweighs the likely compensation and make consequential changes to section 31(2) so that a determination is not required to be made if the compensation claim can use the simplified procedure. Amendment 179 ensures that compensation for pastoral activity which extinguishes or impairs native title is payable by the government not by individual pastoralists by amending the definition of `act attributable to the Commonwealth, the state or territory'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 221 requires the government party to pay the native title party's costs of all reasonable compensation applications and deals with the power of the Federal Court to deal with compensation where there is no determination of native title.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we are saying, Senator Harradine, is that, no matter what intention people may have, the constitution makes it very clear that you have to pay on just terms. Just terms has two aspects. One is the procedural aspect, and I put that aside for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> purposes of this debate. It also has the aspect of what the actual monetary value will be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we say is that, in so far as the law has developed&mdash;it has not developed too far&mdash;and in so far as there are pointers from the courts, the tribunals, the Queensland Land Tribunal commissioners, the Royal Australian Planning Institute and the Australian Institute of Valuers and Land Economists, the indication is quite substantially there that, when it comes to native title, just terms needs to take into account the mutual obligations, to quote the Royal Australian Planning Institute and the Australian Institute of Valuers and Land Economists, between the land and the people connected to it. Because of the fact that the connection is in many respects much deeper, land is of different value to indigenous people and their connection to it is something that needs to be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the view of the experts in the area. It is the view of the tribunal to the extent that it has been able to make a determination. The tribunal regarded `any attempt to make a comparison by way of a percentage between the incidence of a particular native title and the incidence of a freehold title as artificial and arbitrary.' Two points we can draw from the established legal principles and practices are, firstly, to tie it to freehold is inflexible and, secondly, to try to reflect it in another form of words is also not possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one looks at western systems of valuation of freehold, for instance, one will see that they also take into account the personal interaction between a person and the land. In respect of compensation for indigenous rights, both domestically and internationally, there has been an acceptance that just terms means more than freehold value. There is a basket of considerations to be taken into account in respect of western land systems as well. As I say, you cannot quantify it and you cannot tie it to a benchmark. It has to be up to the system to make the determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are saying is that that system has to meet the benchmark that is in the constitution. That benchmark is just terms in terms of, in this case, value. We say that the tribunal and the court system should do that. Tribunals and court systems do that for any other 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10230"> Australian. To the extent that you provide an alternative system for indigenous people to get just terms compensation under the constitution which is different from your rights and my rights to get just terms compensation, then not only is it discriminatory, but also it does not meet the just terms provisions of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say that the government in its proposal is being a bit tricky and a bit devious. What they say in one of their clauses is that there is a freehold cap. What they also say further down in the act&mdash;don't hold me precisely to this but I think it is 53(a), but I am sure the minister will be able to tell us in a few moments&mdash;is that we have to meet those just terms provisions of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this two&hyphen;leg approach does is something that is hard to fathom. Why don't they, for instance, in that initial provision, provide that the just terms compensation is to be just terms as provided by the constitution? Why do they say freehold? My suspicion is that, from pursuing this particular clause, they can go out to the public and say, `We wanted to give them freehold but the other parties wanted to give them something more.' That is not honest in law; it is not honest in politics either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is absolutely no reason why the process has to have, as is provided in 51A, a freehold cap. What it must have is a just terms cap under the constitution. That is what we say should happen. Let the processes that the government suggests determine the compensation, but let that be an honest reflection of the constitutional requirement. Let there not be two steps in making that assessment. That is where the difference is, Senator Harradine.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, in the spirit of generosity. In relation to amendment No. 188, again, we are not quite sure what these things add, particularly the third part about entitlement to compensation arising where the loss results from a valid or invalid act. We would have thought that, as a matter of law, if damage flowed from the doing of an invalid act, compensation would be claimable as a matter of general law, and I guess Ernest Henry is an example of that right now. We think that, as a matter of general law, compensation can be claimed for the doing of invalid acts. But, on legal advice, we will not oppose amendment No. 188.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Generally, in relation to compensation, the act and the bill provide just terms compensation as is required by the constitution. The Solicitor&hyphen;General has given us clear advice that the bill meets all the constitutional requirements relating to just terms compensation. We have responded to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's suggestions in relation to notification and there are amendments to be moved throughout the bill in relation to notification for compensable acts. We have no doubt that we have in place a very comprehensive scheme in relation to compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation, specifically, to other ALP amendments, we have some concern about 186 because of the potential problems there. It says to add (f) at the bottom of page 117:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> native title holders are entitled to compensation under this Act for the doing of any such activity payable by the Government party responsible for the grant, issue or creation of the lease, licence, permit or authority.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a bit difficult. Our understanding of the law is that the compensation right arises from the grant&mdash;the act being the grant of the right to do the thing&mdash;and that is what gives rise to the compensation. In respect of this provision, proposed section 44H, after (e), we have added:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Note: <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Any compensation to which the native title holders may be entitled under this Act for the grant of the lease, licence, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10231"> permit or authority may take into account the doing of the activity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We think that we are, in effect, ensuring that the compensation that flows from the grant should take account of the nature of the grant, and what activities will be engaged in as a result of the grant of the right to do the act, but this provision could have the consequence that compensation is claimable and payable every time someone does something under the grant. If you have a right, for example, to grow wheat every year, then every year the native title holders can come back and seek compensation for the doing of the act. At least it is not being sought from the farmer, but it is being sought from the government party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think that would be a hopeless legal mess and that what is appropriate is that, when the right to do the activity is granted and a compensation claim arises, the question of compensation is dealt with then. As we say, the issue of compensation, when it is dealt with, can take account of the nature of the rights granted and the doing of the activity. But to introduce a provision which could result in ongoing compensation claims and cases resulting from the doing of an activity forever, we think, is a very dangerous matter to contemplate and one we could not support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 187, I think, revolves around the confirmation regime. We disagree and it is not acceptable. I have talked about amendment 188. Amendment 189 is the matter of the cap which Senator Bolkus has just referred to. This is, of course, a prima facie matter. It is a matter of prima facie law that the compensation payable should not exceed the amount that would be payable if the act were, instead, a compulsory acquisition of a freehold estate and the land or waters. We consider that the highest estate in our law is freehold. The sort of underlying premise of the Native Title Act is to equate native title with freehold for the purposes of dealing with native title and freehold is the appropriate estate to compare it with. It can amount to, ultimately, a freehold estate, which is the highest estate we recognise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think it is appropriate to set this cap in place in the legislation and that it should 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reflect the compensation payable if the native title amounted to freehold. Of course, it is not the market value of the freehold. As in the general law in relation to compulsory acquisitions, it can take account of not only the market value but also compensation for severance, injurious affection, disturbance, special value and solatium or other non&hyphen;economic loss. We are talking about the bundle of compensation payable for an acquisition of freehold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, as set out in 51A(2), the section has effect subject to section 53 of the current act, which deals with the requirement to provide just terms compensation. In other words, it is subject to that constitutional requirement to pay just terms compensation. So, to the extent that anyone bringing a claim for compensation believes that the compensation they would be paid if they instead held freehold does not amount to just terms compensation, or is less than what they believe to be just terms compensation, they have that right to pursue the additional compensation under the law. That is the catch&hyphen;all provision. We think it is appropriate to indicate in the act what we believe is the appropriate cap for compensation, but subject to the ultimate constitutional obligation to pay just terms if those just terms were argued to amount to more than the compensation payable if instead the native title holders held freehold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 190 is just a change of definition in relation to moneys held on trust under the right to negotiate proceedings. It is currently referred to as negotiated compensation, which we think is not the correct terminology. This is moneys determined as payable by the arbitral body. In many cases it is held on trust pending a determination of native title when it is done through arbitration. Of course, the tribunal cannot make that ultimate determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government would simply change the name of that amount from `negotiated compensation' to `trust amount', because the money is held on trust pending a determination that the claimants hold native title. Of course, that is the scheme of the current act. We are simply changing the name of the amount to more properly reflect the nature of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10232"> the moneys and the way in which they are held.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 191 opposes a change that we make which I will describe. The act currently provides in relation to that sort of money that, if there is a determination that native title exists, the holders can ask the trustee for the money to be paid to them, even if the person who paid it objects. Our bill amends this and provides that the money can only be paid directly to the determined native title holders if the person who paid it into trust agrees. Otherwise the court needs to determine whether this is in fact the proper amount of compensation. That, we think, is important to avoid any constitutional questions, and we think that provision should stand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for amendment 192&mdash;and I think Senator Bolkus referred to this before&mdash;it is again a well&hyphen;intentioned attempt to see if a small claims process can be put in place. But, again, I would have to say that, as with your fast-tracking propositions, we think this does not take full account of the full consequences of the Brandy decision and could be invalid under the Brandy principle because you are really providing for the tribunal to determine compensation. We do not see that is going to pass the Brandy test, or it certainly would have real difficulties in relation to that Brandy problem, of having an administrative body effectively determining compensation rights. While we are sympathetic to the notion that a small claims compensation process would be desirable, we are not sure how it could be done. These things must be handled judicially&mdash;and judiciously&mdash;and we do not believe there are sufficient guarantees in this that it would be free of the constitutional problems raised by Brandy for us to be able to support it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a number of points in reply. The first one is what Senator Minchin raises in respect of page 117&mdash;the question of whether compensation is to be paid for any activity. He raises one against the fear spectre of every time someone wants to grow wheat, they may have to pay compensation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our clause that he is concerned about is amendment 186 and I do not think he really 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> understands it. What this clause is about is making sure the government party responsible for the issue or creation of the lease, licence or whatever is going to be responsible for making the payment. Senator Minchin says, `But they might be responsible for any such activity', but what we are doing here is putting (f) in after your (a) to (e), and the terminology we use for activities is the same as the one you use. It is not a matter of making annual payments; it is a matter of defining who is responsible for an activity. The government, for instance, in subclause 44H(c) says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the requirement or permission, and the doing of any activity&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The subsequent clause (d) reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the doing of any activity&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And subsequent clause (e) reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the doing of any activity&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What we say is that, in respect of the doing of any of those activities, it is the government that did those activities that should be responsible. If there are any flaws in our amendment, then you may have identified flaws in your proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the activity that is compensatable. Whether it is the grant of the lease or whatever you say, we say it is the same activity that is compensatable. All amendment 186 does is make it clear that it is the issuing authority that is responsible for it and should pay the compensation for it. We often get diverted into minor matters here. In this case, I think if one were to look at the regime of the act, one would realise that we are probably wasting 10 minutes in respect of this particular provision. I ask you, Minister, to reconsider that while we are discussing the rest of your concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A more fundamental concern is proposed sections 51A and 53. You say that the appropriate cap should be the freehold test. The constitution says that the appropriate cap should be the just terms requirement. Why don't you have just terms in 51A? No matter how often we say that, you say, `It is the government's position that people should be told that we believe the freehold test is the appropriate one.' As we have already indicat 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10233"> ed in this debate, the freehold test to date has not been seen to be the appropriate maximum level. All you are asking here is for this clause to be struck down. Why do that? There is absolutely no valid constitutional or moral reason for you to put a cap in this legislation which is not consistent with the constitutional requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern that we have&mdash;and this is the most fundamental&mdash;is what level of compensation under your legislation the states will have to pay if in fact there is an act of acquisition which is compensatable. Is proposed section 51A there to ensure that the only compensation the states have to pay is the maximum level of freehold? You can take that on notice. If that is not the case, can you tell us what level of compensation the states will have to pay? Another concern we have is that the states may have to pay up to a certain level and then the poor old applicant would have to seek the top up, so to speak, to get his or her constitutional rights from a second proceeding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one of the most difficult areas of your legislation to understand. There is no need for it, and that is why we think you should come straight, take the constitutional requirement, and accept it. In terms of other amendments that you have concerns about, you said that amendment No. 184 is all right. We have discussed amendment No. 186. I think amendment No. 185 would be no problem to you. That amendment ensures that native title holders are not entitled to claim compensation from the owner of the lease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we really want to get this bill through by Christmas or the New Year, some of these provisions could easily be picked up. You have discussed amendment No. 188. You have not indicated whether you will support it, but I hope you do.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the nature of the doing of the activity.

So they are subject to that just terms compensation provision, but we do not think it unreasonable to indicate to the taxpayers of Australia, who pay the compensation, that their liability prima facie has a cap which should not exceed the total compensation payable if it were freehold. I think the taxpayers of Australia, who do pay all this out of their tax money, do have a right for this parliament to give an indication of what it believes is an appropriate level of compensation. But, as we are required to by the constitution, we do ensure that where a claimant believes that their right to compensation would exceed that they have recourse to the constitutional requirement to pay just terms compensation if they believe just terms is more than the total amount that would be payable if they instead held freehold.</PARA></SPEECH>

On the matter that Senator Bolkus has been dealing with: putting the cap on at a freehold level seems to indicate that it is the value of the property that must be taken into account. Yet, as I understand it, the government has made provisions for a solatium to be paid. Is it consistent with 51(29) to pay compensation, say, for people's psychological health being prejudiced? I know that the common law does not allow compensation for grief or sorrow, but it does allow compensation for psychological impairment arising from an act. If just terms included that, and if somebody with a great spiritual attachment to the land had a psychological reaction to the interference with that land and, as a result of that, had to take a period of time off work and had to have medication, would that be part of the just terms?

In other words, we are saying that if it were freehold that was being acquired, then obviously the acquisition freehold extends beyond simply the market value and takes account of the sort of factors you are describing in reaching a determination.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are the matters which I listed before, which are no doubt well known to you. We are saying that it is not simply the market value but all those other factors which a state would be required to take account of in determining the compensation payable for a compulsory acquisition. I repeat that this would be subject to section 51A(2)&mdash;the ultimate requirement to pay just terms. Any native title holder who felt that a payment in accordance with the cap on the amount payable, if it was a compulsory acquisition of freehold, did not meet just terms, would have that legal right to pursue the difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has not been a contested native title compensation claim, as far as I am aware. The amount agreed to be paid in Crescent Head was essentially, as I understand it, paid on the basis that it was a compulsory acquisition of freehold, but that was by agreement, so we do not yet know what a contested claim for compensation in relation to native title might amount to in a court case. We leave that open to the courts ultimately to determine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate Senator Bolkus's frustration that we have bogged down on this point, but these are important matters. We have a particular problem with paragraph (f). We think that does leave it open for compensation to be payable for the doing of the activity in giving effect to the requirement or permission.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the minister could indicate to us in respect of 51A whether he is saying that the government is not closing off the ability of persons who believe that there are other principles of compensation than for the value of the land and that these then, pursuant to section 53, can be dealt with in another way. I suppose he means through the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am somewhat attracted to the opposition's amendment relating to small compensation claims. What I would like to ask the minister, in respect of new clause 53A as proposed by the opposition is: if small compensation claims were absolutely not to be regarded as invalid by the application of the Brandy test, is the proposal attractive to the minister? Is the proposal attractive to the government? If it is not attractive to the government, then could the government please advise the committee why it is not? I thought the minister indicated that the government was interested in such a scheme as this. If it is, why not at least go along with this? If there is some reason other than the Brandy reason, why not just go along with it? Isn't it an advance if it is valid?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect of 51A, we are saying that the cap should be the amount that would be payable if it were instead a compulsory acquisition of a freehold estate. That typically means more than the market value of the freehold as the cap but that claimants have a legal right to pursue greater compensation if they believe the compensation payable to them should exceed that under section 53, which is an entitlement to just terms compensation in accordance with the constitution. Their legal rights are preserved in that provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the small compensation claims, based on legal advice&mdash;I am not trying to be churlish&mdash;we are not satisfied that this process that is set down here, which intimately involves the tribunal, does escape entirely the Brandy problems. It is a matter of policy as to how this might be dealt with in the future. Perhaps that is something that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> could be looked at down the track. We are not prepared to accommodate a provision on the run which could well have potential constitutional problems. I would have thought the opposition would be the first to suggest that should be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been discussion in the past in Australia from both sides about a lower level Federal Court. It is one of the problems with the ever expanding range of laws coming through this place. With the load on the Federal Court structure, I am not sure how federal judges do cope. All 670 native title cases are about to land on their desk as well as everything else. I would hope in a bipartisan way that a lower court structure at the federal level could be developed. That would be an obvious mechanism by which matters of this kind can be dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that, in relation to the Brandy decision, we believe that decisions as to the existence of native title and compensation for impact or extinguishment on native title is a judicial function and can be performed only by a court.

Can you confirm the report you would no doubt have heard on radio Triple J this morning that Australia is now the only developed country not to have spelt out a greenhouse reduction target? Why is this so? Doesn't parliament and the Australian public have a right to know what position the government is taking on such an important international issue? Have you got a position? If so, when do you propose to reveal it?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was listening to FM classic this morning. I missed that story, although I did read it in some of the press. I guess that the press probably reflects what was on the ABC. Our position is, of course, as I have said before on a number of occasions, that we want to be part of a good Kyoto outcome. That is one that takes significant steps towards stabilising greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at the 1990 levels, and hopefully in the future to go even beyond that. We are prepared to accept a fair share of the burden in doing that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the honourable senator is probably aware, the projected business as usual graph from 1990 onwards had Australian emissions at something over 40 per cent. Through initiatives that have been taken&mdash;some of them started by the previous government and built upon by us, and to some extent by the community picking up the challenge&mdash;there have now been significant reductions to that business as usual graph. On the basis of a comprehensive test less land use, they are now projected to be about 28 per cent by the year 2010. So it is a significant reduction of emissions from what had been anticipated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has announced a package of initiatives which will have the effect of further reducing that emission load&mdash;a reduction down to about 18 per cent. If, of course, we are successful in getting land use taken into account in Kyoto we can do significantly better than that, because land use made up a significant proportion&mdash;I think some 24 per cent&mdash;of our 1990 figure and gives us great scope at reasonable cost to improve our performance. Land clearing in Australia is slowing and is anticipated to slow further. So 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> emissions of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere can show very major improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeking a formula which we think is not only fair but best represents the environmental picture, that is, one that includes the six primary greenhouse creating gases which are not agreed by some states&mdash;the Europeans will only have three and Japan will only have three, because it suits their circumstances. We can do very substantially better if we can get the full list of gases; if we can get a proper accounting for sinks&mdash;and we are planning to triple the size of our plantation forests in Australia by the year 2020; if we can get land use included in the terms I have just been talking about; if we can implement the Prime Minister's initiatives, which include going beyond no regrets of the previous government to reforms that will actually require an extra economic cost; and if we can include a willingness to go down a regulatory path that some of the other parties in this negotiation have not been prepared to take.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Launceston in April I convened the first housing ministers' conference ever in Australia's history dedicated solely to indigenous housing issues. That meeting resulted in agreement from all housing ministers to give high priority to ensuring better health outcomes from housing. That included an enhanced focus on housing maintenance, which is badly needed; an agreement to a voluntary rent deduction scheme from social security payments which will enable indigenous housing organisations to improve rent collections and thereby the maintenance of housing; and the development of a national training strategy to provide support to indigenous housing organisations in housing management. We agreed with the states and territories to develop a building code which is suitable for indigenous housing in remote communities to ensure that the houses are built to be sustainable. We shifted the focus from build and forget to build, maintain and sustain to ensure that water, power and sewerage facilities are fully maintained.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to Senator Parer, the Minister for Resources and Energy. Will the minister outline problems experienced by the mining industry as a result of the continuing uncertainty surrounding native title? What impact is the statutory right to negotiate having on the mining industry which contributes $36 billion in exports and wealth generation in Australia each year?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="10246" SPEAKER="Parer, Sen Warwick" NAMEID="KI4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Resources and Energy" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Boswell for that question. There has been considerable discussion about the right to negotiate, which, to some degree, is based on misunderstanding about what it actually is. The so-called right to negotiate is a special statutory right given under Labor's failed 1993 Native Title Act to native title holders and to registered native title claimants&mdash;I might say, not necessarily valid native title holders. It is about mining and compulsory acquisitions that benefit third parties. It is not a native title right decided by the High Court. No other Australians have such a right, whether they be the holders of freehold or leasehold titles. I think that is worth repeating: no other Australians have this right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Native Title Act was passed it was expected to apply mostly on vacant crown land and/or Aboriginal land. Now it affects around 79 per cent of Australia's land area, including pastoral lease land. The Australian minerals development industry's experience with the right to negotiate is that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10247"> in practice it means delays and attempts to gain benefits above and beyond those available to other people in the community and which may not have anything whatsoever to do with native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened in practice? Former Labor leader and Governor&hyphen;General, Bill Hayden, personally involved with the right to negotiate process in the Century mine, saw its practical operation very clearly. He used words like: `opportunities for outside manipulation', `measures which come perilously close to being extortion', `seemingly unlimited opportunities to register as claimants', and `rampant confusion and tension from factional and family disputes at the expense of the issues to be settled'. And the talking went on for over three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Western Australia, some right to negotiate processes began up to 33 months ago and are still without resolution. There are as many as 13 overlapping claims over individual mineral titles. How can an industry grow and develop with this confusion and uncertainty? In Western Australia now there are over 9,000 land titles being delayed by this procedure. Major regional cities such as Kalgoorlie have had no new land released for residential or industrial purposes since March 1995&mdash;over two years ago. For the resource industries, the existing Native Title Act and its totally ineffective registration test mean that they must negotiate with unspecified groups and unspecified numbers of people about unspecified rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry is understandably reacting with its new exploration dollars. Exploration expenditure in Australia&mdash;which for mining companies is equivalent to R&amp;D in other areas&mdash;by our leading companies rose by two per cent in 1995&hyphen;96, while their expenditure overseas rose by 12 per cent. Australia's leading mineral companies spent 41 per cent of their total exploration overseas in 1995&hyphen;96 compared with only 26 per cent in 1990&hyphen;91. The situation can only be made worse by the legal challenge and by the dubious claimants to the $310 million Ernest Henry mine. If the action is successful, it puts at risk more than 500 similar mining titles since the Wik decision, including I might say the $650 million

Minister, in your review of the Commonwealth&hyphen;state disability agreement it was noted that between $324 million and $917 million is required to meet the huge unmet demand for disability services. When will your government meet the needs of 13,500 people in critical need of accommodation, support or respite services?

In the two years since the Commonwealth disability strategy first progress report was lodged in 1995, a number of significant organisational, structural and functional changes have taken place&mdash;such as a change of government policy and direction, which was of absolute importance, as you would gather.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has also been an increase in the contracting out of services, a decrease in staffing available within organisations&mdash;particularly at the entry level&mdash;and the devolution of responsibility for key functions to individual portfolios. These factors have affected the capacity of a number of organisations to fully resource and implement the recommendations of the Commonwealth disability strategy. Responses indicate that substantial progress has continued to be made to ensure that physical access, for example, to government offices and facilities, meets the requirements as set out under the Australian standards in raising awareness of the needs of people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As with the last report, more limited progress has occurred in relation to the development of formal consultation mechanisms between government organisations and people with disabilities, peak disability organisations or national advisory bodies. Opportunities exist for organisations to establish mechanisms to allow people with disabilities greater participation and involvement in the planning and provision of programs and services, and therefore improve their appropriateness, quality and cost effectiveness. Significant benefits could accrue for the government as a consequence of improved coordination and cooperation between government organisations in the planning and implementation of services to meet the needs of people with disabilities, as Senator Allison has highlighted. In relation to the specific numbers that are involved in that, I will have to seek advice from the minister and I will get back to Senator Allison with the detail of the question she asked.</PARA></ANSWER>

There are many examples that Senator Abetz may be interested in, including a well&hyphen; known one, the engineers case in 1920, when a young Robert Menzies, at the age of 25, with his first High Court brief, representing the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, had a very famous exchange with the then Chief Justice Knox. Menzies had dared to question past decisions of the court and that led the court to overthrow the immunities principle, which created the circumstances for growth in Commonwealth powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A more recent example relates to the free speech cases, with which all of us might be very familiar, where the court extended the freedom of political communication and only three years later reinterpreted the basis for the earlier decision so that it no longer depended on the constitution but rather on common law. In other words, the High Court came to the same decision but established a completely different basis for that decision. We could add cases involving section 92, Cole and Whitfield; the overturning in 1995 of the Beaudesert principle, which had been in place since 1966; and the Davids securities case in 1992, overturning a series of cases that had in the past drawn a distinction between mistakes of fact and mistakes of law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That only serves to highlight that this parliament has a role to make the laws as it thinks they should be. The High Court is not an arbiter of certainty and parliament has a role to change the laws in a fashion that the Australian people want them to be changed.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Collins for the opportunity. I was hoping for a question without notice from my side of the chamber, but I am delighted that Senator Collins has done it from the other side of the chamber because of the importance of the question he has just posed to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rebutting the myths</EMPHASIS> is a very substantial document that we were in the process of reviewing when Senator Collins asked me the question during the estimates before last. It has taken us a long time to bring it to the standard that it is today, and I would recommend it to every senator when it becomes available. I did give Senator Collins an advance copy because I had given an undertaking to him that I would let him see the final draft before it went to the printer. But, such is the speed with which things occur, it landed on my desk before I saw the final draft. I couldn't do that so I apologise to him for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to say that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rebutting the myths</EMPHASIS> is a document of outstanding quality. It has only 24 pages. I am grateful to the cartoonist Bruce Petty for his cartoons. It is an excellent summary of the myths that exist in relation to Aboriginal affairs in this country. I will give you a foretaste of it so as to whet your appetite, Madam President. I hope that all people who get the opportunity to read it will do so. The first myth is that there is no accountability in Aboriginal affairs. The second myth is that Aboriginal affairs is awash with money. The third is that Aboriginal people have an alcohol problem. We hear that frequently. In fact, it is the white community that has the alcohol problem. Two-thirds of the Aboriginal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community, for example, do not touch alcohol. One-third are total abstainers, in contrast to the white community, where only 12 per cent are. That gives you an example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another myth is that Aboriginal people get special treatment from the government. Another is that Aboriginal people are lazy and do not want to work. For 20 years, Aboriginal people have been working for the dole. There are 30,000 now in the community. Another myth is that backyards are not safe from an Aboriginal claim. Another is that Aboriginal people have special access to housing. Another myth is that special education programs for indigenous people are unfair. Another myth is that ATSIC is another bureaucracy. The final myth is that most Aborigines live in the bush. There are many other myths. This document will go a long way to dispelling these myths, provided that it gets into the community and is read by those who still believe these myths. I commend it to honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Collins asked why I have not delivered on my promise of yesterday. I discovered that only 50 copies of this valuable document are in existence at the moment, of which he and I are two of the privileged recipients. I cannot distribute it to honourable senators until I have enough copies. I thank Senator Collins for the question and the opportunity to recommend this small booklet to honourable senators and the media. It is in the hands of the media that these myths get dispelled. In many cases, reportage in the media is one of the reasons why these myths get through the community and incite people like those on the other side of the chamber, who now run with about four per cent support, I am pleased to say. I hoped that it would be zero, but it is running at about four per cent because those myths get promulgated by people of that ilk.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment. The Prime Minister went to the last election with a promise to introduce the largest environmental restoration program in Australia's history.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to do so, because this was an historic initiative, in fact. It is the largest investment program to restore the health of our natural environment and the history of this country. It is a promise that was made to the Australian people at the last election. It is another promise which has been honoured by the Howard government. An amount of $1.1 billion of capital will be expended over a period of five years towards the dual objectives of the more productive and natural use of our lands from a commercial perspective together with, at the same time, the protection of its conservation values and, in particular, its biodiversity values. Biodiversity is perhaps the area that is threatened the greatest by the inadvertent damage we have done over the last 200 years to our natural heritage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trust is up and running. Coincidentally, the umbrella advisory group that was established by this parliament is meeting in Canberra today. It will report to us on its assessment of the coordination of the various programs within the trust. The partnership agreements have been established between the states and the Commonwealth. Submissions have been called from the public for contributions to help the community to engage in the remedial task of its own environmental heritage. Moneys are now being expended, those processes having been assessed at the regional 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10256"> and state levels and now at the Commonwealth level, toward achieving the objective of a better environmental outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, I can advise you that over 2,200 individual community groups Australia wide have already been helped by this trust and $130 million, for Senator O'Chee's benefit, has been expended through those community groups doing works on the ground&mdash;what has been so much called for in the past to produce a better environmental outcome. The fact that 70 per cent of the grants that have been made have been to community groups demonstrates also that we are getting the money to the community rather than just to government bureaucracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the concerns in the past has been that there has been too much planning, too much government and not enough support for the community. We have redressed that imbalance in terms of the trust. Money is going to the community. Money has been made available in all states, and I am pleased to say that I expect funding announcements to be made in respect of the Northern Territory in the next seven days, which will complete the Australian process for the first year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a rigorous assessment of effectiveness within the spirit of the Natural Heritage Trust. We will be evaluating to ensure that we are achieving the objectives that we set for ourselves. As Senator O'Chee knows, one of the criticisms of the past has been that there has not been sufficient effort to determine that money spent in these areas does achieve the outcomes for which it has been expended. It is easy to demonstrate whether or not the money has been spent. It is much more difficult in natural resource planning to demonstrate that the objectives of the fund are being met, but we will meet that challenge as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the trust has been set up. All of the advisory groups are in place. I mentioned the umbrella group which is meeting in Canberra today. The committee advising us on our bush care program and our revegetation program is giving long overdue advice on appropriate incentives to encourage a mass revegetation of Australia. Some $300 million is being spent in the bush care program. It is also 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> advising us on regional priorities. The Landcare advisory group is meeting and advising in that area. BDAC, the biodiversity group, is advising.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Before I turn to the substantive question of this entire scaremongering campaign on freehold title, which I understand the Deputy 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Prime Minister raised once again in the House of Representatives, I want to clear up the absolutely absurd interpretation which the minister attempted to place on the statement in his own book on page 16. The sentence reads, and it is very clear:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most private houses and backyards are on freehold land where a native title claim cannot succeed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is no qualification in this statement that native title cannot succeed on freehold land. The qualification `most' at the beginning of the sentence clearly refers to the obvious fact that not all private houses and backyards are on freehold land; some are on leasehold land, like the ones on farms. But what the sentence rightly says is that all of the houses and backyards that are on freehold title cannot be successfully claimed under native title. I welcome the publication of this booklet that puts this to rest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the authors of what I think was a prize winning letter to the editor in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Special Minister of State, Senator Minchin, has been quite 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> misleading in contributing to this debate because I have in front of me the transcript of his comments. It started with a question from Eleanor Hall which went directly to the letter from the office of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) in which he warned that freehold title land in suburban Castlemaine could be thrown into doubt by the Wik decision. The comments by Senator Minchin flowed directly from that proposition put to him by Eleanor Hall about the letter from the Deputy Prime Minister. That is how this started. That is the context, not the context that Senator Minchin now seeks to use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really reflects that, last week when things were going badly for the government in terms of the public debate about Wik, they decided to revert to the tactic that Richard Court had used throughout 1994-95&mdash;that is, to try to gather some support in suburban Australia by threatening people who lived in the suburbs by saying that somehow their small block of freehold land would be affected by the Wik decision and that somehow, unless they supported the government, their private block of land would be at risk, their backyards would not be safe. It was kicked off by Tim Fischer and followed up by Senator Minchin. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the flotsam and jetsam of the backbench have all joined in in the last few days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the government tried to give us the technical argument today, but that is an absolute diversion. It was about the politics. They had not raised this issue for two or three years. It suddenly was the pre&hyphen;eminent issue when they were struggling in the debate about the future of the Wik legislation and they knew they were losing that debate. At the time they were blaming greedy black fellows and the church, but now it is the media's fault. They have been trailing through the list of those they wish to blame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the government will not accept that the real problem is that they have got the legislation wrong. They cannot accept the fact that they are losing the public debate. They are moving to quite desperate tactics. What we saw today was a quite comical performance by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10260"> Herron). It would be very funny if it wasn't so terribly sad, because in his second reading speech on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  he came in here and ran the same lines about backyards being under threat. It is a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This man is supposed to be the advocate for Aboriginal people in Australia. He is supposed to be doing things like he did today&mdash;releasing a booklet which helps dispel the myths, helps attack those prejudices in Australian society and helps put the correct position. What does he do? The book says one thing&mdash;that it is a myth that backyards are not safe from Aboriginal claim&mdash;and the book goes on to explain how that is a myth, that there is no basis in fact for that claim. But the minister comes in here in the second reading debate on the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  and backs up the Prime Minister and backs up Senator Minchin because that is their political tactic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He knows it is not true. He knows it is designed to spread fear of Aboriginal people and to build resentment against Aboriginal people in the community. His job is to work against that sort of development, but he comes in here in a most disgraceful performance and helps breed that sort of resentment and that sort of fear. He refused a couple of days ago to condemn the remarks of Mr Marek, the National Party backbencher from Queensland, about $20 and a box of Jatz. Did he condemn those remarks? No, he talked about what a great member Mr Marek is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in this country. He will not show any leadership in trying to rebut the myths, rebut the prejudices and deal with these problems that Aboriginal people face in our community. This is the man charged with that duty. This is the man the government has given the job of assisting Aboriginal people, but he will not do that. He cannot bring himself to break away from the prejudices that dominate the Liberal Party these days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He had the audacity the other day to say that Mr Viner and Mr Chaney, two former Liberal ministers for Aboriginal affairs, needed re&hyphen;educating&mdash;the old Cambodian Pol 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Pot solution. What a disgraceful action. That is his way. I have never agreed with Mr Chaney or Mr Viner on anything else politically, but they have got some respect in this community for their commitment to seeking justice and fair play for Aboriginal people. But will Senator Herron have a good word about them? No. Again he seeks to denigrate their contributions and say he is going to re&hyphen;educate them. I know who knows something about Aboriginal affairs in this country and Senator Herron is not one of them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue in relation to freehold title really became an issue of community debate when the Labor Party set down their amendments to our <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . One of their amendments was not to consolidate in legislation the fact that, allegedly, everybody is agreed upon&mdash;namely, that freehold title extinguishes native title. You have to ask why Labor moved an amendment to our legislation to specifically reject what they assert is the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to have speeches by Senator Chris Evans about re&hyphen;education, he might like to think about re&hyphen;educating his former Senate colleague from his own home state of Western Australia Peter Walsh, who has had a lot of illuminating things to say about this matter, or a former leader of the Labor Party, Bill Hayden, who similarly has made very critical comments about Labor's Native Title Act. Just as Senator Chris Evans can drag out a few Liberals on one side of the debate, so we can drag out a few Labor people on the other side of the debate. It does not get us any further, so let us have a look at the actual issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just the other day I received on my desk a brochure from ANTaR, Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation. Do you know the illuminating comment they made in that? It was that the Mabo and Wik decisions are following in the tradition of the common law of the United States and Canada, but Australia was far behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened in the development of the common law in Canada just recently? In Canada, where a similar native title debate has been proceeding some years ahead of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10261"> Australia's, the courts last year unexpectedly found in the Badger case that native title is not extinguished by freehold title, as previously thought. So that is the development of the common law in Canada. Exactly the same developments occurred in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If these people opposite were honest about their views of the common law and where all this tradition comes from, it stands to reason that Australia's common law may well develop in a similar vein to both the Canadian and United States common law. If that is the case, then it stands to reason that it may be beneficial to extinguish native title over freehold land through legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting to have a look back over the past three or four years at all the headlines in the newspapers when the Native Title Bill was being discussed in 1993; the National Party in particular were accused of scaremongering. All the headlines and newspaper articles told us that they were scaremongering. Why? Because they asserted that the legislation may not extinguish native title on pastoral leases. But, of course, Senator Gareth Evans&mdash;hand on his heart&mdash;along with Senator Bob Collins and others, said, `There's no need to put it in the legislation because we all know pastoral leases extinguish native title.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Robert Tickner, the minister for Aboriginal affairs at the time, said the same thing. He accused us on this side of scaremongering. Three or four years later, guess what? To use that Canadian terminology, we got an unexpected decision from the High Court on a 4:3 majority&mdash;a very narrow majority&mdash;to say that native title is not extinguished in relation to pastoral leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are to follow the development of the common law, who wrote the native title decision in Mabo? None other than Justice Brennan. Who was the chief dissenter in the Wik decision? None other than Chief Justice Brennan. You would have thought he might have known what he meant in the Mabo decision. But not so, because, as the numbers on the High Court change, the personnel change. You get a different mix of people and therefore you are likely to get different decisions out of the High Court. If you want this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> uncertainty to continue within the community, then reject our amendments. But let me assure you of this: the Australian people, in turn, will reject you.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the motion before the Senate to take note of the incredible answer given by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) today. We have had both the minister for aboriginal affairs and the Special Minister of State (Senator Minchin) first of all blame the press for the misquoting. We know a government is in very serious trouble when senior ministers starting blaming the press for the bungling ineptitude of the government itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also note that Eleanor Hall, last week when this issue was first raised in an interview, said that she had contacted the office of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer). She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Deputy Prime Minister's office today conceded that the analogy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">about freehold backyards being under threat&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">could have been better made, but there was no such concession from the Special Minister for State, Senator Nick Minchin.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As Mike Seccombe from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  recently pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was a bungling mistake made by a senior adviser to Mr Fischer, subsequently conceded by the Minister's own office.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But then the government decided to turn the bungling mistake into a political attack to run this scaremongering campaign. They tried to make the best of a bungling effort. They let loose in the House of Representatives, particularly with the Acting Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, last week and again today in question time, reiterating that scaremongering campaign. I think that was best summed up by that wonderful Geoff Pryor cartoon in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  last week when he had Mr Fischer and Mr Howard dressed up as Aboriginal people, putting up some sort of totem pole in a backyard in the middle of the night and being caught by the householder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have really seen, and why this government is bungling its whole effort over Wik, is what Senator Bob Collins pointed out 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10262"> today is in this document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rebutting the myths</EMPHASIS>. This document is issued under the authority of the minister. On the front page it says, `Office of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs'. On the first facing page, it again states that it is under the authority of the minister. If you then go to the foreword, there is a nice photograph of the minister under his printed signature: John Herron. He goes on to say in his foreword:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This publication addresses some of the disturbing myths and untruths being perpetrated about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Trying to overcome prejudices is part of the reconciliation process.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And on the minister goes. He paints some nice words about reconciliation in his foreword; I only wish he would say it publicly on the record when he speaks in this chamber or in the media. If we then go to page 16 headed `Native Title Claims', it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MYTH: My backyard isn't safe from an Aboriginal claim . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1992, the High Court of Australia in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mabo</EMPHASIS>  case found that a form of native title existed. However, it also said that native title had been extinguished by inconsistent grants such as freehold. Most private houses and backyards are on freehold land where a native title claim cannot succeed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what the minister has written and authorised. It completely contradicts what Mr Fischer and Senator Minchin have been saying in the last week. If we go to the back of this document, it lists the sources to rebut some of these myths and it says clearly that the source is `<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rebutting Mabo myths</EMPHASIS> , document prepared by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Canberra 1993'. That is true. That was Mr Tickner, the then Labor minister in the Keating government. But, again, Senator Herron has endorsed what Mr Tickner wrote in 1993 and quotes it as a source in his own document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we have the minister, in a gobbledegook way, trying to get out from under his own document here today&mdash;again proving that this government is all at sea in trying to get any sort of consistent viewpoint together about how to handle the Wik issue and native title. The only strategy they can now put 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> together is to conduct a scaremongering campaign against native title and try to scare urban and town dwellers in this country that their backyards and houses are under threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the minister even in his own bumbling way for publishing this document which absolutely and clearly refutes that dreadful scaremongering myth that the Deputy Prime Minister and Senator Minchin tried to resurrect last week in a scandalous way and they have been caught out by the bumbling Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Schacht has just been talking about myths, untruths, scandal and scaremongering and it might be useful to look at the situation in his home state of South Australia, which also happens to be the state that I represent in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned in this place last night, there are 27 claims registered over parts of South Australia&mdash;some of them overlapping claims&mdash;with the tribunal and to me it is absolutely striking and crucial that less than a dozen of those claimant applications explicitly exclude freehold tenure from the bounds of their claim. It is absolutely crucial. Only they explicitly exclude the freehold tenure from their claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to name the claimant applications for the benefit of Senator Schacht. The Eringa, Kuyani, Dieri, Coultard, Yalata, Maralinga and Yankunytjatjara peoples do not explicitly exclude any freehold land that is situated within the boundaries of their claim area. What a tragedy that Senator Schacht prefers to leave the chamber than listen to information which is truthful about his own home state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact many of the claims that I have just mentioned include a generic statement that says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the application excludes any areas which may have been the subject of extinguishing events or, to the extent of the impairment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">not extinguishment, please note&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the subject of events which may have impaired native title. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10263">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is very important to note that the word `impairment' and not `extinguishment' has been used in these claims. It is consistent with a certain theory that contends that native title may revive after the expiry of a validly granted tenure, including grants of tenure over freehold land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority of the South Australian native title claims therefore leave the door open to the possibility of claiming freehold. For example, the Nukunu people's claim covers extensive areas of freehold land in South Australia. This particular claim covers the South Australian cities and towns of Port Augusta, Port Pirie, Crystal Brook, Gladstone, Wilmington, Quorn and Jamestown&mdash;some of the most important grain growing areas of our state and the Iron Triangle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The claimant application states that it is subject to the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to any validly granted freehold land situated within the area of the land the subject of the application, the applicants do not claim any native title they or their predecessors in native title may have held which&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and this is the important part&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was extinguished by the valid grant of freehold title.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Or, in other words, they claim native title over all of the freehold land which is found not to have been extinguished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely fascinating that the wording is quite different from that in the documents lodged by many other native title claimants in South Australia. I notice that many of those opposite use Justice French as some sort of voice of reason and truth in this matter. I keep hearing from him uncannily familiar reassurances about native title on freehold land in the same way as I heard it in relation to pastoral lease land back in 1993. Of course, not only did Justice French make those comments after 1993, but so has the former leader of the now opposition in this place, Mr Gareth Evans. In fact, their statements are uncannily familiar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting that we now hear from the  opposition accusations of misleading statements being made on this side of the House. Let us not forget this statement by Justice French, because this was a very recent 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> statement made by him that is seminal to this discussion. He told the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, of which I am happy to be a member, that `no coherent theory of extinguishment has yet emerged from the various judicial decisions' and that the possibility of native title reviving on freehold land which reverts to the Crown is a live issue. What sort of duplicitous statements are we hearing from those opposite, when the man whom they hold up as the arbiter of truth in this matter has himself conceded that this issue is `a live issue'? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of this bill is to amend the Criminal Code Act 1995 to bring forward the commencement of provisions which relate to the proof of an offence where the person accused is intoxicated. The relevant provisions, subsections 4.2(6) and (7) and division 8 of the criminal code, provide that self-induced intoxication cannot be considered in determining intent or voluntariness in relation to basic offences like assault. Without the amendment, these provisions would not commence until March 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, the common law applies in relation to Commonwealth offences and the accused can raise the argument that he or she was so grossly intoxicated that the offending conduct was not voluntary or intended. While the common law rule is rarely used, and then usually in relation to the state offence of assault, the government wishes to provide a lead to those states who have not enacted the model criminal code provisions on this topic. In 1995 all parties and Independents in the Commonwealth parliament supported the enactment of the criminal code rules in relation to intoxication. The Commonwealth has had these principles on intoxication in its statute since then. At the time, no doubt because the common law rules were not expected to be used in relation to Commonwealth offences, the parliament did not give priority to commencing the criminal code provisions early.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth government favours commencing them now because the common law rules are inconsistent with its commitment to stamp out domestic violence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Secondly, I table an extract from the transcript of proceedings before Commissioner Larkin of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on 30 April this year. That was when this agreement was put to the commission. I want to refer to page 6 of the transcript of proceedings which deals specifically with clause 4 of that agreement. On that occasion, the advocate for the union, in addressing clause 4 of the agreement, stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation legislation has a sunset provision so that the corporation itself will be replaced by some other form of body, whether it is a private company or some sort of public sector forum, and the parties have made provision in the agreement to cover the staff in that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So clause 4 provides that in the event of privatisation redundancy payments would only accrue to those staff who choose not to transfer to the privatised body otherwise continuity would be preserved and clause (9) which is more or less a complementary provision provides that where, through legislative amendment or new legislation, a new government body or statutory authority is created, or government business enterprise is created which would result in staff remaining public sector employees, then there will be continuity of service maintained along with accrued entitlements and it is not a redundancy situation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is a rather long sentence, Madam Chair&mdash;longer even than some of the ones that I have become renowned for. The clear point being made there by the advocate was that staff who chose to accept employment in a new private sector body to replace the corporation would thereby forgo their rights to redundancy, even though they were technically leaving the public sector, because they would be deemed to have continued in employment, but clearly all other employees would continue to maintain their existing entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have said that the bill be amended to delete item 45 because that clause is directly at odds with that agreement. As I have indicated before, under item 45 any employee who is offered employment in one of the new private sector bodies but does not accept that employment will be deemed to have resigned. By being deemed to have resigned, they will have therefore lost any entitlement to redundancy. Further, clause 45(5) provides:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10269">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a person is taken to have resigned under subitem (2), the resignation is not to be treated, for any purpose, as a termination of employment at the initiative of the person's employer.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As a result of that provision, they would lose any entitlement to take the issue of their cessation of employment in the public sector to the Industrial Relations Commission and avail themselves of unfair dismissal provisions or other provisions of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say that clearly the provision in this bill is contrary to the specific terms of the agreement and the understandings relating to that agreement between the union and the employer. It is clearly also quite inequitable and unfair to public sector employees who, whilst supposedly being given a choice, as detailed in the enterprise agreement, are given no choice at all. If they choose not to accept a job in the private sector to replace the job they had in the public sector, the consequence is that they are deemed to have resigned from the public sector. So we are of the view that our amendments should be supported. Accordingly, we oppose the bill in the following terms:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Forshaw has outlined, the opposition on Monday proposed this last-minute amendment proposing the removal of item 45 from schedule 5, and Senator Forshaw has outlined the provisions of item 45. I would like to point out to the committee that provisions essentially identical to item 45 have been a feature of many other acts over a number of years, many of which were sponsored through parliament by the previous government and these precedents have been ignored by the opposition. The manner in which the opposition has introduced this very late amendment has made this a very difficult matter to resolve. The opposition has basically ignored the equivalent offer of employment aspects of item 45, which requires offers to be examined against the existing conditions and entitlements to ensure equivalence and also provides for independent review through the AD(JR) Act.</PARA></TALK.START>

Therefore, the cost to industry of accepting the amendment&mdash;and there will be costs&mdash;is considered to be far less than the cost of delaying reforms. The government does not concede acceptance of this amendment as a precedent for future legislation. The acceptance by the government of the amendment is only given to avoid a totally unacceptable outcome for the red meat industry. But, given the importance of these reforms and the fact that the package of bills is sufficiently different from the usual privatisation or sale bills so as to ensure that no precedent will be established, we reluctantly agree to accept this amendment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make one final comment in the light of the interjection from Senator Campbell and some of the comments made by the parliamentary secretary. I remind the committee that the original position of the Senate legislation committee was unanimous. The recommendation was that the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R312">Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Industry Bill 1997</XREF>  be withdrawn to enable the minister to hold a further series of meetings and round table discussions with the industry groups in order to try to bring about the very agreement that Senator Woodley has indicated was not possible up to that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was a unanimous position of the government, opposition and other members of the committee. Further representations from the industry were made after the committee report was tabled in the Senate, and those representations impressed upon us the importance of getting the package through, as distinct from this particular issue about the method of calculation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition then took the initiative of seeking to develop a compromise or a way out for the government, the parliament and the industry. That is how this proposal for a sunset clause of two years came about. It provides the opportunity for the legislation to come into force and the system to commence operation, but it also ensures that there will be a review of the operation of the system, and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that that matter will come back to the parliament for ultimate determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we have said all along, it is our ernest hope that the system operates effectively so that we can have a smooth passage in the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are extremely disappointed that the government was not prepared to accept the amendments made by the Senate. We thought that the operation of the act over the last 12 months in the areas of access to the federal jurisdiction from Western Australia and in the area of strike pay, in particular, did require amendments to the act. It is our view, as it was then, that it would not undermine the operation of the act but in fact would enhance the way the act operated. However we have appreciated that the government, in particular Minister Reith, has been seeking to keep the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 as a technical bill only. I am advised that after consultations with the ACTU at the meeting of the National Labour Consultative Committee Mr Reith dropped virtually all his contentious recommendations for the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government through the House has seen fit to accept further amendments proposed by the Senate and by the Democrats to the primary remaining areas. What I understand is to happen is that the government will be prepared to split off from the bill two provisions which remain contentious. That means that schedules 9 and 10, to which the Senate had deletions or amendments, will be excised from the bill. That being so, it would allow us, the Democrats, and if other members of the House so agree, to insist on those areas whilst the technical amendments would progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has advised us that it would then reintroduce those two schedules as a separate bill and that others' amendments, including ours, would remain alive as disagreed amendments to that bill. That would make it quite clear that the Senate as a whole continues to disagree with the House on those matters that they regard as desirable for insistence. With that in mind, I would appreciate the government's confirmation that that is its understanding.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make it very clear from our perspective that we do not agree with this. The amendments that were carried by the Senate were carried in good faith. They represented the views of the parties at the time. I indicate in relation to this that obviously we have not been dealt in. This is not unusual in terms of industrial relations policy. The effect of this is to excise any controversial matter on which the government cannot get agreement with the Democrats. The more cynical of us believe that this is a fairly transparent attempt by Minister Reith to get himself a win.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also make the following comments with regard to the schedules that were referred to earlier which are being proceeded with. I allude yet again to schedule 3, which talks about the Employment Advocate. I have been waiting for an opportunity to make this point. The opposition did not support schedule 3, and in fact moved amendments with regard to the Office of the Employment Advocate. Two things have happened since then. The first is that the Democrats, who, upon the release of the Labor Party's industrial relations policy put out a press release saying they thought the Office of the Employment Advocate was doing a sterling job, subsequently decided, with regard to the passage of the Public Service Bill, that the AWAs and the Office of the Employment Advocate were not doing such a terrific job for public servants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I give notice at this stage that the opposition will consider drafting a return to order with regard to AWAs that have already been approved in the Public Service to ascertain whether or not the Democrats are correct in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their assessment. As far as we are concerned, this goes directly to the shroud of secrecy surrounding the activities of the Employment Advocate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I would like to make is that this industrial relations regimen that has been carried in the parliament with the support of the Democrats, and reaffirmed again today, is leading to the type of activity which was revealed in the House of Representatives today with regard to what can only be described as industrial mercenaries being trained in Dubai. I understand they are ready to fly out tonight in order to replace workers on the waterfront. This would not have been possible under the previous government's industrial relations policy. It is possible under this government's industrial relations policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the Democrats: let us keep a very close eye on that. I also flag with them, in relation to a final admission that the role of the Employment Advocate and AWAs are not appropriate for the Public Service, that we would like to see the colour of their money in relation to looking at what those AWAs were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We reiterate our view that we find it quite bizarre that a bill that was produced as being a technical bill has, all of a sudden, become so controversial that a number of schedules have been excised. I would like a further explanation from the parliamentary secretary&mdash;other than the fact that the Democrats think we should do it this way or that this is the best way we can get it through in order to satisfy Minister Reith before Christmas&mdash;as to precisely why this is no longer a technical bill and why, all of a sudden, it has become controversial and these schedules have been withdrawn.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the parliamentary secretary replies, a number of points have been made my colleague Senator Mackay which need to be picked up. The first is that the technical amendments which will now be allowed to go through do marginally improve the operation of the bill. There is nothing in it for the Labor Party; there is nothing in it for the Democrats; there is something in it for the administration of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10276">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be quite apparent to you that we intend to insist on the amendments that we agreed to, which were made by both yourselves and ourselves. In the meantime that process would put at some risk a series of technical amendments which we think need to be advanced. We recognise that the government is going to bring forward a policy bill next year as opposed to a specifically technical bill. That policy bill relates to superannuation. I am sure that both Labor and ourselves will look forward to addressing these policy issues with that policy bill.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3M6">Senator MURRAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that has already been signalled in the lower house. With regard to your remarks about the Dubai matter, I would appreciate a briefing note from you because it is the first I have heard of it. That would be helpful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the AWAs, as Senator Mackay knows, I have consistently advised both her and the government that we are quite happy to recommend a principle whereby a representative sample of AWAs, appropriately protected from a privacy point of view, is made available for examination. That has been my consistent opinion, and I remain with that opinion. The second point with regard to the AWAs is that we regard the public sector and the private sector as quite different. Accordingly, the Democrats treated them differently with regard to the Parliamentary Service Bill. As you know, the public sector is a monopoly employer. The accountability, ethos, method of management and the service nature, as opposed to the profit nature, of the public sector have particular characteristics that occasioned our views on it. I know that you like those views. You would really like to see them extended a little further into other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last area you made a remark about was how we said that the Employment Advocate is doing a sterling job. I do not think we quite used that phrase; that is your version of our position. We continue to say that the Employment Advocate institution is a new one. It was really only established in April this year. It is our firm belief that it needs to be given 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a thorough tryout before the Senate or anyone else decides whether it should be knocked over. I know that we differ from you on that, but that is our position.</PARA></SPEECH>

It would not have been controversial if there had not been a range of other amendments which had made it controversial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have pragmatically decided that there are a lot of other sensible, technical matters which will improve the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day operation of the workplace relations legislation as it affects thousands of Australians across the country. I know that many of the technical amendments are supported broadly from all groups, including the ACTU and its affiliates, and that most people involved in this debate recognise that that is the fact. We have decided, as Senator Murray said, to ensure that the divisions which have been affected by controversial matters that are not of a technical nature but are clearly of a broader policy nature can be dealt with in this other way. That is why the government has decided to proceed down this track, which is to ensure that the sensible, non-controversial matters can get into place as quickly as possible.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition opposes the government's request and does so for a number of very good reasons. First of all, I express my disappointment at the fact that the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R152">Legislative Instruments Bill 1996</XREF> is back here today and of course in the manner in which it is back before us today. In terms of its broad thrust, the bill is not a contentious one for it is in many ways identical to the bill that the Labor government introduced into the previous parliament. Its enactment is a common goal of just about everybody in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, when we last debated the issues arising out of this bill the Senate made what I and I am sure all non-government members considered as some highly constructive amendments, amendments designed to enhance both parliamentary scrutiny of the process of making legislative instruments and the transparency of such scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legislative instruments are, it goes without saying, an exercise of the legislative power of the Commonwealth. It follows that it must be the parliament, not the executive, that has the ultimate say and control over the making of these instruments. However, this government is refusing to accept the Senate's amendments on the basis that it, the executive, has the right to determine these matters. This is the height of arrogance and this sort of approach is simply unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators will note, and I am sure they have noted, that the government has failed to pick up one single amendment moved by non-government senators. Let me repeat: not one of the amendments moved by non&hyphen;government senators has been accepted. This includes what I would have thought were the most inoffensive of the amendments which required legislative instruments not to use sexist language. The bottom line is that the government really has not treated this process seriously.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As senators will remember, during the debate on the bill we all indicated to the government in respect of a number of its amendments, for instance, those dealing with sunsetting, that we were prepared to consider alternative solutions to the same problem. Nonetheless, we expressed our grave and genuine concern at the models proposed by the government. In particular, we were concerned and we noted how the model of the government could be abused by the government of the day to vacate the field of regulation in any particular area. In further discussions between my office and that of the Attorney, the government indicated that it may be possible to modify the legislation by way of accommodating the Senate's concerns. However, we have seen no proposal of the government to adopt any alternative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My office also went to the extent of indicating a willingness on our part to further discuss a range of other matters with the government in the hope of reaching a compromise. Those offers have been ignored. The result is that we have to consider a message in the Senate today. For some reason, it is an important matter that needs to be dealt with before we go home for Christmas. I still cannot understand why the government would not take a bit more time to get serious about this particular piece of legislation. It is amazing to even contemplate that the government may want to go to the Governor&hyphen;General and have a double dissolution on the  Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 . This could turn out to be another one of those triggers. It would be great fun trying to explain to the public night after night what the  Legislative Instruments Bill 1996  amounts to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to ask: why has the government not treated this seriously, why have they brought it back today, why have they not taken more time to consider it? The message we received today is essentially a bald insult to the Senate and totally contrary to the spirit of cooperative legislative practice that I am not sure the government believes is desirable but that the rest of us believe is desirable. Rather than constructively respond to our concerns, they have simply thrown our concerns back at us. They have not even pro 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10288"> posed to consider the message in parts as it applies to different subject headings and amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have the situation where if we reject this message from the House on a bill that is in essence non&hyphen;contentious and that the electorate knows very little about we will have created the first precondition for a double dissolution election. Why is the government approaching this in such an unconstructive way? It could very well be that they want to build up as many triggers as possible. Maybe they feel that the Wik legislation passing this parliament with minor amendment in itself may not be sufficient so they want to build up the repository.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who is to blame for this? Some would say that you should blame the Attorney&hyphen;General totally. Others would say you should blame the cabinet. Others would say that you should blame the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I do not blame any one of them individually, but I blame them collectively. It has to have been a combination of those three different elements in the process. For this particular exercise, I do not include the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney should have fought harder for a compromise. The responsibility does start with him in this particular process. He could have shown a bit of goodwill. We were prepared, for instance, to defer a couple of issues and to put the government on notice that we wanted the government to come up with alternatives because we were of a view that although what they were proposing was not good enough the alternatives proposed by the Greens, the Democrats and Senator Harradine had problems also. The Attorney could have spent a bit of time constructively looking at the thoughts and the views of senators and see whether he could steer a course through it. But he has not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other concern I have with the Attorney is that, once again, we find he has glossed over the truth and, in this  particular instance, has lied about something in a speech to the House. I do make that assertion lightly, but let us look at the facts.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will withdraw. Let me point you to the facts. The Attorney is on the record as saying in the House that he did not know of the Labor Party's position on this bill before the bill was debated in the Senate. Firstly, let me say that this is factually incorrect as we delivered to the government our amendments to the bill some days before the bill was debated. How on earth could they have actually made a considered assessment of our 23 amendments and presented it to the Senate had they not known about our position before the bill was debated. They knew about it. We had provided it to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, his assertion ignores the fact that his previous adviser on this matter had been approached by my office on a number of occasions prior to the debate to discuss the Labor Party's concerns. Unfortunately, the adviser chose not to avail himself of those opportunities. That, I suppose, best summarises the approach the government has taken in respect of this issue. They have not been interested in the Senate's responses and they have dismissed them without any constructive dialogue or application to what we are putting up. The Attorney could not have rightly said to the House of Representatives that he did not know of our position on this bill before the bill was debated in the Senate. He did know and the invitation was there for him and his office to find out more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have to confront the government's response. Let me say that I do not think the response is anywhere near good enough. I could try to encourage Senator Vanstone to suspend debate on this matter and give the Attorney a bit more time to consider it. This is an Attorney who takes a lot of time to consider most things. In fact, you could say that he takes a lot of time to consider everything, but this particular proposal. When it comes to appointments, decisions he has to take, chasing Christopher Skase, chasing `Dolly' Dunn, the Attorney is somewhere lost behind the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10289"> pack wondering what is going on. He is a slow mover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this particular case someone has said to him, `You had better respond to this before Christmas because we might be short of a trigger.' We actually think that the Senate deserves a bit more recognition of its views than that. We also think that this response is premature, inadequate and one that we cannot live with. Unfortunately, Senator Vanstone the opposition cannot live with your request and I hope the Senate cannot either.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R152">Legislative Instruments Bill 1996</XREF> , the Australian Democrats emphasised that the key component of the rule of law is accessibility to those rules, consistency in their application, and transparency and control over their development. We also believe that a strong obligation integral to a fair and democratic society is that people should not be disfranchised by the language we use in the laws that we enact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bolkus began his remarks by drawing attention to the gender issue. Despite the attempt by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his `get on with it' speech concerning the present native title debate, implicit in his message was the negating of the important role that the Senate has in reviewing and improving the legislative process in this country. It is also important for the maintenance of public confidence in our public institutions to ensure that law making is legitimate and accountable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to concur with what Senator Bolkus has said in the chamber. If the Senate rejects this bill, we will be in the extraordinary position of having as part of a double dissolution trigger a bill that has multiparty support. Imagine a double dissolution over legislative instruments. Whilst some people are quite rightly concerned at the prospect of a race election, an election over paper would be preposterous. But that is not what is really going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along with the  Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 &mdash;otherwise known as the unfair dismissals or the right to sack workers unfairly bill&mdash;I believe that the gov 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ernment is developing a cache of bills to mask its real intent in this matter; that is, to have a race election in this country. Is the government attempting to provide a legislative shield to provide an excuse for its real agenda&mdash;an election over Wik? Is it trying to have a whole series of bills it can claim it was having a double dissolution over? I do not know. I get lost with its strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear from the message sent to us from the House of Representatives that the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) has not accepted the amendments made by the non-government parties in the Senate. I want to have a closer look at what he has rejected. Among the amendments either sponsored or supported by the Australian Democrats was the removal of gender biased language. I want to draw attention to a pattern that is developing with the Attorney-General in dealing with the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine, who is not known for pillorying members of the government, said quite strongly the other day that he felt that the Attorney-General had misled the Senate with regard to matters that Senator Harradine felt strongly about. I have had occasion to write to the Attorney-General and have not received timely replies when it was necessary. I have had occasion to remark upon that in the Senate. Here we have a situation where the Senate has advised the Attorney-General of its opinion and the Attorney-General has just dismissed it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the nature of the amendments which went through on the  Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 . There were 18 government amendments passed&mdash;you will note that there are 18 amendments approved by the House. There were 26 opposition amendments passed, five Democrat amendments passed, three Greens (WA) amendments passed and one amendment from Senator Harradine passed. There were four government amendments negatived, two government amendments withdrawn, five Democrat amendments withdrawn, one part negatived and one clause negatived. The point I want to make is that, out of 53 amendments, the government could accept only 18, and those are their 18.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10290">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is so wise and so clever in everything that, when it comes into a house where it has not got the numbers, where people are able to express a differing point of view, it is incapable of accepting any&mdash;not even one&mdash;of the amendments put to it in this very important matter. Maybe it reflects a type of mind&mdash;an adversarial, aggressively obstinate mind&mdash;of the government. Maybe it reflects an inability to take a dispassionate and considerate kind of approach. Maybe it even reflects incompetence. I thought this was extraordinary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us talk about the gender issues. The very same gender amendments were passed in the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1997. In that bill, 83 Democrat amendments were passed, all relating to the gender issue. The same government which is rejecting those gender amendments in the  Legislative Instruments Bill 1996  not only accepted them and assented to them in the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1997 but also asked the Governor-General to put them into law. So the gender amendments it will not accept in its legislative instruments have been accepted under the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1997, which amended numerous acts, including the Acts Interpretation Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is going on here? Have we got a right and a left wing of the government? Have we got right and left factions? Don't you each know what you are doing? The Acts Interpretation Act says as a result of the Democrat amendments that there will be no sexist language used in the drafting and the carriage of government legislation. In this legislation, you are turning it down. I think it is embarrassing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney-General has also rejected the reviewability of Attorney&hyphen;General certificates exempting some procedures from parliamentary scrutiny. In the House of Representatives he said that the amendments to this bill appear to have been generated in an ad hoc and unprepared way. That is a comment I suggest is both unworthy and untruthful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true, as the minister well knows&mdash;and, Senator Vanstone, you stand here in his 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> place&mdash;that at times the Senate is not an all seeing and all wise body. But that particular debate on legislative instruments&mdash;and I have been involved in many debates now in this house&mdash;was one of the best and most informed debates that I have been a party to in the Senate. The government representative of the day conducted himself particularly well. I think the remarks made by the Attorney-General are gratuitous and do not do him credit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policies in the amendments moved and supported were the result of great consideration. The assertion by the Attorney that there was no coordination in the work that was done by the Labor Party, the Greens (WA), the Democrats and Senator Harradine is most unfortunate. Some of the amendments which were pursued were recommendations of the National Party whip and the committee chair on those matters, Senator O'Chee, who is particularly capable and well informed in this area of regulations, ordinances and legislative instruments. All amendments were circulated according to Senate procedure and the matters, in my view, were fully considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not annoyed, Minister, because the government does not see fit to accept all the Senate's amendments but I am astonished that it cannot accept any but its own amendments. It will only accept 18 of the 53 amendments. I am astonished that it cannot accept amendments which have already been accepted in other bills. And I am astonished that the Attorney-General would have the view that this was less than an informed debate. If he or his adviser had been through <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, he would have seen that the parties, at large, complimented the government for bringing the bill forward and for the bill's general intent. It was, after all, only 53 amendments to a very significant bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, this is one of the most significant bills you have produced in your two years in government. Minister Vanstone, I appreciate that you are standing here in someone's else's stead in this instance, but I must advise you that the Democrats will insist on all the amendments to the  Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 .</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a number of comments in response to the remarks made by Senator Bolkus and by Senator Murray on behalf of the Democrats. Can I first turn to some of the remarks that Senator Murray made because he may need to leave the chamber. Just as a courtesy, I will make them while he is here. Senator Murray made the suggestion on a number of occasions that he has divined, by whatever process he chooses, that the government is determined to go to a double dissolution election, which he defines as being on race. Senator Murray, it has been my assessment&mdash;it is only a personal assessment which does not count for much, because there are so many of us here; we each have different assessments that we make&mdash;that on no other occasion have I heard you reduce yourself to what I regard to be cheap political point scoring. But, on this matter, I have to point out with regret that that is my assessment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the native title legislation were to be the subject of a double dissolution and were there to be discussion of the legislation during an election, it would be the government's intention that the discussion be focused on what the bill is about, and that is, land title in Australia. It is a matter of great regret to me that, over the 13 years I have been in parliament, the only people who have up until this occasion&mdash;except former Senator Kernot perhaps&mdash;sought to play what is lightly referred to as `the race card' were members of the Labor Party&mdash;and now the Democrats have joined them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since we are offering political views that relate to whether the government is genuine&mdash;I think that is Senator Murray's assertion in response to this bill. Senator Murray seems to be implying that the government is not genuine and is almost asking for the bill to be rejected, he says, to disguise a covert plan. I think that merits an appropriate response. I invite him to look through whatever records he chooses&mdash;I could be wrong; perhaps someone else has&mdash;because it seems to me that, rather than dealing with the substance of bills which I accept is more often the case in this chamber than in the other, on this occa 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sion the Labor Party has sought to define the public debate as being one of race.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very easy thing to do. You just march outside and you say, `This is a racist bill. Those people are racists.' You define the political question as to whether the party to whom you are pointing is a racist party. Don't go to the details of the bill, don't go to the question of native title and don't go to the mess of the native title legislation&mdash;that your predecessors supported, Senator Murray&mdash;which needs to be cleaned up, just win the public debate by a little 16-second grab that will easily fit on the news by saying, `These people are racists.' It is not my view that that level of debate does politics in Australia at large any merit, nor this chamber, nor you&mdash;but that is for you to choose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Your contribution, Senator Murray, invites a response that, just as you may find it unusual that the government wants to accept its own amendments and not yours, it is a simple fact that debate in this place is to persuade and cajole. I understand it was a very useful debate. I think I recall under the previous government participating on this bill in an earlier format.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all agree this is a very important move. But it does not follow that, because someone does not like your views, they are adversarial, obstinate and have an inability to be dispassionate about things. If you are seriously convinced that people who reject your views in total must be adversarial, obstinate or lack some capacity to be dispassionate, you might need help from someone whose professional skills I do not have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Much has been made in the limited debate we have had in relation to the suggested gender amendments. If I were a normal citizen at home listening to Senator Bolkus and listening to you, I might think that this government was determined to have gender specific legislation. I might have been led to believe that because, as you know, one can deceive by omission just as one can deceive by an overt misstatement of the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray, I therefore choose to put on the record that the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of Legislative Drafting have both had a confirmed policy since 1984, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10292"> which has not been changed by this government, to have gender neutral legislation unless the specific circumstance warrants gender specifics being used. There is no suggestion of that being changed. It has, as I am advised, been in place since 1984, and remarks of previous senators, therefore, need to be considered in that respect. This government supports that policy. It was introduced by the previous government and it is supported by this one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray, you referred to Senator Harradine's expressed views on the Attorney, which I have had the opportunity to hear before from Senator Harradine. Senator Harradine basically thinks he was misled. I just invite you to consider this: as I understood your contribution, you were saying to the chamber, in relation to the gender amendments, words almost like `exactly the same amendments in relation to the Acts Interpretation Act'. I think that is what you said. As I am advised, they are quite different. They both relate to gender, but they are in fact different. They are not the same amendments at all. As minor a point as that is, it does highlight how careful we have to be if we want to assert that someone else is not telling the truth. It is the old case of people in glass houses, I suppose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to what I think we all agree on. Most of us here understand that it is substantive legislation that, generally speaking, sets a policy direction, and it is delegated legislation which is more likely than not going to be what affects most Australians&mdash;other than criminal law. Most Australians will be caught, to the extent that they are, or inconvenienced or put out, by some delegated legislation that comes from the primary legislation. That does not, perhaps, get the attention and publicity it deserves because it is a net to trap citizens, if you like, a risk they run if they do not know the law, just as much as the primary legislation is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason, there is substantial agreement here and in the other place that this bill will be a marked improvement for parliament's control of that subordinate legislation. That agreement, fortunately, transcends party politics. The bill, and its forerunner by the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> previous government&mdash;that I think, as I said, I did contribute to the debate on&mdash;has been considered by a number of parliamentary committees and reflects a large number of suggestions for improvement made by those committees. That is important to mention so as to clarify for people that the Attorney has not taken this matter lightly. No&hyphen;one has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has been a very long time in the making and has had a very wide canvassing, with an enormous range of people having the opportunity to put their views in. There is a little bit of foot stamping at the moment because some final amendments sought by the Democrats and the opposition are not going to be accepted. But let us not for one minute let the refusal to accept those amendments cast an incorrect shade over the entire bill, which has been a long time in the making on both sides of this chamber. It is agreed that our control of delegated legislation and a citizen's capacity to understand what laws are there affecting them would be greatly enhanced if the bill was passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The registration provisions in the bill ensure that persons and bodies that would be affected by delegated legislation have the capacity to access that legislation before it applies to them. The tying of enforceability to registration of the instruments&mdash;so that an instrument cannot be made by someone, slipped in the bottom of a drawer and Joe or Josephine Citizen not know that this regulation has been made that is going to affect them&mdash;will greatly enhance a citizen's opportunity to understand what laws would be affecting them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe the requirement for mandatory consultation for instruments will ensure that any future delegated legislation is both necessary and relevant. There has been an exponential increase, an explosion, of this delegated legislation that hardly ever sees the media light shone upon it and, therefore, hardly ever comes to the attention of citizens until they are affected by it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sunset provisions in here will ensure that unnecessary delegated legislation is removed from the need for compliance at the earliest possible time. The consultation pro cess is now uniform. Everybody will know 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10293"> what is required, and the public will have a proper chance of making their views known. To date, the multiplicity of different procedures has bred public confusion and a reluctance by many of the public to comment on the proposals. They are locked out of the opportunity to participate in, and comment on, delegated legislation that will affect them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The procedures adopted are those that were agreed several years ago by COAG. They are used for intergovernmental schemes and by many of the states for their own domestic purposes. The changes suggested by the Senate would create difficulties for intergovernmental schemes and would require reconsideration by COAG of their processes. That issue, of course, will arise in the review of the policy and operation of the bill pursuant to clause 72.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliament's power to scrutinise delegated legislation has now been considerably enhanced. Instruments are being lodged with parliament sooner. The explanatory statement to be lodged with every instrument will provide a vast amount of additional material that has not previously been made available for consideration by parliament. Instead of relying on undertakings to amend provisions, which parliament finds unsatisfactory, and which are frequently not promptly satisfied, the bill provides for a short deferral of disallowance of an unsatisfactory instrument to enable the rule maker to correct an identified deficiency. The government says that the drafting concerns raised in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Clearer Commonwealth law</EMPHASIS> are met by this bill. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Can I conclude by coming back briefly to the remarks made by Senator Murray, at the commmencement of his contribution, basically seeking to impute to the government a motive in relation to this bill that the government was somehow determined to ensure that this bill would not be passed to give it a second or third trigger for a double dissolution. So the government, in Senator Murray's view, could hide a covert determination to have a double dissolution on native title legislation, which 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator Murray chose to describe as being `an election on race'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does bear repeating that, in the 13 years I have been here, the only parties that have raised the issue of race, called someone else racist, played the racist card, have been the Labor Party and the Democrats. They are the ones that have inflamed issues and sought, in my view, to set one citizen against another&mdash;in other words, to capture a particular vote for themselves. They have mercilessly done it on every possible occasion they could. I take the opportunity to say that it does not reflect well on debate in this parliament, in this chamber or on Senator Murray himself.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Minister, for your response. I am aware of your own political leanings and your stance on moral matters. I am glad you have stated it is not your intention to have an election based on race. I would expect nothing less from you personally. I would also remind you for the record that I did not use the word `racist'. I am of the opinion that it is probable that, amongst the 224 parliamentarians here, there may well be racists, but I do not believe that your government is a racist government. I certainly do not believe that you, Minister, are racist. I know you to be very much not so. But what I and many others in this country are concerned about is that the native title debate, if it went to a double dissolution, could degenerate into an election about race. Let me make it clear that neither you nor your government are characterised by me or my party as racist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the gender amendments you draw attention to, I point out that Democrats amendments Nos 5, 22 and 25 require the Principal Legislative Counsel to ensure that legislative instruments are not drafted with gender specific language, as defined by amendment No. 1, unless there is a specific need to identify persons by their sex. You will appreciate that that amendment is putting into law the draftsperson's instructions. Your government's opinion is that that is unnecessary, and that is what your rejection is saying, but your government's opinion is not that it is wrong, because you yourself just said that it is correct. All we have sought to do is put 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10294"> it into law because your government and your particular opinion may not prevail at some future time. That is our intention. So I make it clear that we are in agreement with the instructions to the parliamentary draftspersons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The strength of my remarks really relate to the response of the government. I want to draw your attention again to the fact that 35 amendments came through from all the other parties. Only five of ours were passed. Of the remaining 30, 26 were submitted by the opposition, three by the Greens (WA) and one by Senator Harradine. You heard me say that we would insist on all of them, so it is not just that we were determined that ours go through. We felt that the whole package of amendments were well considered, well debated and well argued at length. We do find it extraordinary&mdash;I do find it extraordinary&mdash;that the government cannot see fit to accept any of those. It is not possible that we are wrong on every single one. You think so, obviously, but it does seem an extraordinary response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am searching for here is a way of dealing with the matter, which does not seem capable of parliamentary compromise, especially where the issues are not absolutely fundamental to issues of philosophy or ideology or policy on your part. For you simply to say that it is unnecessary is not good enough if it does not harm the bill and in fact advances the bill in the opinion of the Senate. That informs my remarks. Minister, I appreciate the strength and nature of your response. I appreciate your remarks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We might set up a mutual thanking society, Senator Murray, because I thank you for your response and for putting your remarks on the record. I think that is very helpful in the context of the political climate&mdash;shall I say&mdash;at the moment that some would let themselves fall into.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the gender amendments, what you say is right. You want to put into law something that has been government policy 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> under the previous government and is still policy under this government. You say that if it does no harm, then we're churlish, obstinate and refusing to be dispassionate in saying, `Yes, okay, if that's what you would prefer.' But I could equally say to you, `Why don't we save the charges of churlishness, obstinance and refusal to be dispassionate for something where we actually disagree,' because, in substance, we do agree. The policy that you want followed is being followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many a long argument has been had by parliamentarians, lawyers and interested parties in law reform as to when you should put something in a statute and when you should not and the sorts of ways you should put things in statutes. You would be familiar with the questions many people ask lawyers: are you a black&hyphen;letter law person or legislator? Do you think everything should be spelt out in black and white or should there be a return to embodying principles and allowing law courts to interpret them? Another question up is: should laws be passed even though you might have enormous hesitation about the capacity to implement them? Some people would say that the law should be passed anyway because it serves an educative purpose. It makes a statement about what the parliament thinks, and that is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then you have other people who say, `We like you people, you do a good job for us as politicians, generally speaking, but have a look at what you are doing: you must judge your merits by sticking another law on the statute books.' They do not want this proliferation of legislation and delegation mounting up and up so that people here can go home and say, `Oh, I had a bill passed today,' and then stick a clause in here and another clause in there. Some people would say, `Don't do that unless you are going to change something for the better.' If you accept that point of view, it is not churlish, obstinate or refusing to be dispassionate to say that there is no need for that; it's happening. We do not need to put in legislation that requires us to do what we have been doing for over a decade. We can leave that piece out. In a sense, it is not worth fighting over something that you 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10295"> agree about, Senator Murray, and I think that is the situation that we now find ourselves in.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, it would be helpful to the debate if you were able to indicate which of these amendments you reject, which amendments the government feels particularly strongly about. It is apparent from the discussion that you do not feel particularly strongly about the gender matters because you agree with us. You just disagree as to whether it should be in the bill. But there are other areas of discussion here which I think you regard as really attacking the intent of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key matters was the sunset clause. The sunset clause matter had its attractions, as you know, because it gave the opportunity to clean up a lot of outdated regulations that had been on the books for a long time. But it was the opinion of the Senate, after a very considerable debate, that it also posed the danger of the government of the day turfing out a series of regulations which were very helpful on social and employment matters, for instance, or community or environment matters, which the community as a whole valued and the government of the day might not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it was that fear that could not be allayed in the debate&mdash;and the government did not have a mechanism for dealing with the fear that the five&hyphen;year sunset clause would just allow a lot of stuff to be turfed out that we could never see again. I wonder if, in bringing the bill back to the Senate, the government has found a means of expressing an opinion in that area and will inform us of how to deal with that situation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Murray, I was actually seeking some advice while you were speaking, so I may have only got a proportion of what you said and I hope I have not got it wrong. If I understood your contribution in respect of sunset clauses, you were concerned that at the expiration of that time there might be a sort of vacating of the field. There are two things that come to mind now to say in respect of that; there are probably many more. One is that there are many who adopt a very strong view that there ought 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to be sunset clauses in all delegated legislation&mdash;and some would even say in primary legislation&mdash;because it forces parliament to reconsider whether things are necessary. Many would argue that is why we have got the multiplicity of laws that we have got that need updating, because in the past people put another bill on the pile and never went back and had another look at it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One mechanism to ensure that parliament does its job and cleans up the legislation and delegated legislation is to have sunset clauses to make us do our job; one that does not give us the opportunity to do it when there is a politically convenient environment in which we choose at our discretion and indulgence, but which actually says to parliament, `You are going to have to do these things in an ordered and considered way and you are going to have to turn your collective mind to this matter again on this date.' There are other arguments&mdash;I understand. But it is obviously the responsibility of parliament, when something is still needed, to put it back in its existing form. When it needs to be, or could benefit from being revamped, revamp it and put it back. When it is no longer necessary, get it off the books and keep our legislation clean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Can I briefly indicate that, in relation to one set of amendments, there were some remarks that Senator Bolkus made in relation to the government's desire to retain power in the executive and to not listen to parliament. If you were listening to Senator Bolkus, you would have perhaps got that impression. There are currently some areas of instruments which are exempted from parliamentary disallowance. Some examples include quarantine proclamations, some migration instruments and some specific instruments under the Public Service Act relating to terms and conditions of employment. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these matters have not, either now or for a considerable time, been subject to disallowance. For a long time they have been matters for the executive. You elect a government to govern and its new policy proposals and legislation, in that sense, of course need to be considered, but there is a balance to be found between having a government that governs 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10296"> and a parliament that keeps a check on it and allowing a government to govern. We say that the status quo&mdash;the one Labor has used for a long time and that has been in place&mdash;is the proper balance. If, in the end, ministers cannot make decisions without coming back to parliament on everything, why would you bother having ministers? Why don't we just have a collective talkfest?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Murray interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Murray laughs. He might think that is a good idea since the Democrats are a long way off winning a large enough number of seats in the lower house to win government. We have this system where there are checks and balances. We have departments who serve the government of the day. We have ministers who are paid to take the flak, if you like, and make decisions. Some of those decisions, they are not free to make without parliament approving.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments you want, Senator Murray, seek to make subject to parliamentary disallowance decisions that have not for a long time been in that position, and they would make it very difficult to govern in relation to those areas if they were. Senator Murray, you would have been here on occasions when the political climate hots up either in the nation at large or in this chamber. As we head towards the end of a session, quite often this happens, and I think the colloquial expression is that a bit of dummy spitting goes on. When you have things like quarantine proclamations and migration instruments, it is not appropriate that you take them away from the executive and say, `We the parliament&mdash;the people who have not been elected to govern&mdash;will take over that role and tell the ministers what they can and can't do.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fine balance. I am not suggesting for one minute&mdash;and I am sure you understand this&mdash;that because a government is elected to govern, it should be able to do what it likes and you should pass every bill we want. It is not a clear-cut matter to simply say, `Parliament would like to disallow that so ministers will not be able to make that decision.' If you keep going on, as I say, you will have no decision making capacity to give to a minis 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ter. You will just have people who sit there and get paid more, which is a ludicrous situation to be in. It is a balance to be found and we argue in that case that the existing situation&mdash;the status quo that you want to change&mdash;is the appropriate balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor found it to be the appropriate balance when it was in government. While I am not a betting person, I am prepared to bet this. This bill will eventually be passed without the amendments you want&mdash;so that migration instruments, quarantine proclamations, certain matters under the Public Service Act, et cetera, are not subject to disallowance. If you manage to stay here long enough and I manage to stay here long enough&mdash;and I think it will be a fair while&mdash;eventually Labor will get back into government. I am almost prepared to let you nominate your prize if you then move an amendment to have these adopted under the  Legislative Instruments Bill  and a then Labor government accepts it, because it will not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I accept the bona fides of your position, Senator Murray, and of the Democrats, we have seen all too often from the people who are now in opposition that the things they said they believed in when in government, they now say they do not believe in. When they were in government, this practice was a suitable balance. Now they are not in government, they do not think it is. Years and years ago, they thought privatisation was a shocking thing. Then when they were in government, they sold the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas and the Australian National Line. They were not going to sell the rest of the Commonwealth Bank, as I recall, and then decided they would anyway.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to my remarks I circulated to the Senate sheet 684 which is marked `revised 2'. Like other members of the Senate I feel that this debate has been sprung on me. We had thought that native title would be proceeding, so I ask in advance for your forbearance as we proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We come back to this bill with a need for a decision on the issue of whether we are to retain Labor's Industry Commission unchanged or whether we are to have the coalition's Productivity Commission as considerably changed by the Senate. As you will recall, the second reading and the entire debate&mdash;and, Senator Cook, you were not the main Labor exponent on that day in that debate&mdash;were well informed, because the varying philosophies and positions of the various parties in the Senate were exceptionally well expressed. But there was a great deal of agreement, despite our different philosophies and opinions. There were very real concerns that the Greens (WA) and the Democrats in particular had about the Industry Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was agreement by all non&hyphen;government parties for substantial amendments to the government's bill. I must say that the government was remarkably obliging in according agreement to or in facilitating a number of those amendments and a number of those intentions&mdash;which was appreciated by the Senate at the time and recorded as such. It caused the Democrats to move away from their position of seeking to reject the bill outright, because in its form then we believed it merely substituted bad for bad to a position where we could see that it was a markedly improved institution, albeit still sitting within the framework of what people on the progressive side of politics would refer to as economic fundamentalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, knowing that the alternative to change would be that we would be stuck with Labor's Industry Commission, which&mdash;with the greatest of respect, Senator Cook&mdash;has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> seen its use&hyphen;by date, we would hope that the Productivity Commission in terms of the very heavily amended bill would in fact be an improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The improvements had been made primarily in terms of management and control. First, no longer would the chair have almost authoritarian control over the other 11 members. Second, the members of that commission would be drawn from what we considered a more balanced and a wider grouping. Third, the commission in its terms of reference would be required to review industry matters but with specific regard as well to social, community, environmental and other matters which are very much in the hearts of many members of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Democrats we then went to government and said, `Look. If you would consider the possibilities of a few other changes, we would be prepared to support giving your new Productivity Commission a go, even though we do not like its politics or its ideology or its management&mdash;not in their persons but in the execution of their duties. The outcome is that we would prefer an improved body.' The government's reaction was that it would be prepared to reopen the debate. In consequence we have the Productivity Commission Bill back before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I then went away with my adviser and developed an approach that I put before you in terms of sheet 684, revised 2. Because this debate was sprung upon us I had no chance to discuss with the clerks the appropriate running sheet or how this should be dealt with. I would take advice from the main parties in the Senate. I can move the entire package together, if it is your wish, or I can deal with them separately or in parcels. Perhaps I should stop there and ask if there is any indication. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(5.44 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was listening intently to Senator Murray's explanation as to what we are now debating. I am not quite sure that he has completed that explanation. But from the point of view of the Australian Labor Party, the opposition in this chamber, my understanding of where we have reached is that the committee stages of this bill are all but 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10299"> complete and, in the normal course, the next issue before the chamber would be the report of the committee being adopted. But rather than proceed to that matter, what is being proposed is that we consider some further amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note for the record Senator Murray's nod at that remark and I take that to be an indication that I have correctly summarised that point. Revised sheet 2, No. 684, represents those new amendments that are to be proposed. I also express this view to the minister: my understanding, by and large, is that the government would propose to support the amendments that the Democrats are proposing to move. I note that the minister has nodded and I take that to be an indication that they do so intend, which would indicate to anyone in this chamber that the numbers are such that, should we commit the Democrat's proposals, they would be carried.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the point of view of the opposition, that causes me to have to consider the nature of these amendments&mdash;as to whether we would support what is an unusual consensus between the Democrats and the government or whether we should oppose it. Looking at some of these amendments, the first comment I make is that I, like Senator Murray, was caught somewhat by surprise at the speed with which this matter has come before the chamber. I was innocently conducting my day's appointments when I got a tap on the shoulder and was told to go into the chamber immediately because this matter was coming on for debate. I, like others in this place, anticipated that the Wik legislation would continue to be considered, but at the moment that has been suspended so that we can deal with this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So my first point is that I have not had very much notice of this debate. My second point is that I am not quite sure of all the significant variations in the amendments that are being proposed by the Democrats and the government over what already has been amended in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to both the minister and Senator Murray that I would appreciate an explanation of what the differences are and where they lie. I think the chamber, irrespective of wheth 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> er there is an agreement between two parties here, is entitled to such an explanation and not just to an approach of saying, `Because we've got the numbers, we'll push it through.' I do think there is a place here for some explanation of what the differences are and what the significance might be to enable the rest of us who are not party to this deal to be able to express a considered view about them. This is the place in which those views are expressed and I would anticipate that it is the intention of the government and the Democrats to provide us with that opportunity. That would follow their explanation of what those alterations are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at this in a plain reading, without the time to digest what might be the hidden traps in the drafting or the devil which might lurk deeply in the detail, it seems to me that some of these are re&hyphen;wordings of amendments moved successfully here by the Labor Party or they are re&hyphen;wordings of clauses that the Labor Party sought to move in the committee stage. It is interesting that our theme should be taken on board, although not in the detail that we would like to apply it. Mr Temporary Chairman, I make those explanations at this stage and indicate that I am seeking guidance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate very much the remarks of my colleague Senator Murray from the Australian Democrats about the elevated nature and considered tone of the debate when this matter was last before the chamber. Indeed, he is right; at the time I was not the shadow minister with carriage of this matter. But I think my colleague the former shadow minister would endorse what I am about to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission is not something that is a direct substitute for what has been called here a moment ago Labor's Industry Commission. The Productivity Commission is not a swap. The Productivity Commission is a Howard government affectation which combines the Industry Commission, the Bureau of Industry Economics and the old EPAC&mdash;the Economic Planning Advisory Commission. That is, it is a combination of three different sources of economic analysis and advice to the government. In the first instance, by combining them to create 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10300"> one monolithic provider of economic advice for consideration to the government, you deny public sector advice to a government that is fearless, that contests the orthodoxy that some institutions hold as profoundly theirs. Speaking as a former minister in this place with carriage of industry policy for a number of years&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FORSHAW" NAMEID="656">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="656">Senator Forshaw</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And a good one, too.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Senator&mdash;can I say, having read Industry Commission reports, reports of the Bureau of Industry Economics and reports of EPAC, that the responsibilities of each of those three organisations were distinctly different, the quality and depth of the reporting varied, and the fact that they did not agree with each other was absolutely significant. When you are having to make government decisions, you need to know not just what the orthodox view is but what the other views are too. You need some sense of contest between those views in order to make reasoned and sensible decisions. By combining three contending organisations into one monolith, you produce a single stream of orthodoxy which does not have those variations, does not have that sense of contest and does not have, therefore, the institutional underpinning which a government needs in order to make sensible economic decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not talking about governance of a nation in just one small, insignificant area of the country. We are talking here about the centrality of the Australian economy and decisions that relate to the management of that economy. Being a non&hyphen;economist, I guess I can observe that economists themselves say that the distinctive feature of the profession of economics is that you can put all the economists in the world end on end and you will still never arrive at a conclusion. In other words, this is not a precise science; it is a science or a profession that involves different shades of meaning and originates from various value premises as to what the outcomes might be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a retrograde step to do what is being proposed here. I conclude my intervention at this point by re&hyphen;emphasising a point that I am sure my colleague the former shadow minister 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would have made abundantly clear. We are opposed to this piece of legislation. We are opposed to the concept of it. We believe that it is wrong. It weakens government and the right of Australians to know what the various differences of opinion are among economic institutions. It is not a matter of simply swapping the Productivity Commission with the Industry Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the subject of the Industry Commission, we have particular views about what might be necessary to reform it to make it a more effective organisation. The other organisations, EPAC and the BIE, have a particular advantage too. I wanted to make that point now so that, when we contend with the various amendments, it cannot be said that somehow we are supporting the Productivity Commission Bill; we are not. But since the bill will exist, we are trying to make the best of a bad job in trying to improve it. That is the purpose of our interventions in this debate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have now located revised sheet 366 and I see the terms of our original amendment. What appears to be the distinctive difference between the clause that is now 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> moved compared with the amendment we foreshadowed are the additional words `or might affect the productivity performance of industry, industry development or the productivity performance of the economy as a whole'. My understanding is that, in terms of the legal interpretation of these words, the additional words actually confine and limit the meaning of the clause rather than expand and broaden the meaning. Our words, which are `include legislative or administrative action taken, or to be taken, by the Commonwealth or a state or a territory', have to be guided only by the objectives of the bill or the act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware of Senator Cook's views and I suspect he is aware of my views of this matter. For example, the government takes advice from many sources. The Productivity Commission is one source of important

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder if I could be helpful to Senator Cook. Senator Cook, the original bill had sections 6(1)(a) to (h) and 6(2)(a) to (c) Your amendment, agreed by the Senate, replaced clause 6, page 4 (line 7) to page 5 (line 8), omit the clause; in other words, omitting nearly an entire page of the bill and substituting a much shorter clause. That short clause you agreed to had two parts to it&mdash;1(a) and (b), which the government and the Democrats are retaining, and 6(2), which we have expanded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the minister has used his language a little loosely here. It does not substitute the exact language which was used before in the functions of the commission in 6(1) and (2). It very much does not do that. It only adds what, from their point of view, they regard as an important confinement and from our point of view what we regard as relatively unexceptional. Senator Cook, you have retained the thrust of your intention and of your amend

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now I ask that for this reason. We have dealt with this bill, as has been pointed out by the minister and, by way of interjection, by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, for over a week. The change that is now being sought to be reversed is a Labor amendment that was carried during that debate. You are wanting, after a week's consideration of this bill, to come back, revisit it and knock out one of the changes that we had inserted. I think there is an obligation on the government to explain to the chamber why that is. I do not think it is fair to infer that we are being difficult because it is the government that wishes to change what the Senate has already decided. It is for that reason that I would like an explanation from the government. </PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might be helpful to remind the committee that amendment 334 relates to fast tracking and adds provisions for a streamlined procedure for the recognition of native title on Aboriginal reserves and other categories of land. It involves the identification of native title holders by rep bodies; the registration of the rep bodies finding in the Federal Court as a determination after notification and appeals; the protection of the interests of residents who are not native title holders and the protection of non&hyphen;indigenous interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 334 specifically includes fast track determinations, requirement for notification and the ability to appeal against findings. It actually gives a series of functions for fast tracking. It also includes areas which constitute a national park or reserve for conservation purposes and vacant crown land. Basically, 334 is a reworked provision and is quite detailed. It includes all of these areas which the National Indigenous Working Group agrees with the Democrats and the Greens should be included in the provisions of fast tracking.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to what I understand to be the revised ALP fast tracking amendment, which I think will pick up the arguments that relate to the Democrat amendment. So we are dealing with opposition amendment 359 and Democrat amendment 334.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the government's point of view, the problems I presented before about this fast tracking process remain. We still are concerned in a general sense about the considerable elevation of the role of representative bodies in this process, which is a delicate matter. While our amendments, generally speaking, do give greater authority, powers and functions to representative bodies, we believe the proposition entailed here potentially involves them in quasi&hyphen;determinations of native title which would be inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I read it, it is saying that if the representative body fulfils its fast tracking functions with no appeal within three months, the registrar must enter that certification conferring native title rights and, indeed, conferring exclusive possession. So we effectively have an administrative body&mdash;a representative body&mdash;by this process granting exclusive possession, which we believe not only is wrong in principle but remains a problem in the light of the Brandy decision. It is effectively a determination of the existence of native title. It is an exercise of judicial power and, on our reading of Brandy, cannot be performed by the representative body through the registrar in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On another level, we believe that granting this sort of role to representative bodies is wrong in principle. Rep bodies are there as an advocate for their clients&mdash;for native title holders. They cannot be advocate and judge, which is what this fast tracking proposition involves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have addressed this issue of so&hyphen;called fast tracking by the whole tenor of our amendments, by our agreements provisions, by the amendments we have prepared in relation to 47A and 47B about disregarding previous extinguishing acts where Aboriginal people are occupying vacant Crown land or 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Aboriginal reserves. We seek to facilitate this process, but we do not believe that we can support these amendments basically on two grounds: the conflict of interest involved in relation to the role of representative bodies, and the very dubious constitutional basis for this proposal, because we are effectively endowing rep bodies with a judicial function.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The importance of these amendments is manifold. I want to say that very firmly. They provide a mechanism whereby native title holders can obtain recognition of their native title via a streamlined process and avoid the protracted, drawn out procedures of disputed claims. These amendments are to facilitate non-controversial native title applications. Application for fast track recognition may occur on Aboriginal land and other categories of land such as vacant crown land, national parks and conservation reserves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present Native Title Act 1993 makes provision for land already controlled and/or owned by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to be effectively converted into native title land. Section 70 of the present Native Title Act 1993 permits the tribunal to make a determination of native title where such an application is unopposed. I note specifically that, due to the Brandy case, the tribunal will no longer be able to make such determinations. This will now be required to be done by the Federal Court. This is uncontroversial, but I mention it for the sake of completeness in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that the fast tracking provisions are not about bypassing procedures in the Native Title Act; they are about cutting through red tape where there is no controversy about a particular group's claim. Examples that come to mind are peoples who presently live in old missions who have been granted a form of title under state or territory legislation, such as the deed of grant in trust lands in Queensland, and now want to convert that land to native title. There is of course no right to negotiate under the fast tracking provisions and little reason for there to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example, and something I have been involved with personally a number of times, is old mission reserves on the outskirts 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10308"> of country towns in Queensland. I was involved in the handover of one of those reserves some years ago at Mitchell in south&hyphen;west Queensland where the old Aboriginal reserve known as the Yumba was handed over to the people of Mitchell for reconstitution as a centre for cultural exchange and for teaching young Aboriginal people and other young people about the culture of that area. It has become a very important place for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people in that area. It is important that we do not surround handovers like that particular handover with more red tape if we are simply to convert them under the Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fast tracking provisions improve on the processes in the current act in a number of ways. In the first instance, native title representative bodies play an expanded and important role in assisting the tribunal to identify and facilitate the selection of claims which should be fast tracked. Secondly, fast tracked applications will only be available to claimants who have regular physical connection with the area under claim. Where land such as vacant crown land, national parks or a conservation reserve is currently owned or under the control of indigenous people, it should be relatively easier for native title holders to be granted their native title rights. I say `relatively' because some governments, most notably the Queensland and Western Australian state governments, have been found not to have acted in good faith when dealing with native title applicants. I am happy to spend a couple of hours putting on the record some examples in relation to the Queensland government, but I am sure you do not want me to do that.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The John Koowarta case is a prime example. That was not a native title claim but simply the handover of a pastoral lease to an Aboriginal group. It was opposed by the state government. It finally ended up in the High Court where the Queensland government challenged the Racial Discrimination Act. The Queensland government was defeated. In order to thwart both the High Court and native title people obtaining some justice, the Queensland government then 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> converted the pastoral lease to a national park. They are the lengths to which the Queensland government will go to prevent Aboriginal people getting title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, these fast tracking provisions ensure that indigenous people who are not native title holders retain occupancy rights over the land claimed. It should be noted that any objections to the fast tracked processes which are registered within the three-month notification period will mean that these provisions will not apply. Last night the government indicated that they supported the fast tracking provisions. Senator Minchin said that the only problem he had with the amendments was with their form in relation to the Brandy decision and the manifest inability of the tribunal to make determinations of native title. On this basis, that consideration of the provision was deferred. I note that the possible difficulties from the Brandy decision have now been effectively dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will the government now be supporting the amendment? I think we have had an indication from the minister. However, I would urge the government to support these provisions as a way of facilitating a just outcome as they pertain to claims that are not controversial. Finally, these fast tracking provisions ensure that indigenous people who are not native title holders retain occupancy rights over the land claimed. I think the Senate would be aware of a number of problems in that area. It should be noted that any objections to the fast track process which are registered within the three-month notification period will mean, as I said before, that these provisions will not apply.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we are talking about here is nothing out of the ordinary; nothing that should cause too many people concern. We are actually talking about a capacity to fast track recognition of native title on Aboriginal lands or other categories of lands where the character of the tenure granted was clearly intended to benefit Aboriginal people. We are actually trying to facilitate and help Aboriginal people to be able to have recognition of native title, in essence, on their own land. Senator Margetts is moving an extension to include associated lands as well. It is not as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10309"> if we are really going to be affecting too many other people here. I do ask the Senate to look upon this with that beneficial backdrop.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When were here yesterday the government expressed concern that our amendments did not satisfy the Brandy test. We have gone back to what I suppose we can call the full bench of Bastan QC and Castan QC and we have asked them to have another look at it. I will tell you what, Senator Minchin, you might laugh at them, but they have a pretty good strike rate in the court system. In fact, if it was not for them, we would probably not even be here discussing Mabo or Wik. And, of course, there are other people with them. What we have come back with is a proposal which picks up some of the concerns that you had yesterday, particularly as to language. It is a proposal which is probably worth going through for a few moments now. It is embodied in our R359, section 191.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, the system will work in such a way that the rep body will be able to give certifications to the registrar. What the rep body will be doing is what a tax agent does, or what a facilitator does, in terms of settling a claim. The rep body will be able to get the people together and through its inquiries be able to settle the claim. That is, in essence, what we are talking about. Instead of using the word `determination', the advice to us is that we use the word `certification'. That is, in essence, what we are asking the rep bodies to do: to certify, as a tax agent would, all aspects of the claim. If you are a lawyer, you would be settling the claim. A lawyer settles a claim and puts it into court. In this case the rep bodies settle the claim. We say they `certify' it. In many legal processes you also say that lawyers certify affidavits and so on. The rep body has got that particular role and no more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">     The next step is that it goes to the registrar. The registrar has an administrative function. If there is no appeal with in three months, the registrar enters the certification on the register. That is what the registrar does normally anyway, so there is nothing new in terms of the functions of the registrar in that step. By the very title of the person, that is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their role; they put items on the register. So what we are asking to happen there is also nothing extraordinary. In fact there is already precedent in existing native title legislation for that role of the registrar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of being concerned with Brandy again, what we are saying the registrar will do is to enter certifications. Like a clerk of court, the registrar will put those on the court file or on the register. If, however, there is a dispute as to the register and how that register should stand, then under 191A(4) we provide that any such dispute and any exercise of judicial power goes directly to the Federal Court. In (4) we provide a list of the people who have standing, as against the certifications, by way of an appeal, and they are indigenous people and people who have regular physical connection, although maybe not native title claimants. We also, of course, list the Commonwealth, a state or a territory, or a person having an interest in the land comprising the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, once you have got the admin work done, the register is there, as in the Family Court, as in the local courts, as in supreme courts, as in the High Court. If someone wants to appeal against that, then they can take, under 191A(5), an application to the Federal Court. That application to the Federal Court goes as to whether the certifications should be entered and whether they should be varied. They can dispute whether that particular person or persons had the required connection and so on. There is no Brandy problem at all, and no matter how much you want to bite your fingernails and try to find it, it is just not there.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">`<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As I said earlier in the day, the model that we accepted before lunchtime, in terms of fast tracking for small claims, is the model that we are applying here. We have made some amendments to it, as suggested in the debate yesterday, to clarify the language. Our amendments do provide consistency in terms of recognising the process as a certification process and recognising that any judicial exercise is going to be conducted in the Federal Court. As I say, we are not asking for much to happen here. What we are saying is: let there be a way that indigenous Australians 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10310"> can actually, in a fast track process, claim title to their own land, and at the same time protect anyone who may have a valid interest.

We did it this morning and I did ask the minister a question about the merits of the provisions for small claims this morning.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the ultimate, I adjudged that there was not a very strong opposing view by the government to my question.

We do have considerable concern about the conflict of interest involved with representative bodies and the quite significant elevation of the role of representative bodies. They are being given quasi judicial functions through this process. If you read the fast tracking functions of a rep body that are set down in 203BHA(2), you would see that they really are quasi judicial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Representative bodies are there as advocates for native title clients. We have real concerns about the merits of this proposal with regard to rep bodies, but we also have concerns about its constitutionality. Effectively, you are conferring on the rep body the right to confer common law rights of exclusive possession on a particular group of people. We are talking about common law rights with native title. They are legal rights, with considerable consequences. It is wrong in principle and wrong constitutionally to confer such a power on a representative body, which is the net effect of these provisions, so we have concerns about them both on merit and in principle.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know how long we are going for, but I want to put a few things on the record about this. We are going to give rep bodies the role of a post office or a tax agent&mdash;nothing more than that. Their role is to certify the facts as they have been able to work them through with their members and claimants. Once they certify that, in the same way that a tax agent may certify facts and claims on behalf of a client, in the same way that a lawyer may produce and settle documents on behalf of a client, that is what the rep bodies do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No legal force comes into play until the matter finally goes on the register. Before it goes on the register, there is capacity for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10313"> appeal to the Federal Court. You may not like rep bodies, but the role of rep bodies has absolutely nothing to do with, for instance, Brandy for a start. The Brandy problem that you are talking about might have something to do with the registrar, but the rep body is not a judicial or administrative authority, it is a representative body. All it is going to do&mdash;and you know very well that that is all it is going to do&mdash;is what a tax agent normally does in respect of a tax claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To then say that the rep body confers rights is a distortion of what this proposal is about. Senator Minchin, if you want to finish this before Christmas, try to focus on what is before us. The process is that the rep body settles a claim. That is all it does. We use the word `certifies', but if you want to use the word `settles', we will use the word `settles'. The process is no different no matter what you call it. The process is acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a question of giving the rep body the status of God in this process. The rep body will have the function of basically crossing the t's and dotting the i's, working out who is who, and saying, `This is how we see it.' They put that up to the registrar, in the same way as a tax agent does it. We are not saying that a tax agent has the call of omnipotence either when it plays that role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It then goes to the registrar and then, in that process, before anyone's rights are affected, all parties with an interest have a capacity to take the matter to the Federal Court. Nothing could be fairer than that, and any distortion you might be using here to try to influence this debate&mdash;quite unfairly and quite improperly&mdash;should be bounced out of court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Read 191A(4). Read 191A(5). Clause 191A(4) says that people have `standing to appeal against the certifications' and 191A(5) says that people may `make applications to the Federal Court'. The rep body certifies, it goes on the register for the whole world to see&mdash;particularly that part of the world that might have an interest in this area. Once the part of the world that has an interest sees this off the register, then it has a right of action. Nothing could be fairer than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You say that we have given the rep bodies extra roles, but it is the government that says 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the rep bodies have a very valid role to play and should be playing it. As you keep saying, you give them $40 million to conduct these roles. Part of the role could be to act as a post office, a facilitator, a lawyer, a settler of documents, a tax agent. For you to distort that and blow it up into a position where you claim that the rep bodies basically have the capacity of a High Court judge or a parliament is a totally unfair distortion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are really interested in streamlining the process of recognition of native title in this country, you have no real option but to agree with a proposal like this. Native title rights are out there now&mdash;they currently exist. This proposal prevents the useless waste of public resources in drawn&hyphen;out situations where they are not necessary. If they are necessary, then there is a capacity to move them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, what we do here&mdash;and I would have thought this would also be attractive to the government&mdash;is that you have a tribunal with 667 claims to determine, potentially taking a lot of claims out of its workload is going to be of use to them, of benefit to the public purse, and of benefit to people who might be in the queue waiting for claims to be determined.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a certification that you hold native title. You are the one who is trying to distort what is being proposed here. The rep bodies have been given the power to determine who the native title holders are. Once they have issued the certificate, then the registrar must enter that,

You could cloud this by changing the word `determination' to `certification' and saying that it is like a tax agent. Tax agents do not award common law rights to exclusive possession to anybody&mdash;not my tax agent anyway&mdash;and that is what you are involving the rep bodies in in this process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While you have couched it and changed the wording and all that sort of stuff, this proposition still boils down to the rep bodies being given the authority to identify native title holders and effectively confer on them exclusive possession at common law. Native title is a common law right; it is not a statutory right. The world would have gone mad if we had tried to convert it to a statutory right. That is what Western Australia tried to do. This is a quasi attempt to convert it to some sort of statutory right. It remains a common law right which, as a consequence of Brandy, everybody agrees can be determined only by a court. The right of appeal to the Federal Court means nothing in the context of Brandy, because that was exactly the situation in Brandy and with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. So we have real problems with this from the point of view of merit in terms of what is being conferred upon rep bodies and from the point of view of the constitution.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again, Senator Minchin either does not understand or does not want to understand the process here. It is similar to the process we adopted this morning. As Senator Harradine says, there are two bundles of problems: Brandy related or policy desirability. In terms of Brandy related problems, as I said, this follows the process we adopted this morning. Basically, the process allows for something to be put on the public register, people get notice of it and people can contest it before any conferring of exclusive or whatever possession you might want to tell people has been conferred takes place. It is a process. So I do not think the Brandy argument holds much water.</PARA></TALK.START>

Yes, other persons can appeal against the certification, and those are listed in 191A(4)(a),(b),(c) and (d). Notwithstanding that, those people are given a head start.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine, two sorts of situations arise here. One is where there is no dispute. Obviously, there is no head start if there turns out to be no dispute&mdash;and in many circumstances there will be no dispute. In the case of where there may be a dispute, the actual fact that someone is under certification does not give anyone a head start, because there is no presumption to be drawn from that certification. It is not as if, because you are under certification, someone has to disprove that you should be there or prove that they have to be there over and above the proof that you show. So basically the certification does not in any way verify or validate or confirm any particular right; it only happens through the court process. In that court process the normal rules of evidence would apply. So the court would not, for instance, treat the certification as something that is certain until proven otherwise; the court would look at the whole bundle of competing interests and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10315"> apply the normal rules of court and the normal burdens of evidentiary proof that are required here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the answer is clearly found in the processes of the court and the fact that a certification is basically a notification. It is as if you are saying, `If someone appears on a court register as making certain claims, does that give that person a head start?' The answer is no, because the normal rules of evidence would apply. In these circumstances the normal rules of evidence would apply in the Federal Court and the certification would not apply in cases of dispute. The real benefit of such certification is in those areas where there are no disputes. As I say, given the fact that we are talking about areas that are Aboriginal reserves or areas that are substantially granted for the benefit of Aboriginals, that is where the advantage here is. The advantage is clear: no dispute&mdash;Aboriginal land; where there is dispute, no&hyphen;one gets a head start, because the normal court rules apply.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is not the role of the rep bodies to grant title rights to anyone. That is the process that we are providing for through the whole body of the amendment, from proposed subsections 1 to 6. They have put it on the register. They certify who those people are. If there is no appeal, if people are happy with it, then obviously it goes on to have effect, but it cannot have effect in the case of dispute. They do not confirm to the exclusion of all others, because if any others did have an interest, then they have a right to pursue this matter in the general court sense, in which circumstance anyone on or off the certificate&mdash;each group individually or each

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> through a court process to prove them if there is a dispute, but those rights, as Senator Margetts said, were recognised by the High Court and were confirmed through the Native Title Act.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know it is a long debate, Senator Bolkus, but calm down. Your proposed section 191A(3) says that if there is no appeal, the registrar must enter the certification, stating that the native title rights and interests confer possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the area concerned on the relevant people to the exclusion of all others. That is a conferral by the rep body on the people it identifies&mdash;and it alone&mdash;and the grant to them of exclusive possession of the area of land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not quibble about what is being done here. That is an extraordinary power to bestow upon a rep body. What the High Court said as to native title is that our common law recognises the traditional law and custom and recognises that native title right where the court is satisfied that the native title claimants have maintained their traditional connection to the area and there has been no extinguishing act by government. That is what native title is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are recognising the quite legitimate interest in Aboriginal people who already 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10317"> occupy land having the addition of native title. That occurs through our sections 47A and 47B, where we ensure that no regard should be paid to any previous extinguishment act. It takes that whole issue out of the equation. This proposition is made worse by the Greens (WA) proposition that national parks in the area concerned be included. As I say, we would be conferring exclusive possession over national parks if the Greens (WA) amendment were incorporated. I would have thought that would pose extraordinary legal consequences and difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley has made accusations against the Queensland government. The Queensland government, of all Australian governments, has concluded an agreement in Hopevale. After the Federal Court makes the appropriate determination, it will result in, for the first time on the Australian mainland, a group of people exercising determined native title rights. As this government and I have said, we applaud the Queensland government for negotiating that agreement in quite difficult circumstances, even though it is a DOGIT land. So there are processes in place and it can be achieved. Our amendments will facilitate it. We believe that this proposition simply goes too far. It has constitutional problems.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For about three days in a row now, I have heard a history lesson on how the Queensland government has treated Aboriginals. I thought I should come in and retell a story about an event that happened slightly after the war. It will not take long, but I think it has to be told. Let me relate the story. It happened after the war. During the war or slightly after the war started, the people at Hopevale were rounded up and put in an Aboriginal community at Woorabinda. There was a Lutheran mission there, and the Lutherans were German pastors. While the war lasted, an epidemic swept through Woorabinda. Something like two-thirds of the Hopevale people died through this epidemic. After the war, the people at Woorabinda who came from Hopevale decided to ask someone to take them back to Hopevale. This person was told that if the Aboriginal people wanted to go back to Hopevale and he could accommodate it, that it was all right. But he could not just take them and put them back in the bush with no hospital, schools or houses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular person, with his own money, flew in his own plane with an Aboriginal person called Rosendale to establish where a community could be set up. He then got on a horse and rode out for three days to establish where the community could be. He laid out plans for a community centre. After all this was done he went to Woorabinda and took the people back to Hopevale where the community had been set up. That particular 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> person was the then Premier of Queensland, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I hear Senator Woodley continue to criticise what the government did I am reminded of former Senator McMullan. Mr McMullan came with Senator Collins and me on an ATSIC committee and we flew to the communities. The then Senator McMullan said to me, `I have never seen anything like the conditions that the Queensland Aboriginal people have. They are very, very high standard.' He said, `They are the highest standard I have ever seen in communities.' I am also reminded of the time that we were going around with then Senator Bjelke-Petersen and we met an Aboriginal person who worked for the Bjelke&hyphen;Petersens during the war. He said to her, `Flo, I was always welcomed at your table. I ate with you, and I was always welcomed in the house.' He never forgot it.</PARA>

For indigenous Australians it would be very divisive if in some states they had access to certain review or arbitral processes and had rights of procedure and they were different in other states. There could be nothing more divisive for the community than if you had a situation where the states and territories, in setting up their own processes, could totally deviate from the national benchmarks. The legislation does allow for a degree of deviation from the national benchmarks. That would be of concern to indigenous Australians but also of concern to stakeholders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you were a mining company, for instance, operating in more than one state, the last thing you would want would be claims in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this area to be handled differently state by state. We already have those sorts of problems, for instances, in the consumer law area where nationally operating companies have to have in place six or seven different regimes to handle consumer protection, to handle building regulations, to handle all sorts of other planning and environmental regulations. That sort of inconsistency is not in the national economic interest. It is very divisive. If you have groups of people with different rights in different states then it will not be all that long before the tension between claimants in each state and the tensions on industry in each state will start to play a very divisive role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could also look at pastoralists, for instance. There would be problems if their rights were different from one state to another. Procedural rights are extremely important in this regime. To the extent that there is any inconsistency, the national economic good is not advanced and the system can be very easily discredited. Given a situation where you might have a potentially good state authority that may not get up to speed, the capacity for a national tribunal to play a part in that process continually is also important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why we think there needs to be a capacity for access to a national tribunal. I know that Senator Harradine's amendment yesterday, which I think was accepted, to have a national member on a state based tribunal gives some degree of cross&hyphen;fertilisation. It does not give you the national benchmarks that you might need. We say it is important to have a capacity for claims to go from the Federal Court to the national tribunal. We also say that the Federal Court should be to send those off to the national tribunal where the court deems it appropriate. I suppose that is the genesis of the need to raise these amendments and that is what these amendments try to do.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect, I understand what the opposition is trying to achieve, but I suspect that is not achieved by this amendment. Section 207A will incorporate or repeat 251, which is about recognised state or territory bodies in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10321"> current act. They are the bodies that can exercise the judicial function of making determinations of native title. They do not have exclusive jurisdiction and our amendments do not seek to give them exclusive jurisdiction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That whole provision in the current act continues. For example, my state of South Australia does have a recognised state or territory body which operates under these provisions, but it is not exclusive. Native title claims can be brought in either the state jurisdiction or the federal jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are establishing as a consequence of Brandy that, for the purposes of mediation and arbitration in respect of the right to negotiate, a separate equivalent state body mechanism&mdash;that is, an equivalent state body to the tribunal&mdash;in the performance of the functions performed by the tribunal which are not judicial but which are administrative; that is, the mediation service and the arbitration in relation to the right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you have got two things operating here. You have got the court system through 207A and the capacity to recognise state bodies there, but there is no exclusivity to that. Then at the next level you have got the tribunal. We propose in 207B that there be the capacity to establish equivalent state bodies to the tribunal but only if the criteria are satisfied. Those criteria are set out repeating the words used in subsection 251(2)&mdash;`In order to ensure that there is a nationally consistent approach to the recognition and protection of native title . . . '</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are saying that 207B would ensure that a state body operates under the auspices of the Federal Court performing the functions otherwise performed by the NNTT, but to the standards of the Native Title Act as amended. So it is standing in the place of but performing the functions of and to the standards of the Native Title Tribunal. That seems from our point of view to make eminent sense, if states are prepared to set up these bodies, pay for them and have them established under state law but performing functions ordained under the Commonwealth act and to standards set by the Commonwealth act, and at all times with the actions or the claims under the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> auspices of the Federal Court, at all times the parties having recourse to the Federal Court and their claims being, ultimately, determined by the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly from the government's point of view, we think it is an important policy proposition. I think the ALP is attempting to provide the opportunity for a party to opt to go to the national tribunal rather than the state tribunal if one is set up under 207B. The problem with that is that it will not provide much incentive for any state to set up an equivalent state body under 207B if claimants can opt to have their matter dealt with in the national tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that sort of provision would effectively kill 207B. We do think it is an important provision. We do think that, because land management remains the responsibility of the states and because these and the mediation functions do involve a whole lot of interested parties essentially operating under state law at the state level and in the bounds of a state, it does make sense to have this mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once a body is set up in a state and recognised, then the Federal Court refers the matter to that state body for mediation and the application of the right to negotiate provisions but according to the standards set in the Commonwealth act. I understand the amendment proposed, but I think it needs to be reworked.</PARA></SPEECH>

In those circumstances it is quite desirable that the Federal Court send those matters off to the national tribunal rather than back to the state.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am obviously supportive of the view that has been expressed around the chamber that it is desirable for the state bodies to be ad idem with the federal body. It is desirable to have a consistent application of the provisions of this legislation irrespective of whether that application is performed by the national body or by state and territory bodies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned last night, I noted that the new native title mediation regime will require that all native title applications be filed in the Federal Court, and the court will then refer registered applications for mediation either to the National Native Title Tribunal or to the equivalent state or territory bodies. Under those circumstances, it is in the interest of national consistency that the mediation processes pursued by the state and territory bodies should be uniform. The government stated in its explanatory memorandum that the purpose of the criteria that it has proposed for the state and territory bodies:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is to ensure that the powers and functions conferred by the determination on the equivalent body are exercised or performed in a `nationally' consistent manner.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yesterday we did adopt&mdash;and Senator Bolkus referred to it&mdash;an amendment of mine to provide that equivalent bodies each have as a member one of the members of the national mediation authority; namely, the NNTT. Having considered the matter again, I am wondering whether that goes far enough&mdash;and maybe this was an oversight of mine&mdash;because there is nothing in the legislation to protect that person, who would be the common link between the NNTT and the state 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bodies, from being marginalised by the state bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am wondering whether the minister could bear that in mind and see whether or not, in the ultimate, something can be done to ensure that that marginalisation does not take place. I do not say that it would necessarily take place. I make no reflections upon the state or territory bodies at all. But I do raise that point. Having regard to all of those matters, I wonder whether the minister could take that on board. Could the minister also indicate to the committee the considered view of the government in respect of Senator Bolkus's amendments as now amended.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we will certainly take on board the point that Senator Harradine makes about tribunal members and ensuring that those who sit on the equivalent body are not marginalised. You make a fair point and I think we could accommodate that in due course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We understand where the opposition is coming from on this but, given the strict criteria we are establishing here for the establishment of equivalent bodies, we do not believe any purpose is served by what is described as `the capacity for forum shopping'. Once you set up an equivalent state body `performing specified functions or exercising specified powers of the Native Title Tribunal', that should be an exclusive jurisdiction. Unless the state governments know that matters will be referred to their state bodies, we are just worried that 207B would be rendered absolutely useless, because there would be difficulty in making a decision to establish such a body, in seeking a federal determination that would be determined as an equivalent state or territory body under these provisions, if it remained the case that all claims could continue to be dealt with through the national tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, from a policy point of view, we think it is a good idea to have these equivalent state bodies performing the powers and functions of the Native Title Tribunal according to the criteria laid down in the act&mdash;acting in the place of but according to the standards of the

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The process of reform in the Australian wheat industry has been both protracted and difficult. Governments, both Labor and coalition, the industry and the Wheat Board itself have worked to ensure that the structure of wheat marketing is able to meet the challenges of the future. In March, an in&hyphen;principle agreement on a new structure was reached: the single desk was to stay, grower ownership and control was to stay and self&hyphen;determination by the industry was to remain a central policy plank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite this agreement, there were still some grass root concerns within the industry that these changes would not be for the better. Many of these concerns were articulated by the New South Wales Farmers Association, but they remained committed to the process. Association vice&hyphen;president, Xavier Martin, summed it up when he told the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee inquiry into the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill that growers in New South Wales feared that `what we are building is just another middleman'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were also concerned that they were being asked to support part 1 of a two&hyphen;part legislative package without seeing the second part. He went on to say, `Growers feel that there is very little incentive for them to pursue the process.' But the industry leadership in the form of the Grains Council of Australia and the state grower bodies persisted. They were rightly of the view that the structure was sound. It was now a matter of getting the detail right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key issue for the industry was how the tax laws would be applied to wheat industry funds once the new private Australian Wheat Board was in place. The industry quite rightly felt that it was doing its bit; it was progressing difficult issues on behalf of a sceptical constituency and expected the government to recognise that fact. Xavier Martin told the committee that the growers' expectation `is that they will get tax treatment that provides the incentive for them to take risks in this structure'. That recognition was expected in the form of some taxation concessions at best, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10324"> but certainly not less than a fair hearing. The industry lodged its submission on the question of tax with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) in April. Mr Anderson repeatedly told the wheat industry that its concerns about tax and wheat industry funds would be given proper consideration. But he failed to progress the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a threshold issue for many. Some in the industry saw it as compensation, if you like, for the end to the government guarantee. It was to help allay concerns about what the ACCC might find in 1999 when it inquired into the public interest, or lack of it, in the maintenance of the single desk for export wheat. That point was made time and again in the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition also pursued the government on the question of taxation and wheat industry funds. We moved a second reading amendment to the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill, seeking to have it deferred until the whole restructuring package was available and the tax matter finalised. That amendment was voted down. But we continued to pursue the taxation issue with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Troeth) in the Senate. On Monday, 24 November, the parliamentary secretary told the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter of taxation is under consideration by the minister at present.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Under further pressure, Senator Troeth advised:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter of taxation is something that will be dealt with in the second stage of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Troeth then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that, after the minister has consulted with Treasury, there will be a working party meeting in Melbourne on this coming Thursday to consider the taxation issues and there will be a discussion of these taxation issues in the context of the next tranche of legislation . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is, the government told the Senate on Monday, 24 November that there would be further discussion with the industry about tax and the wheat industry fund on the following Thursday. However, the minister advised the industry by press release on Wednesday, 26 November that the government had made a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> decision on taxation and that that decision was final&mdash;no correspondence would be entered into. So we have a situation where the minister has clearly thumbed his nose at the consultation process, and Senator Troeth's statement misled both the Senate and the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question that needs to be asked is a simple one. Did the information supplied by Senator Troeth come from the minister? I think it is incumbent on Senator Troeth to clear this matter up. Clearly, if she was acting on information from the minister, and one can only assume she was, then the minister caused her to mislead the Senate. I regret that she has not considered the promises made by this government to growers to be of sufficient importance to have clarified the matter. We believe the commitment by the government for the Thursday discussion with the industry had a use&hyphen;by date. It was given simply to ensure the Senate passed the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This episode is yet another example of a failure of leadership on the part of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The President of the Grains Council of Australia, Mr Brendan Stewart, told the Senate committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the disappointments of the process up to now is that we have been waiting for some months for a draft ruling from the government on the taxation arrangements . . . We have continually pressed the issue with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy . . . I am not sure of the workings or the internal mechanisms of government in that term. But he assures us that he is continuing to ask for that on a regular basis . . . It is absolutely crucial to the growers and the growers' support for the grower corporate model and the restructured organisation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The internal mechanisms of the government are simple. The minister either supports the industry proposal or he does not. If he does, he argues the case with his cabinet colleagues and, if he is good enough, he wins the day. Mr Anderson told the industry he was arguing their case&mdash;he supported their claim. He told the industry that he kept asking the Treasurer (Mr Costello) but failed to get an answer, even though the Treasurer had advice on the matter sitting on his desk in August. It is now clear that the Treasurer simply ignored him.I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10325"> understand Mr Anderson then took the matter to cabinet and was ignored again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wheat industry sought some one&hyphen;off tax concessions as part of a fundamental structuring of its export marketing arrangements. It did not even get a decent hearing from the Howard government. Mr Anderson could not even deliver that. When he finally received a response from the Treasurer, Mr Anderson simply put out a media release. Despite government assurances to the Senate that further consultations with the industry were scheduled, he told the industry it was doing very nicely&mdash;in other words, `Stop complaining.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wheat industry showed strong leadership in delivering to the government support for the Wheat Board privatisation strategy. Mr Anderson's failure to display similar leadership on the issue has now put the whole privatisation plan at risk. This minister is Deputy Leader of the National Party. He is No. 4 in the cabinet pecking order, only one step below the Treasurer. But he has little authority in the cabinet room and his constituency is paying dearly for his failures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I finish this matter by quoting the President of the Grains Council of Australia, Mr Stewart. In response to the minister's press release, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What have we got from this Government. A kick in the teeth and a clear message from John Howard that a $7 billion industry, vital to the economy of this nation, means absolutely nothing to him or his Government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is another issue I want to raise tonight. It relates to the government's decision to approve the importation of cooked Canadian pig meat. At the last estimates hearings I asked AQIS a number of questions about a new disease, post&hyphen;weaning multi&hyphen;systemic wasting syndrome, or PMWS, identified in Canadian pigs. I was advised that AQIS had only just become aware of the disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, AQIS became aware of the disease a week before the minister approved the importation of cooked pig meat from that country. I asked whether there had been any contact with the Canadian authorities regarding the nature and extent of PMWS. The answer was no. Given that AQIS knew little 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the disease, I asked if it would suspend approval for the Canadian product to enter Australia. The answer was no. The officer told the committee that AQIS would get information on the disease and see whether or not the protocol should be amended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked AQIS to give the estimates committee an assurance that the existing protocol for Canadian imports would provide adequate protection from PMWS for Australian pig producers. The answer was no, the reason being that AQIS did not have sufficient information to give such an assurance. I pursued the matter further and found that AQIS had formed the view that the existing protocol was satisfactory. It argued that PMWS was a disease found in piglets and not slaughter&hyphen;aged pigs or pig meat. It argued that, in any case, the Canadians are required to export meat only from healthy pigs so that there will not be a problem. If that requirement provided adequate protection, we would not need any controls on any imported food.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now have a copy of a letter from the Pig Research and Development Corporation. The letter details findings of a preliminary risk assessment of PMWS from Canadian pork products. The corporation found PMWS to be a very serious disease which is widespread in Canada. The letter states that `there is a possibility that the disease is carried in pork products'. The corporation found it significant that the Canadian Food Inspection Service is currently undertaking research into detection of the disease in pork products. The corporation rightly stated that `one must assume it is in the meat of slaughtered animals until proof to the contrary is found'. It said it did not know if the virus was denatured by the current protocol applying to Canadian products. It concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the light of the lack of knowledge about the behaviour of the virus thought to cause PMWS, PRDC has concluded that import of Canadian pork and pork products may indeed be putting the industry at risk of becoming infected with the disease.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The PRDC letter also addressed Australia's GATT obligations in such a situation and advised that, in such circumstances, Australia was entitled to suspend pig products imported from Canada pending a further risk assess 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10326"> ment of PMWS to the Australian pig industry. Given this assessment by an authoritative body, the minister has no choice but to immediately suspend the importation of pig meat products from Canada. He must then direct AQIS to establish an independent panel of experts to undertake a risk assessment of this disease. If he does not, he is putting the whole pig industry at risk.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Background</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Pork Council of Australia has requested information from the Pig Research and Development Corporation regarding the possibility of post&hyphen;weaning multi&hyphen;systemic wasting syndrome, a newly&hyphen;described condition of weaned piglets, becoming established in Australia due to imported Canadian pork and pork products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PMWS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Post&hyphen;weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome has been diagnosed in 117 Canadian piggeries (AgriFood Canada, 1997) and has been reported in France, Spain and the USA. Commonly 5&hyphen;10% of weaned pigs are affected, although this may be up to 50%. Virtually all those pigs die or are put down. The syndrome tends to last in the piggery for a long time (possibly around a year).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No similar syndrome has been reported in Australia. To assess the possibility of PMWS entering Australia through Canadian pork, it is necessary to examine the possible causes of the syndrome, and possible routes of entry to the Australian pig herd. At present, PMWS has been associated with a strain of porcine circovirus (PCV); a virus only recently described and previously thought to be non&hyphen;pathogenic.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the report to the Australian parliament of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation was tabled. Because of the self-imposed embargo&mdash;I am speaking about members of the government&mdash;I wish to take a few moments of the Senate's time tonight in the adjournment debate to refer to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset, as the presiding member&mdash;in legal terms&mdash;of the Joint Standing Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, I would like to thank the current Director&hyphen;General, Mr Dennis Richardson, for his cooperation with the parliamentary committee through the year, which has been very much appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report records a successful year's operations by the organisation, an organisation which now does play a very important role within the Australian community. There are changed community attitudes now to intelligence agencies. There is a more maturer climate within the Australian community today than existed 20 or 30 years ago when there was some degree of polarisation with respect to their existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Australian community generally recognises now that there is a need for timely and high grade intelligence in relation to a lot 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10330"> of matters both within and outside of Australia. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation covers the matter of internal espionage within Australia. Their great test will come in a few years time with the Olympics. That will be a test of how good their intelligence gathering is and the interception of terrorist groups and other disruptive activities in what will be one of the biggest international activities we have ever mounted in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note in the report that there has been a reduction of 30 per cent in the staff of ASIO since 1991. That has been, more or less, a progressive reduction over the years. That in itself does not provide grounds for alarm because there have been considerable efficiencies made in the operation of the organisation, but it does mean that we have to watch the capability of the organisation to see that they can fulfil the role that we want from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned before that society's attitudes have changed towards intelligence agencies. One of the important ways they have changed is with respect to accountability. That accountability has to be mediated through the parliament. The parliamentary ASIO committee only covers one agency&mdash;that is, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. I have to say that it is an ineffectual committee with respect to accountability. The act which set up the parliamentary committee was amended in 1987. Section 91(4) of the ASIO Act says:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The functions of the Committee do not include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reviewing a matter that relates to the obtaining or communicating by the Organisation of foreign intelligence;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reviewing an aspect of the activities of the Organisation that does not affect any person who is an Australian citizen or a permanent resident;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reviewing a matter, including a matter that relates to intelligence collection methods or sources of information, that is operationally sensitive; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> originating inquiries into individual complaints concerning the activities of the Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Very simply, that means we cannot deal with anything relating to foreign intelligence. We 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cannot deal with anything relating to complaints by the community or individual complaints about the activities of the organisation. When you add to that the requirement that we cannot look at any operational matters, there is really very little the committee can do and I do not believe it fulfils the requirement of public accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are procedures that can be put in place to provide adequate parliamentary oversight and, as a member of committees now for quite some while in this parliament, I would be the first to concede that oversight of an intelligence agency requires different approaches and different procedures, for very obvious reasons, to the oversight we apply to the Department of Defence, the Department of Social Security or anything like that. Having said that, there are procedures that can be followed which do give adequate parliamentary oversight of the intelligence agencies without compromising their operational security, the safety of any of their operatives or the safety of any of the intelligence they gathered, and I think it is time that we moved towards that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that the Inspector&hyphen;General of Intelligence and Security has a vital role within the oversight regime, but his role basically is to see that laws are not broken, and it really does not go much further than that. But if we had a parliamentary committee that had effective oversight, then I think we would have a safety valve in some way; we would avoid or tend to minimise the incidents that we had some years ago when some disaffected members of ASIS, one of the other organisations, went public, and I believe this is a matter that must be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter in relation to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation that I want to bring up is the matter of archival records. In general, archival records are covered by the 30&hyphen;year rule for government departments. After 30 years, under a freedom of information request, they can be released. Of course, everyone in the chamber today would know that the cabinet papers of 1967, the year of Harold Holt's disappearance, were released today, and that is why there is no&hyphen;one in the gallery tonight, because there is a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10331"> great deal of interesting information there that came out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation started as an act of the Labor government in 1949 and one could presume that its records deal with the 1940s, and some even back to the 1930s or earlier. The point I would make is that if you go back 30 years from 1997 you get back to 1967, and the release of information from ASIO is in no way comparable with the release of cabinet information from that time. There would be no greater defender of the right of the agencies to maintain their operational competence by maintaining what is a requisite degree of secrecy than me. Quite obviously, methods used may well still be in use today, and at this time it may not be in the public interest to release details of how information was collected. At the same time, there would be people living&mdash;quite a large number of people&mdash;who were informers or were mentioned in an adverse way in that era.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that, without compromising those matters, more information could be revealed about the early years. I am talking about a period relating to the 1940s and the 1950s. Again I recognise that this is no simple matter. It is very different for the Department of Social Security or somewhere like that where you just open the filing cabinet and pull documents out. Any access to ASIO records is very manpower intensive and therefore costly for the agency, and the agency does bear a big cost in meeting freedom of information requests at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the period I am talking about now goes back 50 years to the 1940s and the 1950s. There is a great deal of information that has been released internationally: the VENONA files are a great mine of information of activities relating to the Soviet Union at the time. We have had the opening up of a great deal of Soviet based information since the ending of the Cold War, and of course there has been a spate of information come out from Eastern Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are legitimate demands by historians because there is a great deal of interest about 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what was going on in Australia in that period immediately after the Second World War and through the 1950s. That is witnessed by the number of articles that are appearing now about people like Burton, Milner and Clayton. I believe that it is possible to make more information available for legitimate historical purposes because there are a large number of people who lived through that era who are  interested. That period of the 1940s and 1950s was an era of great importance for us, particularly with respect to our international relations. Commensurate with maintaining the integrity of operational effectiveness and the rights of individuals who may have been named at that period, there is a legitimate argument to be made for the release of more ASIO information on what is now becoming a matter of some considerable historical interest.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="10331"><TITLE>Veterans

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to talk about a couple of issues. The first and the main one is a matter of concern to some members of our veterans community. A few weeks back the Senate dealt with the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R278">Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill 1997</XREF> . Many of the changes introduced by that bill came about as a result of a review of service entitlement anomalies which was conducted by the Departments of Defence and Veterans' Affairs. I should begin by saying that the Democrats particularly welcomed the extension of operational and qualifying service that was contained in that bill. That extension was part of the government's pre&hyphen;election promises in the veterans portfolio and I congratulate the minister and the government for addressing those anomalies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst commending the government for implementing these election promises, tonight I would like to draw attention to some issues which do remain unresolved. The first of those issues is the fact that a veteran who receives a disability pension for an injury received during wartime has that payment included in social security income tests. What 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10332"> makes this unjust is that these payments are not really income at all but are made as partial compensation for an injury that was received while someone was serving their country during a war.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Veterans' Affairs recognises this and disability pensions are not included in the income test for veterans' service pensions, yet they are counted for social security payments. I think it is fairly clear that this is an anomaly that exists between the two departments and it is one that the Democrats believe really does need to be addressed. It does not affect a huge number of people, but for those who are caught in it, it is a very real problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To its credit, the government did acknowledge this anomaly in its pre-election document to veterans and it promised to review this situation. My purpose in raising this issue this evening is simply to provide a gentle reminder to the government and to urge them to complete that review as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a response to a question on notice that was submitted by my colleague Senator John Woodley late last year, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) said that this review of income testing war related disability pensions was expected to be completed sometime during 1997. As we are nearly at the end of the year now, I am hoping&mdash;as are a number of other veterans who have been in contact with the Democrats&mdash;that the review will be finalised shortly. I am also hopeful that the review will recommend that social security rules be amended so as to exempt these compensation payments from the social security income test. The Democrats believe this would be the most just outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue I want to raise in relation to veterans matters tonight is that the government also promised to review the position of war widows who remarried prior to 1984. To my knowledge, this review has not yet begun and, again, it is an area I would urge the government to look into as soon as possible. One of my constituents, just by way of example, is particularly keen to see this review completed as he feels his mother and other women in positions similar to her could 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benefit from such a review. They are waiting on it patiently, but patience has its limits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to this constituent, who has been in contact with the Democrats over a number of years, his father served with the Australian Interim Forces from 1942 to 1949. Sometime later, he underwent a number of chest X&hyphen;rays and was subsequently diagnosed as having emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis and myocardial infarction. At this stage, he was being paid a service pension and was receiving treatment in a repatriation hospital. Unfortunately, his application for a TPI pension was refused by the Repatriation Commission on the grounds that his illness was not war related&mdash;a finding strongly disputed by my constituent and his mother.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following this decision, an appeal was lodged with the War Pensions Entitlements Tribunal. Evidence was given to the tribunal that this person had served in the Australian chemical experimental unit in North Queensland and had then spent three years as part of the British Commonwealth occupational forces in Japan immediately following the war. During this period, he spent two years within the Hiroshima prefecture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After this period of service and the various illnesses, he died in 1970 and, understandably, his family are convinced that his service in the chemical experimentation unit and then in Hiroshima contributed to his early death. His wife was left with a young family to support and, with mounting financial pressures, she entered a marriage which regrettably was later annulled. She maintains to this day that, had she been eligible for a war widows pension, she would never have remarried. To receive a war widows pension now, this former serviceman's wife would have to overcome the twin hurdles of her former husband being found not to have died of war related injuries and her being excluded due to having remarried.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the review promised by the government might not directly assist this constituent, I think it is important to give some sort of detail by putting on the record an example of the real life situations that people are in and to give a human face to some of the problems faced by some war widows. I am sure the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10333"> Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Scott) would be aware of women in similar circumstances and would also be aware of the need for this review to be undertaken. It is for that reason that I would simply add my support and my encouragement to the government to get on with the review and finalise it as quickly as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a second matter&mdash;and I think completely unrelated&mdash;I move to the issue of fox hunting. I would like to make a brief mention of the decision of the British House of Commons, which passed by a very large vote of 411 to 151 the second reading stage of a bill to outlaw fox hunting&mdash;in fact, it went a bit broader than that. It related also to the hunting of deer, hare and mink as well as foxes; it basically related to a ban on the hunting of wild animals with dogs. Obviously, that is a debate that got reasonably impassioned and it aroused a lot of interest on both sides of the issue, but I think the size of the vote in favour of that ban is an encouraging development in the UK parliament. It is important to emphasise that the legislation still has not got through all the stages that is required, and it is a matter for the British government and the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who says he supports the ban but has not provided time on the parliamentary agenda for it to clear all hurdles necessary for its final passage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this development in the UK is part of a slow but reasonably clear trend of people around the world who are now taking a more humane approach to how we treat animals, and it is certainly one that the Democrats would encourage. We welcome any move away from practices which cause unnecessary suffering to animals. The Democrats have a long history of encouraging a more humane approach to animals we share the planet with and to animal welfare issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to encourage Australian governments to take note of this development in the UK and to work a little harder to move in a similar direction. The main hunting issue that has had the highest profile in recent years in Australia is duck hunting. Many state governments have moved towards banning that unnecessary, cruel and environmentally destructive practice, and I would encourage 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> other governments to follow suit in that area and in other areas so hunting that is purely recreational, that does not serve any useful environmental purpose and that is inhumane, is phased out as soon as possible.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="10333"><TITLE><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Media Watch</EMPHASIS></TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on the adjournment debate tonight to discuss <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Media Watch</EMPHASIS> , the weekly review of mass media which has  appeared on ABC television since 1989. I should state at the outset that I consider the program to be among the most important on Australian television. It is compulsive viewing for public affairs addicts such as me. It provides an invaluable public service. It is a telling example of why we need a national public broadcaster such as the ABC. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Media Watch</EMPHASIS>  would never be aired on a commercial broadcasting network.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not have time tonight to detail the myriad examples of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Media Watch</EMPHASIS>'s fine research work, but its exposition of the fraudulent Skase chase on Channel 7's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Today Tonight</EMPHASIS> was an obvious stand&hyphen;out this year. You can, therefore, understand my dismay that the credibility of its presenter, Stuart Littlemore, and, by association, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Media Watch</EMPHASIS> is currently under a cloud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It all began with a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program on the ABC early last month which discussed media accountability. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> producers had assembled three talking heads&mdash;Stuart Littlemore, American media analyst Steve Brill, and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> media journalist Pilita Clark. Littlemore and Brill got off to a fairly innocuous and, I would have to say, mutually admiring start, until Brill commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Stuart, you sound more arrogant than the most arrogant journalist I've ever heard.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You could hear the cheers from newsrooms around the country. Littlemore, who was visibly caught short, bit back very offensively and said, `You've got a good sense of the dollar, Steve.' He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Steve Brill obviously thinks there's a quid to be made, a dollar to be made, out of writing about the media. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10334"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Brill snapped back, `Do you do it for free, or&mdash;', and Littlemore cut across him with the response, `Yeh, I do actually.' At that point, I said to my television set, `Stuart, I hope that's true.' Indeed, Stuart, if you are out there listening, tell me it is true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made inquiries of the ABC. I did not ask for the quantum of any moneys paid to Stuart Littlemore. I simply asked, on the record, if he was paid by the ABC for his services on the program. The reply was yes. Mr Littlemore is paid by the ABC for his services as presenter of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Media Watch</EMPHASIS>. I stress that I am not interested in the details of the quantum or any arrangements Mr Littlemore may have in place for that money. They are matters between him and the ABC. Mr Littlemore may, for example, pay to charity all of the money that he receives for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Media Watch</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has dismayed me&mdash;and a number of fellow supporters of the program who have raised this matter with me&mdash;is the fact that Mr Littlemore has been prepared, for whatever reason, to allow this apparent inaccuracy to stand on the public record uncorrected for almost a month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I am aware, the last time Mr Littlemore appeared on ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> was on 20 August 1995 in a program entitled `Policing the Media', which I also watched. The program discussed a new code of ethics for journalists to replace the existing code in an attempt, in the words of host Kerry O'Brien, to `curb the worst excesses of the trade'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The signature film story was followed by a panel discussion, which included Mr Littlemore and his old foe Gerald Stone. At one stage, the discussion turned to the provision in the new code for journalists to `urge the fair correction of errors'. Mr Littlemore argued strongly that this provision was a pointless dilution of the existing tougher provision that journalists were duty bound to do their utmost to ensure the correction of harmful error.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is obvious. Mr Littlemore has thus far clearly chosen to ignore whatever code he wishes to follow. I do not wish to see <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Media Watch</EMPHASIS> and its presenter under a cloud. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Frankly, the program is too important for that. I am raising this matter tonight because this is, hopefully, the last sitting week of the parliament this year and, because of the Constitutional Convention, the parliament will go into recess until March next year, and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Media Watch</EMPHASIS> is already in recess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that before the first <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Media Watch</EMPHASIS> of 1998 goes  to air, the ABC must clarify this matter. I believe Mr Littlemore should take the first opportunity to set the record straight. Anything less will simply provide further ammunition for the legion of ag grieved journalists and editors who have suffered the sharp end of his tongue and his relentless campaign for honesty and accountability in our newspapers and on our airwaves.</PARA>
