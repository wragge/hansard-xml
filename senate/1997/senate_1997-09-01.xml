<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam President. When this debate was interrupted I was talking about other consequences&mdash;the displacement of development plans in relation to the IMF in favour of corporate plans. I gave the example of India in 1964&hyphen;65 where a famine was used by the United States and the World Bank to impose liberalisation of investment terms in the Indian fertiliser industry as a condition of providing food aid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The outcome&mdash;and the very thing that India had tried to avoid through its regulations&mdash;was that, rather than its using available Indian machinery and technology, all the equipment was imported by the United States firms that bought out the Indian ones. Rather than its using plentiful, Indian&hyphen;produced, naphtha as a feed stock, liquid ammonia was imported. Such situations create debt and an ongoing dependence on imports. The IMF SAP loans have institutionalised these kinds of arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new arrangements for borrowing were presented in the context of the Mexican currency collapse. It is worth pointing out that this collapse occurred despite stringent austerity measures, of the sort demanded by IMF, being in place for several years. It is clear that economic fundamentalist policy does not prevent such events. It is further worth noting that the main beneficiaries were the banks, whose loans would continue to be serviced&mdash;that is, the servicing of loans became a priority and human needs fell far down the list. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Mexican case, the IMF paid $1.3 billion, other governments paid $2 billion and the banks put up $5 billion in involuntary loans of the kind that we are involved in now&mdash;and which we will be&mdash;without having to refer to parliament. In that case, public money made up 40 per cent of the total package and the banks contributed 60 per cent. But 80 per cent of Mexico's debt is to the banks, so the result was a direct transfer of money from the international public to private banks. In a real sense this is the same as that joke I told in the previous debate: the so&hyphen;called `aid to developing nations in financial difficulty' is actually money going to banks that would otherwise be financially disadvantaged&mdash;so it is really no joke at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original loans which caused the debt problems were generally made to developing countries with the intention that they would use them to buy goods produced by the developing world. The irony is that the debt crisis was an outcome of the energy crisis in 1974 when the economy of the north was stalled and banks were awash with petrodollars deposited by the oil states. Lending to the south was a cheap way to kick&hyphen;start the northern economy&mdash;so the main benefits were to the north.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It might have been a neat Keynesian policy if the loans had not been made at very low but variable rates which rapidly climbed, adding billions to southern debt as the north got back to its feet on the back of southern demand and wanted the money for its own investment regime. The image of the north standing on the bent back of the south is fairly appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The IMF loans perpetuate the debt and poverty problem rather than alleviating it. The loans are good for northern banks, good for transnational investors, good for exporters to the south, but do little for the people of the recipient nations. The evidence of this, in relation to both Latin America and Africa, is extensive and damning. The evidence from India generally supports a very pessimistic view of the Bretton Woods trio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Closer to home, we have the evidence of the structural adjustment programs in Papua New Guinea. Structural adjustment programs 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6014"> have been imposed on Papua New Guinea since 1989. While the World Bank sometimes supports structural adjustment programs, making them conditions of its loans, it is generally following the lead of the International Monetary Fund. The latest structural adjustment program was signed in August 1995 and will see a direct contribution from Australia of over $65 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The structural adjustment program in Papua New Guinea was imposed without consultation with the community and is heavily opposed by that community, primarily through the efforts of the National Coalition for Socio&hyphen;Economic Justice. The coalition represents trade unions, churches, students, women's groups and other community groups. It recognises that efforts must be made to resolve the financial crisis in Papua New Guinea. It does not believe the structural adjustment program will be of any substantial benefit&mdash;it will certainly be of substantial harm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Items particularly opposed by the National Coalition for Socio&hyphen;Economic Justice include the repeal of the Minimum Wages Act. Here you have a bank telling a sovereign country what to do with its industrial relations and the welfare of its people. Other items include the abolition of price control for basic foodstuffs: some deregulated food prices have gone up by 200 per cent. Other items are increased fees for health care and repeal of the regulation under the Investment Promotion Authority, IPA, which advises on whether investments and investors are acceptable&mdash;based on financial, police and intelligence reports. The major issues here are corruption and gross abuses of the law, which are endemic in poorly developed nations. You have a situation where Australia becomes complicit in forcing sometimes very poor investment acceptance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another item is retrenchments of government employees, including teachers. We have raised the issue of Australian aid programs providing teachers at a time when Papua New Guinea teachers are being sacked as part of the economic austerity program. We are potentially running in two directions at the same time. Another item is the privatisation of state&hyphen;owned enterprises: while ideologically 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consistent with our government's position on its own enterprises, it is not necessarily in the interests of those in Papua New Guinea and is almost certainly against the will of the population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So where goes economic sovereignty? In terms of the real outcomes, I think it is morally and ethically bankrupt for Australia to be pushing that as part of its aid program. The above items are the sorts of things traditionally associated with structural adjustment program loans: coercive impositions on neo-colonial nations. They are the sorts of issues which have attracted widespread criticisms of structural adjustment programs in the International Monetary Fund and their support by the World Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national coalition met with the World Bank in October 1995 and the bank agreed that the only way the structural adjustment program will work is if community groups and NGOs are consulted. Though two years have passed, they have not been consulted. The criticism is not just from community groups; it is dominant at the highest level in various fora in the United Nations. Isn't it amazing? If there is any international fora that currently has some level of democracy, it is probably the United Nations, but when we come to decisions we are prepared to ignore them and money rules, okay, even if it is dumb money&mdash;dumb conditions and dumb money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the recommendations of the United Nations inquiries that we are asking government to use as a guideline on which activities and loans of the IMF are acceptable. This is not the same as imposing Australia's values on other countries; it is saying that the values that have been agreed upon by various slow and tortuous processes within the United Nations ought to be at least considered, and this not an unreasonable time to consider them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are asking for here is some recognition of the kinds of reports that everyone knows the name of and that everyone gives lip service to&mdash;the Brandt reports, the Brundtland report and the Turk report. We all talk as if everyone accepts the Brundtland report, the report which put the term `sustain 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6015"> able development' on the verbal map, yet few have actually read the report and fewer still support the recommendations. The report highlights the fact that poverty is inextricably linked to environmentally destructive behaviour. It also reinforces the finding of the Brandt reports that most development, so-called, results in greater, not less, poverty and inequity, both between nations and within them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Structural adjustment programs are not an answer. Mexico was heavily involved in imposing austerity regimes for several years prior to the collapse of their economy and it did nothing to prevent it. Many feel that it exacerbated it. The state following the purest form of structural adjustment was Romania under Ceaucescu&mdash;with massive exploitation of resources and people, destruction of social support and the community and ruthless pursuit of export dollars, all enforced by military and death squads. This is the direction that the International Monetary Fund pushes other nations. Under such circumstances it is positively immoral to support them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If you were to do an in&hyphen;depth study around the world of the level of internal conflict and disruption of ethnic wars of serious bloodshed&mdash;whether it be in Africa, South America or Europe&mdash;you would probably find a very strong connection between structural adjustment programs and economic fundamentalism and the impact on communities and the level of scapegoatism that sometimes comes out in highly violent outcomes. Yet what is Australia's position? They say, `Let's look at putting troops in. Let's look at arming in this region for future developments. Let's not look at what causes internal or even regional wars. Let's look at continuing doing things we are doing and close our eyes to what may be in the end very obvious connections between what we are doing economically and what happens in terms of countries and what happens between groups within communities when things are tough.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my opinion, it is unethical and immoral to support this bill. The Greens' position has been made very clear.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to speak to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R232">International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . I am following on from some of the comments made by my colleague Senator Bourne. The Democrats support the concept that growth should be sustainable, equitable and just. Therefore, we will be supporting the amendments put forward by Senator Margetts, which are directed at taking into account factors far broader than the financial straitjackets of financially powerful nations. I want to reiterate these concerns and also highlight in particular the position of young people as elements of this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many of the world's young people, the realisation of economic, social and cultural rights are very distant and, in fact, becoming increasingly distant. Approximately one billion people live in absolute poverty and around 180 million young people suffer from serious malnutrition. The trend is for these numbers to increase. They represent personal, family and community tragedies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Institutions such as the IMF have a world focus with an infrastructure which can be directed towards realising economic, social and cultural rights. The structural adjustment packages did include a social safety net in an attempt to offset the adverse effects of adjustment and give these packages a human face. These measures were welcome but they did not recognise the influence of international trade and financial concerns on domestic policy and the detrimental effect on basic human rights and, specifically, economic, cultural and social rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the IMF is driven by economic theory rather than the real experience of humans, politicians, communities and economies. As Senator Bourne said earlier in this debate, this money requires privatisation, tax reductions and the lifting of restrictions on the supply of offshore currency. I am concerned about these issues in Australia but I am particularly concerned about imposing these issues on other nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The economic meddling of today has a significant impact on the lives of young people, both now and, of course, in the future. The 180 million young people suffering from 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6016"> malnutrition are not to be ignored. Our social structures need to be changed to address this injustice and we need to include these people in our economic horizons. For this reason, I do support the inclusion of social justice criteria in loaning money. The criteria are directed towards an approach consistent with Australia's commitment to the International Bill of Human Rights, the Tokyo Declaration of the World Commission on Environment and Development and the Final Report on the Realisation of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Balancing our obligations under these international agreements and the positive outcomes from loaning money to nations has great potential for a fairer and more just world. I therefore commend the amendments before us to the chamber as a recognition of social justice for the future of young people around the world.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me start by thanking other speakers for their contributions to this debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R232">International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> and recording my appreciation for the substantial majority of non-government senators who are likely to support this important bill. This bill, as has been stated, enables Australia to adhere to the International Monetary Fund's new arrangements to borrow and it will simplify the framework for Australia's financial transactions with the IMF. The new arrangements to borrow, the so-called NAB, will double the IMF's capacity to borrow, forestall or cope with an impairment of the international monetary system or to deal with an exceptional situation that poses a threat to the stability of that system. The NAB will therefore enhance the IMF's ability to safeguard the international monetary system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Participants in the NAB will meet once a year to review and discuss macro-economic and financial market developments, especially those that could have an impact on the stability of the international financial system. This is potentially an important new forum for consideration of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill introduces a simplified framework for the conduct and recording of Australia's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> regular financial transactions with the IMF. Under the new framework, these transactions will be conducted in a more transparent and cost-efficient manner. The amendments proposed in the bill will have no impact on Commonwealth budget outlays or on the budget balance.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment is a reflection of the often dismal record of the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, in its loan policy. After World War II the Bretton Woods triplet&mdash;that is, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and GATT&mdash;were created to rebuild the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6018"> European economy and prevent the exploitation of the situation by private sector speculators. It is really interesting that it has done exactly the opposite. In over 50 years it has turned right around. How damaging the failure to rebuild and regulate was seen in the aftermath of World War I. As a second objective, the idealism of the allies against fascism translated into a desire for decolonisation, and the United Nations was born. The IMF, World Bank and GATT were to equally apply to the emerging colonies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the decolonisation of the nations subsequently defined as the `south' was followed by efforts to assist these nations who had been heavily exploited. We then had the infamous `development decade', which brought wealth to transnational corporations involved in `development' plans but did little for the people of the nations who were supposed to benefit. Meanwhile, the non-aligned group of developing countries, the Group of 77, were formed to fight what they called `economic colonialism', and this was followed by the debt crisis of the late 1970s. Various international organisations based in the United Nations began to look at the failure of classical development models. The United Nations Economic and Social Council and the United Nations Committee for Trade and Development were the most significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the debt crisis, caused by the lack of aid and aggressive marketing of cheap but variable&hyphen;interest loans in the `south', the United Nations established the Independent Commission on International Development Issues, under the chair of Willy Brandt. My amendment ties Australia's contributions to the International Monetary Fund to the recommendations of that report, published as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">North-south: a program for survival</EMPHASIS>, and the subsequent report three years later, published as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common crisis: north-south: cooperation for world recovery</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Brandt commission was established at the start of 1978 and made its first report in 1980 and its second in 1983. The first report includes a specific chapter on the world monetary order and two on development finance as well as general treatment of investment, international organisations and the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> action of transnational corporations. The commission has been widely recognised as the pivotal work on development in relation to the alleviation of poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the recommendations most pertinent to International Monetary Fund loans include: a call for legislation either coordinated laterally by the recipient nations and donor nations or internationally to regulate transnational corporation activities in matters such as ethical behaviour and the disclosure of information. Does this sound familiar? We are actually having our regulations systematically pulled out because they are considered to be anti-competitive. And disclosure of information, how often have we heard commercial-in-confidence talked about with regard to having anything to do with government and business these days?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report supports industry policy in the south to develop technological production. It supports preferential trading agreements between southern nations, which incidentally were the mechanisms Europe used in its own postwar economic reconstruction. It calls for an international trade agency that includes UNCTAD and a stabilisation of commodity prices at a remunerative level as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report does not seek to promote trade barriers but asks that trade be established on a fair rather than exploitative basis. That is not radical. It does not say that structural adjustment should not occur but says:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The Brandt report was not radical. It simply requires an awareness of or sympathy for the inclusion for the aspirations of the nations receiving IMF loans. Likewise, the Brundtland report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our common future</EMPHASIS> , was not a radical report. In fact, if anything, it has been condemned by some environmentalists for its connection of development with environment and its call for increased growth as being something that is desirable. In my opinion, the substance of the Brundtland report is rarely tackled. While people concentrate on its support of growth they ignore the fact that it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Revived growth must be of a new kind in which sustainability, equity, social justice and security are firmly embedded as major social goals.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> economic indicators, but also of the state of natural resources. Better income distribution, reduced vulnerability to natural disasters and technological risks, improved health, preservation of cultural heritage&mdash;all contribute to raising the equality of that growth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The other mistake that is frequently made is that the definition of sustainable development in terms of intergenerational equity is allowed to eclipse the fact that the majority report deals with international equity and distributional equity within nations as primary issues to address and attain sustainable development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Turk report is the most specific report looking at details of the IMF and its structural adjustment programs. We have included the text of the issues which it says ought to be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such calls and acceptance are not unconditional&mdash;that is, the Brundtland report's call for growth within the acceptance of the structural adjustments found in all such reports. It should only occur in conjunction with major calls for reform. The basic point is that it is entirely irresponsible and immoral to support an agency that makes loans on the basis of imposing austerity on poor and desperate nations. Its completely inappropriate and contrary to the valid aspirations of these developing nations and to the principles and purposes for which aid is offered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a sidelight, I would like to point out that this  International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill , announced last year, is the bill under which the Treasurer can appropriate money for the Thai rescue that was organised during the break. The Treasurer has already said that Australia will&mdash;not might or is considering&mdash;contribute some $1.36 billion. Currently&mdash;and he did not mention this&mdash;this will have to get some parliamentary approval. After the passage of this bill it will not. This bill authorises the Treasurer to contribute up to $1.5 billion&mdash;isn't that a convenient figure?&mdash;to any rescue package the IMF wants to organise and creates the approval in this bill. I have just mentioned the IMF, although it has stated aims, is quite happy to impose rescue packages which cause hardship and often internal disruptions within countries.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6020">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this respect, it is interesting to actually look at the Thai case. Nearly as soon as the rescue package was announced, commentators, including those in the major newspapers, pointed out that this was a rescue primarily of the transnational banks and the creditors whose goods were bought. They pointed out that it would have little effect on ordinary Thai people whether or not the rescue went ahead. They pointed out that the majority of the debt which resulted in the need for rescue was generated by consumption in the highest strata of Thai society. This highest strata generates people who are as rich as Alan Bond and Christopher Skase were. There is a huge vertical inequity in Thai society and the majority of people get a minimum wage of around $5 a day or less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the papers did not highlight is that transnational banks and financial investors often give loans for investment in areas where they have an interest, either as lenders to corporations producing goods and services or extracting natural resources as a financially related venture. They are therefore giving loans that serve their own interests. This situation was a prominent factor in the collapse of the Philippines economy and the banking sector itself has noted that a large part of that problem was the enthusiasm of the very young loan agents who went out promoting loans, particularly where the money would be spent on the products of associated or customer companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the kinds of things that created the debt problem in Thailand. It is therefore the transnational corporations, the transnational finance sector, Thai finance institutions and the upper classes of Thai society who will benefit from this rescue. Already in relation to the Thai rescue package I have heard that there will be restrictions on social spending by the Thai government. In other words, the Thai people will pay part of the cost of saving transnational and other wealthy interests by bailing out their bad investments. The other part of the rescue will be paid by taxpayers in Australia, Tokyo and other contributing nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of my amendment, if carried, would not stop the Thai rescue package or 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia's involvement in it. The impact would be to assure that ordinary Thai people do not have this rescue taken out of their metaphorical hides. It will also stop IMF conditions put on Thailand to, for example, increase exploitation of Thai forest resources. It is all very well going to firms and saying, `You should manage your resources better.' We are actually part of a structural adjustment project and will probably be pointing to Thailand and saying, `What have you got to sell? Let us rip some more mining out of Mindanao, despite what the environmental and social impact will be. Let us pull out more of your forest and leave it degraded so that people do not have the means of meeting their own basic needs.' That is what we are looking at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thailand is of course one of the few South&hyphen;East Asian nations that actually banned commercial logging in native forests, although that does not seem to have affected or stopped the logging. I understand the last forest of a unique native pine was to be logged in 1993 and the logging of degraded forests in Lanna, the north&hyphen;east province of Thailand, has continued over the strong protest of local villagers who have an excellent program of full ecological rehabilitation of local forests. These villagers have at times been relocated at gunpoint and their villages destroyed to facilitate the rehabilitation and replacement of forests with Tasmanian blue gums for the Japanese pulp market. My amendment would at least not allow the weakening of forest protection or pressure for `more liberal' foreign investment in pulp production to be a requirement of an IMF structural adjustment program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, as the minister has suggested, the Treasurer is going to be in a position of leadership in this regard, all I can say is shame on him. If this is the price of feeding the ego of a minister of the government to look good and important on the international agenda while ripping up the basic social and environmental basis of countries in this region, then shame on him and shame on the government. Shame, and it should be recognised. The irony is that this was one of those bills that the government wanted to shove through in lunchtime in

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me just take the first point in relation to the Thai currency swap. There has been very extensive debate in the parliament on that and I think there have been some questions asked in the other place in relation to that issue. The option is always available to people in this chamber, if they have concerns about that particular issue, to raise that matter. So, in that sense, the parliament is able to examine closely what the government has done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other avenues which are available. The Treasurer's annual reports to parliament on Australia and the IMF also provide an opportunity for scrutiny and for debate. Senators and MPs have access to all public documents produced by the IMF, including its annual report. That can always lead to questions. Information on Australia's relationship with the IMF can be obtained through the estimates process, the legislation committees of the parliament. Questions can be raised and are raised in those fora.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has had an interest in the IMF. Senator Harradine, as a member of that committee, would be aware of that. In 1993 the joint standing committee prepared a report on Australia, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. My advice is that the joint standing committee has met with the senior management of the IMF&mdash;I think the managing director in December 1996 and the first deputy managing director in February 1997. So there are plenty of areas where parliamentarians can raise issues in relation to Australia's relationship with the IMF. They can raise questions and seek answers through the joint standing committee, through the estimates process and through debates on annual reports.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill seeks to create the Productivity Commission through the amalgamation of the statutory bodies of the Industry Commission, commonly known as the IC, the Economic Planning Advisory Commission, commonly known as EPAC, and the non&hyphen;statutory Bureau of Industry Economics, commonly known as the BIE. For all practical purposes, the mergers have already taken place. Executive action already undertaken means that the merger of the bodies has already occurred in fact, if not strictly in law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has arrogantly disregarded the supremacy of parliament by acting as if the Productivity Commission was already operating, although the legislation that we are now dealing with is necessary to effect its creation. I think we should reflect on the fact that before the election the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, claimed he was going to respect the role of parliament and the supremacy of parliament. But the approach taken in respect of these three organisations is another example of where the proper parliamentary processes that the Prime Minister so vigorously argued in favour of prior to the election have been totally ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission even released on 19 July 1996 a report under the name of the Productivity Commission entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stocktake of progress in microeconomic reform</EMPHASIS>. Clearly, the handling of the report was a blunder, which has not been repeated, but it let the cat out of the bag about the real policy intentions of the government. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stocktake</EMPHASIS> report showed the policy agenda that the Productivity Commission and the government will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pursue, which includes further cuts in general tariff levels from 1 July 1997 from five per cent to three per cent; the abolition of the sugar tariff; and a review of all limits on foreign investment with a view to relaxing the current restrictions. It also includes minimising pricing oversight to situations of monopoly&mdash;for example, it would not be allowed for financial institutions or petroleum; the terminating of bounties; the terminating of export assistance such as the DIFF scheme and the export market development scheme; the removal of airport cross&hyphen;subsidies, thereby disadvantaging regional airports; and the introduction of road pricing in cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even more ominously, the report strongly suggests that minimum wages could be reduced and that wage loadings, including penalties, overtime and shift rates, could be slashed for many Australian workers. It also suggests stripping back award conditions even further than has been achieved by the government, and we can reflect on that debate and its outcomes in respect of the industrial legislation that was regrettably passed here last year because, I might remind this chamber, of an agreement between the Democrats and the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the issues mentioned in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stocktake</EMPHASIS> report are industry policy matters and the further concentration of advice will significantly increase the weight of the Treasury agenda views in the government. Whilst these views should, of course, be considered, they should be debated in the context of alternatives. Clearly, this is not going to happen with this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor pursued a competitive advice model to ensure that all sides of the debate would be considered. This is being dismantled by the Liberal&hyphen;National Party government and Labor is concerned that this will lead the government to pursue even worse economic and industry policies than the current policies being followed. When it comes to choice, competition and a competitive model for evaluating sources of advice, this government is not very receptive to that particular model.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the committee stage begins, I would like to point out some of the concerns that Labor has with this legislation. The first of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6027"> these is the dismantling of the system of competing sources of advice established by Labor while in government. This approach by the current government of creating the Productivity Commission was announced in one of those Cape Barren headland speeches of the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, which he delivered to the committee in Melbourne on 18 July 1995. It is interesting that the speech did not canvass the contribution to the public policy debate made by the Bureau of Industry Economics or by EPAC. There was no acknowledgment of the contribution these bodies have made and no plans to use the expertise or particular strengths built up over years. It was simply an agenda to narrow the focus of advice going to government, and to plonk it totally within the perusal of Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission was spoken of only in the context of expanding the functions of the Industry Commission, not in terms of taking on the roles fulfilled by BIE or EPAC. Ironically, though, Mr Howard quoted figures generated by EPAC in another section of that famous&mdash;some would say infamous&mdash;headland speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two bodies are being dissolved. They have had a very influential impact in the policy process and debate in this country. EPAC has produced some excellent and influential reports across a range of policy areas. The report by the private infrastructure task force is one example of the EPAC work which led to changes in government policy, in this case in the area of infrastructure bonds. The report into child care provides another example of where some of EPAC's recommendations were adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor did not support all these conclusions but we recognised the quality of the work and did not seek to silence the body that produced them. EPAC also performed the important task of conducting research into various long&hyphen;term economic issues. Examples included labour market matters, investment and economic growth, the effect of tariffs on economic growth and a range of demographic issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Bureau of Industry Economics examined a multitude of industry issues during its existence within the industry portfolio. One important function was the publication of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> international performance indicators in the context of benchmarking studies. Both general reports and those concentrating on specific industries were produced by the BIE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other important publications included various reports into regional trade policy, such as occasional paper 29 which examined the potential gains to Australia from APEC, and report 95/17 which examined the impact of closer economic relations with New Zealand. Other areas included infrastructure pricing, energy efficiency and the greenhouse issue and its effect on business in Australia. These few examples show that EPAC and BIE did have discrete complementary roles in the provision of advice and research and should not have been abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This behaviour shows the agenda of the Liberal&hyphen;National Party government, which is to get rid of alternative public policy advice. This is also reminiscent of the behaviour of the current government when it was in power during the early 1980s when alternative views were silenced, when those who disagreed with the New Right agenda were denied preselection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second major concern is the result of centralising economic and industry policy advice. The virtual monopolisation of economic policy advice under the treasury portfolio will be bad for Australian industry and bad for cabinet. There will now be no body reporting independently to the industry minister as the BIE used to. There will now be no body reporting independently to the Prime Minister as EPAC did. Treasury's record is not such as to inspire absolute and total confidence in its capacity to get things right, particularly if the only advice comes from its own stable. I know that the Treasury officials are glued to their TV sets watching the in-house coverage of this particular debate as they do with all the economic debates and question time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take that interjection. I bet he wishes, Senator Campbell, that, with respect to his performance in this chamber, he had had that sort of snappy policy advice that has been introduced by the Treasurer and Treasury.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I was saying, Treasury's record is not such as to inspire confidence in its capacity to get every thing right, particularly when the advice is from its own stable. We only have to look at the effect on the Australian economy of the last two budgets. We can debate a lot about the pace and desirability of reductions in government expenditure and the level of government debt, but one thing we do know&mdash;certainly, Mr Macfarlane from the Reserve Bank and even the head of Treasury, Mr Evans, have acknowledged it publicly&mdash;is that the sharp contractionary nature of the last two budgets has had a significantly depressing effect on consumer sentiment and confidence in the broader economy. That was significantly underestimated. If any of the government members and ministers were listening to broader community views during the parliamentary break they would have become only too aware of the very low level of confidence not just in the broader community amongst consumers but also amongst areas such as small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is not against Treasury nor the agencies in the Treasury portfolio. Rather, we argue for a plurality of views coming from a plurality of sources&mdash;quite literally, a competitive model on the provision of economic and industry policy advice to govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment. As I said earlier, the government is always talking about choice and competition but, when it comes to advice to Treasury and to the Treasurer (Mr Costello), it wants a monopoly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is not a monopoly of wisdom within the Treasury portfolio, although I acknowledge what I consider to be a very competent series of men and women who provide advice in Treasury. I recognise their qualities and the intelligent, considered contributions they make, but they are not always right. Therefore, the provision of advice should not be concentrated within that portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision of advice should be contestable, for the same reason that other spheres should be contestable: that is, because the quality of the product will generally improve in a competitive situation. This is advice that Treasury itself would provide on a daily basis, yet, ironically, it is not being followed by the government, which is supposed to be pro competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this legislation is doing is further marginalising the contribution of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) in the economic debate. After the election you could almost see Treasurer Costello rubbing his hands with glee at this proposal&mdash;which I am sure came from Treasury&mdash;to minimise and shaft the contribution of the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism, and the minister in particular, in the context of industry policy debate and economic debate in this country. You can just imagine the glee of Mr Costello when he saw this proposal coming across his desk: `Here's a way I can grab more power and bring more responsibilities under the control of Treasury.' The current Treasurer has pursued a consistently arrogant approach. It has been a hallmark of his style since the election of the current government last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our third concern is about the context in which the Productivity Commission may operate. There is no requirement in this legislation for the commission, when providing its advice, to have any regard to the real world in which Australian industry has to operate. Recent reports concerning tariffs indicate the overly theoretical nature of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6029"> commission's work. During estimates I had the opportunity to speak to Mr Kerr, the head of the Industry Commission, and my colleague Senator Watson, who is now coming into the Senate, asked Mr Kerr a number of very incisive questions, about textile tariffs in particular. I know Senator Watson shares Labor's concern&mdash;and Labor's demand&mdash;that the issue of the interim report on the textile, clothing and footwear industries should be responded to forthwith and that its recommendations should be largely rejected. In this context, Labor has called for a freeze in tariffs and continued support for the import credit scheme&mdash;which the Industry Commission has recommended be abandoned in the year 2000. We should take careful note of what our competitors are doing in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make a particular comment about my own home state of Tasmania. There are 2,000 jobs at risk in Tasmania. There are six major companies involved. One is Blundstone's, and I am sure I do not have to relate here the importance of Blundstone's and its very impressive record. It has 330 employees in Hobart. We have Sheridan Australia in Hobart, with 125 employees. We have Waverley Woollen Mill in Launceston with 93 employees. We have James Nelson with 81 employees in Launceston. In Devonport, Australian Weaving Mills has 280 employees and Tascot Templeton has 220 employees. Based on the Industry Commission recommendations, we certainly cannot be confident that the Productivity Commission bills we are dealing with will be dealt with in a balanced way, and we call on the government to respond to this interim report as quickly as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some other work carried out by the Industry Commission which we believed was seriously flawed. The motor vehicle industry report is another example that comes to mind.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree, Senator Watson. With a 13 per cent unemployment rate&mdash;and that is increasing steadily&mdash;on the north&hyphen;west coast and an unemployment rate of just on 11 per cent statewide, we cannot 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> afford to lose one additional job in Tasmania from current industries. This is an example of a rural and regional economy that is suffering&mdash;particularly at the present time&mdash;from the contractionary cuts of both a federal Liberal government and a state Liberal government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor strongly believes that the legislation should require the commission to have regard to the international trading practice of our trading partners and competitors: that is, what progress is being made by other nations to reduce tariffs and non&hyphen;tariff barriers. This advice should also be mindful of Australia's international obligations. This should be formally required of the commission, to help dispel the fear that many people have that the new body will be overly theoretical in its approach and, hence, too dismissive of the real conditions which Australian industry is facing. If the government opposes this proposal, effectively they are admitting that what they want is advice couched in the context of theory rather than of reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our fourth concern again relates to the context of the commission's advice, especially the regional impact of any advice. I have drawn the attention of the Senate to particular examples relating to my own home state of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our fifth concern, mentioned in our second reading amendment, relates to competitive neutrality. Labor supports competitive neutrality for business markets within the Australian economy&mdash;we did more to achieve this desirable outcome than any previous government&mdash;but Labor believes that competitive neutrality should apply equally across both the public and private sector. Government businesses should not enjoy unfair advantages which are not enjoyed by their competitors. There should be mechanisms to sort out whether  advantages exist and to remove these if they do not have public benefit. Labor also believes that public sector businesses are sometimes disadvantaged in competing against the private sector and that this has the consequence of denying consumers additional choice in some markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we support the appointment of a complaints body for the competitive neutrality 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6030"> reasons, Labor considers this function should be undertaken by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and not by the Productivity Commission.</PARA>

Northern Territorians responded to good economic judgments such as the announcement that the railway will go ahead. Finally, after nearly 100 years of promises by governments, the Howard government delivers.

In speaking about Jabiluka and Koongarra, he said, `Of course they have passed vigorous environmental impact statements.' But he said that, whilst they might be environmentally safe, they were politically deadly. Isn't that so typical of the Labor Party? In other words, they pass the environmental standards, it is good economic judgment but you do not do it because it requires

In other words, the third uranium mine was fine; there was something inherently evil about the fourth. What nonsense! They are simply not prepared to take difficult political decisions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is yet another hypocritical question. We are going to get a series of hypocritical crocodile tear questions from the other side. Now we have the Labor Party standing up for the private health insurance associations. I did not think that I would live to see the day because they have been trying to destroy them for 13 years. Now they are crying crocodile tears about the private health insurance associations and the troubles that they are getting into.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, I remind you that if you look over that 13-year history of what occurred in private health insurance, you will see it has been in free fall for a long time under the Labor Party. Senator Forshaw, I have no doubt that those figures that you are now producing are accurate. I would not doubt the figures because the figures were worse under the Labor Party. They have been worse at 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6033"> various times under the Labor Party. Senator Forshaw comes in here now crying crocodile tears and talking about the free fall occurring in the private health insurance associations.

We have only just brought in our changes&mdash;as of 1 July&mdash;to try to stop that free fall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like Senator Forshaw to tell me how many increases were knocked back by the Labor Party when they were in power for 13 years. I can answer the question for you. None&mdash;a big fat zero. You never knocked back any increases that were asked for by the private health insurance funds. Not one did you knock back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These matters will be considered by the minister, as he said. I am sure they will be considered by the cabinet. With the difficulties that are there, we will certainly try to ensure that the private health funds are maintained in a solvent state. I have no doubt about that whatsoever. It is essential that they should be so because the continuation of the private hospital system of this country boosts the public hospital system because each one per cent, as you know, that goes out of private health insurance costs the states over $100 million in extra costs. So there are major problems as a result of this occurring. Certainly, the funds are probably in trouble, as they have stated.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to say that this was an important commitment that we took to the last election and it is one on which we have delivered. In 1992 the Industry Commission recommended that twice weekly mail deliveries be provided to remote Australia. They did that after travelling around the countryside and carefully examining the needs of people in remote areas and making a judgment about how we could improve the quality of postal services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6034">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party of course had some years to act on that. They simply chose to do nothing. Even after we had gone out there prior to the last election and said this was a very important recommendation, they thumbed their noses at the bush and of course they got their just deserts. People in rural Australia in this and in a whole host of other areas made it abundantly plain that they knew what Labor stood for: a few small elites in the capital cities and beyond that they could not give a damn. That is why we regarded this as a very important commitment and we were not prepared to ignore the opportunity to improve communications in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to announce that we have in fact now met that commitment, which enables the coalition government to deliver on yet another of a whole series of commitments to regional Australia. Australia Post polled those communities which previously had received only one roadside delivery a week. Where the majority of households in a location voted for an increase, twice weekly deliveries will now be implemented as delivery contracts are renewed. As a result, more than 1,400 households across Australia will receive twice weekly deliveries, at a cost of more than $1.4 million&mdash;households in some of the most remote areas of Australia, including Tibooburra, Cooktown, Oodnadatta, Mount Price and Wentworth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia Post, its agents and contractors are to be congratulated on assisting the government in delivering on this important election commitment to regional Australia. I see that Senator Bourne seems to have joined this emergency session of the sandpit club. I am surprised that she would not at least have, on behalf the Australian Democrats, been pleased about this good news for regional Australia. Australia Post is certainly one of Australia's best performing government business enterprises. It is respected around the world as a leading postal service. There is no doubt that its commitment to rural Australia is very much exemplified by this announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are of course looking at other ways in which postal services might be made even more efficient in order to boost consumer 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> welfare in the postal services sector. Not just in that sector but in a whole range of other areas the services that we have delivered in the bush are there as an enduring legacy of this government and stand in stark contrast to Labor's total failure to deliver in any of those major areas:  $1.25 billion over six years for the Natural Heritage Trust, $696 million on the national highway project, $112 million to roads of national significance, $36 million on the road safety black spot program, $11.8 million over three years for the supermarket to Asia strategy&mdash;the list goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that in the area of telecommunications there are a number of very important initiatives that we have taken in terms of upgrading the modernisation of the network, such as enabling people to get fast dial-up service to the Internet, and in a whole range of areas so that people are no longer treated as second-class citizens, as they had the pleasure of being treated for some 13 long years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just hope that Labor will learn its lesson.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here we go again, Madam President; the politics of envy. The opposition are obviously not prepared to recognise the disparity in government business enterprises and the private sector. As you well know, Telstra is, if not the largest company, probably the second largest company in Australia. Certainly in terms of employment levels it is in the top two or three. So I would have thought that it is very understandable indeed that the chief executive of one of Australia's largest corporations should have a salary level that is roughly commensurate with that on offer in the private sector. That has certainly not been the case to date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CEO's remuneration package is a matter between the Telstra board and the CEO. In other words, the government does not set it. However, Telstra advises that, compared to remuneration paid to CEOs of similar sized companies, Telstra's CEO is paid at the lower end of the salary scale. Telstra has also advised that for the financial year 1996-97 the CEO's remuneration of $1.4 million included a long-term incentive payment accumulated over three years. In previous years the CEO's salary has fluctuated largely as a result of incentive payments.</PARA>

I would have thought a female senator, of all senators, would have been concerned to see that women workers in particular had more choice than before. Under a union dominated award system women came off second best. The flexibility which Australian workplace agreements will give to workers, particularly women workers, is a great selling point to the Australian work force.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The senator is quite right in saying that fraud against the department is in fairly small proportions in terms of numbers. Unfortunately, however, it means a substantial amount of money in terms of cost to the taxpayer.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I wish that they would allow me to at least explain because clearly this is something that they do not understand despite their 13 years of being in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many people who are not committing fraud but who are breaking the social security laws to the extent that the taxpayer, their neighbour, is footing the bill for payment of entitles to which these people are not entitled. People are being paid more than they are entitled to or they are being paid an income support measure for which they have no entitlement at all. They have breached the act because they have not disclosed, for example, their earnings or their living situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your claim at the beginning was that most were due to mistakes or oversight by the department. If that is what you said you are wrong; that is something that I am advised is of the order of about four per cent maximum. Mostly we are talking about people who are breaking the law but they are not perhaps engaged in fraud. It is important, whatever happens, that we clean up the act so that the taxpayers are not spending money that they should not be spending on people who are not entitled. I have already told this parliament a few months ago that we are now saving $19 million per week on money that would have been going to people who are not eligible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agency has a responsibility to recover social security debts in a timely manner. Since 1987 legislation has been in place under which, where a customer has a social security debt and is due a tax refund, the refund may 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6043"> be garnisheed in order to repay some or all of the debt. In the majority of cases, tax garnishees were issued for debtors who had no withholdings or other recovery arrangements in place. In some cases customers who are having a portion of their current social security entitlement withheld as repayment towards a debt were subject to the garnishee action. Withholdings are generally limited to 14 per cent of fortnightly payments and, particularly for large debts, do not always represent a satisfactory recovery arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where a debtor's tax refund is garnisheed the debtor is notified in writing immediately thereafter and advised of review and appeal rights. In most cases, debtors have not disputed the action. However, where the debtor contacts the agency about the garnishee action, each case is assessed on its merits and, in special circumstances, partial refunds of the garnisheed amount have been negotiated.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in government want to encourage young people to undertake training or education to improve their job prospects. Early school leavers, as I have said in here several times before, are three times as likely to be unem 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ployed as those who finish with a qualification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are talking about training and education for 16&hyphen; or 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, that does not mean you have to stay in a school classroom. It is mischievous to suggest that that is the case. There are some exemptions, for example, for under 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds because of illness, homelessness, substance abuse, traumatic home circumstances, job loss or inability to secure an appropriate education place, or other circumstances which make it unreasonable for the young person to undertake full&hyphen;time education or training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many opportunities for young people to undertake meaningful education and training in and out of school. In 1996&hyphen;97 the government created 52,000 traineeship places, and that was an increase of 44 per cent over the previous year, the last year of the Labor government. There were more than 3,600 inquiries in the first week of the new apprenticeship scheme over the hotline that Dr David Kemp established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits to these young people from the youth allowance are important. There is less confusion about the different rates of payment and eligibility. It is across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board equal treatment of young people. Young people living away from home who are under 18 will receive a higher level of payment, including those who are exempt from full&hyphen;time study or the training requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor surely must understand the good sense behind the youth allowance. If you look at the mini budget back in 1987, the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, said it would remove the financial incentive for young people to leave the education system. He said the new structure was giving a positive message to those who leave school: either find work or undertake training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The social security minister at the time, Brian Howe, said about the new jobsearch allowance that he hoped would make a difference in removing disincentives, that the government was indicating to young people across Australia that it hoped and expected that young people will not spend lengthy periods of time on unemployment benefits but will get into training, remain in an education 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6044"> program or get some combination of education, training and work. He went on to say that he believed that the unemployment benefit for 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds was a payment that in many respects had sent the wrong signals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trouble is that they failed to achieve that common youth allowance, which means that there are no incentives to be unemployed; the incentives are all to maintain your contact with the training and education system. It would be very wrong for people like Mr Latham and Senator Murphy to be out there advocating that we keep the status quo. The current system provides more financial incentive for young people to go on the dole rather than undertake further education or training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is wrong to give young Australians the idea that they have to stay at school. They have a number of options, but they must acquire skills if they are going to have a chance in the Australia of the future.</PARA>

So the states found themselves suffering a reduction of hundreds of millions of dollars in funds to run their hospitals so that this government could extend a bribe to the people of Australia by saying, `If you just stop resigning from health insur

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the estimates hearing, Senator Herron attempted to deal with this issue and he has again attempted to deal with it today but he has totally failed. He gets up in here and engages in rhetoric about hypocrisy and so forth but the hypocrisy on this issue is demonstrated very clearly by the minister and by this government&mdash;the people who claimed that they had the answers.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are confident that the incentives package and other reforms we are making,  including the Medicare levy surcharge on high&hyphen;income people who do not have health insurance, will stabilise the level of private health cover from the beginning of July when people will be able to have their premiums discounted by their fund.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Just prior to 1 July there were reports in the newspapers that thousands upon thousands of people were making inquiries to funds to take out membership in anticipation of the introduction of the levy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the reality? The reality is that fund membership is still declining and it is declining at a rate that is no better&mdash;in fact in some cases it is worse&mdash;than it has ever been. We also have this despicable spectacle of the funds making further applications for increases. Only recently we have had an announcement that MBF would be seeking a 15 per cent increase in its premiums as well as the introduction of a $50 per night levy for beds in private hospitals. This comes on top of another 15 per cent increase that was approved by the government back in February&mdash;all in all, total increases that will amount to over $300 per year, already in excess of the $250 that a couple would receive in a rebate

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Forshaw has not woken up to the fact that the cost of a bed day in a public hospital is much higher than the cost of a bed day in a private hospital for the same procedure. I would ask you, Senator Forshaw, to go back to the books and go back to the figures and check that out because it gives the lie to your statement that, in some way, the changes that we are introducing are taking funds from the taxpayer and giving them to the private system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is cheaper to run the private system, Senator Forshaw. If you check the figures, Senator Gibbs, you will see that it is. The cost of a bed day in a private hospital is much smaller than in a public hospital because of the quite legitimate concerns that public hospitals have in relation to the training of medical students, the teaching of registrars and the research that goes on in those public institutions. We tried to tell the Labor Party year after year after year, but there was a fundamental lack of understanding because they were driven by the philosophical approach that Medicare and the full public care of patients were going to be better in the long run. The philosophical drive of the Labor Party led them to that end. They did not realise that the competition provided in and between private hospitals and in and between private hospitals and the public hospitals would lead to greater efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more we promote people into the private system the better it is for the taxpayer, Senator Forshaw.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important issue, as everybody here agrees. The test, perhaps, is the fact that people are not going into the private funds. In fact, they are leaving them. There are many reasons for that, some of which have been debated here today. One reason is this: there is a problem not only with the private health cover premiums but also with the amount you have to pay if you do go into hospital. People go into hospital under a private insurance scheme and find that the insurance scheme does not cover the cost of the various procedures that are carried out. So, in addition to the premiums that you have to pay, you have to pay quite substantial sums in addition to the amount given by the private health cover. That is a problem. You have to pay the premium and also that additional amount.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can go into the history of what happened over 13 years under the previous government and what is happening under this one, but the big issue&mdash;Senator Herron would know this better than most&mdash;is that health cover and health care be provided so that all citizens can go about their lives knowing that they will be properly cared for. That is not happening now. Indeed, the system is only running because it is subsidised by those carrying out medical care. The nurses in Victoria are a prime example of how that has happened in recent times. They got to the point where they could not afford to carry the system in the way they had been up to that time. They had to take action&mdash;quite militant action as it turned out in the end&mdash;to get what was properly theirs. Another example of how the system is subsidised by the health carers is the young doctors who now do not get a provider number&mdash;an entitlement taken away by the present government. Those young doctors are working hours and hours to keep the system going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This problem will not be solved by the government and its representatives in this chamber getting up and saying, `We are doing our best. We are going to give a $450 rebate to taxpayers who take out private insurance.' That is a token, and no more than a token,

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One idea I had which had no chance of ever being accepted by my caucus or cabinet colleagues was to charge an increased Medicare levy for high&hyphen;income earners who refused to take out private insurance. I was never comfortable with the thought of wealthy people elbowing battlers out of queues in public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Former Senator Richardson, as health minister, was unable to get that through the Labor caucus. He thought it was fair; caucus thought, `No, we can't do that to the high income earners.' Former Senator Richardson went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everyone has to lose some battles but I wish I had won this one. Now the Liberal Party is putting forward the same idea. Even the thought that the Liberals are prepared to make the rich pay more when the Labor Party would not is enough to scare the hell out of me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There can be no doubt about where the great majority will stand on this. The vast numbers of Australians earning less than $50,000 a year will reckon that those earning more and able to afford more ought to be paying more. They will be even more convinced of the worth of this proposal if the Coalition adopts the rest of my proposal as well.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But it is interesting because Senator Richardson, in commenting on the Lawrence reforms&mdash;reforms that were an absolute and utter disaster, a total failure&mdash;also went on to say that `they are also not allowed to believe that the public hospital system will ever find itself unable to cope with the influx of formerly insured citizens, which one day will create one hell of a problem'. These quotes come from the Labor Party side. Why can't the Labor Party recall this information?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, it was the previous Labor government which, as I say, took $846 million out of the private sector. They abolished the bed day subsidy, which Senator Forshaw does not even know about; his eyes

These are fundamental changes which were made by the Labor Party that have seen the demise of the private health insurance scheme. Also, of course, they required the funds to pay a 25 per cent gap for medical benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have a situation where the Labor Party are accusing the coalition government, in some weird and wonderful way, of creating a disincentive by providing families with $450 towards their private health insurance. It is totally and utterly illogical. Yet this comes from a party that did not reject one request from the private health insurance companies for fee increases during their 13 years of rule of this country&mdash;not one request was rejected. The Labor Party will not acknowledge that&mdash;and yet they allowed every single solitary request to go through, with no incentive having been provided to individuals or families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 25 per cent of pensioners who have private health insurance deserve assistance. Yet the Labor Party are still saying that they will not provide it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The incentive package rebate scheme, which was launched only two months ago, is in dire trouble.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've got to look seriously at how to get the numbers in private health cover up.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He said, `The drop last year was dramatic.' He was indicating then in 1993 that the health system was unworkable or in danger if we dropped below 30 per cent of people in private health insurance. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  on 22 July 1993, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I told the private health insurance industry in a meeting on Monday this week that I regard it as my task as health minister to ensure that we stop the reduction of health insurance coverage and turn it around to get more people back in by the end of this three years, and we will.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was prior to the election. They did not do that. All we saw was a continual and steady decline at a very rapid rate in the number of people in private health insurance&mdash;down from 64 per cent to half that number by the time they left office. In May 1995, former Minister Lawrence, after bringing in the changes and trying to cover the gap by getting doctors under contracts, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It won't be immediate and in the short term before legislation starts to operate we will see increases in the number of people dropping out, so give it a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> year or two before you start to see the floor that we are hoping to place on it actually start to operate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It has not started to operate. The legislation is still in place and I think something like 80 doctors have signed up under this wonderful initiative that was instigated under Labor to try to do something about the very problem that the people on the other side are talking about. People get a shock when they go into hospital and find that there is a gap, that their hospital expenses are totally covered but their medical expenses are not. They also get a shock to find that their doctors charge them more than Medicare or the hospital fund will rebate. The Labor Party tried to bring in this initiative. We told them it would not work but they were going to bring it in and they were going to bring the doctors to heel. What happened? Nothing; and we have seen a decline in private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Knowles has pointed out, we have brought in a rebate for people on low incomes who take out private health insurance. Let me tell you that had the Labor Party been in the premiums would have gone up and up and you would not have had your $250 if you were single or your $450 if you were a family. Those opposite do not sit on this side. We need to know whether, if they got back into government, it would be their policy to take away the rebate. The question is: where are their policies? They do not have policies; they are devoid of them and they do not know whether they would take it out or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So private health insurance fees went up as a result of Labor's legacy of neglect of the health system for 13 years; and Labor have no policy about what they would do if they got back in&mdash;whether they would give a subsidy or not. Senator Gibbs says that in the last quarter there has been a decrease in the number of people in private health insurance. Let me tell you that those figures were taken before the initiative of the rebates came into effect, so the figures do not actually have anything to do with the initiative in terms of the rebates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also talked about the fact that the private health insurance premiums had gone up. They went up 12 per cent per annum 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6052"> under Labor. Did we hear any of them screaming out and saying it was terrible, and did we see them stopping it? Not once did one private health insurance fund come to the then Labor government, ask for an increase and have Labor reject it&mdash;not once. Every single time Labor approved the increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last quarter there has been a decrease in the number of people insured but it is based on figures, as I said, taken before the rebate initiatives started. It is the lowest decrease for seven years. In the 15 months since we have been in government there has been a 1.9 per cent drop&hyphen;out rate. In the last 15 months of Labor there was a 2&half; per cent drop&hyphen;out rate. So we are starting to see a reduction in the number of drop&hyphen;outs. As the rebate initiatives start to take effect, we will expect to see some change. But you cannot turn the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS> around.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6053"> in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable `active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator Patterson</NAME><FROM>(from five citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> determination, collection, and administration of the 100% franchise fees windfall tax which applies to business franchise fees paid before 5 August 1997 which are refunded by a State or Territory.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Sales Tax Bills modify the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 to impose a 15% increase in the rate of sales tax on alcoholic beverages There are also consequential amendments to the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 as a result of the increase in the rate of sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposals were announced by the Treasurer on 6 August 1997 in response to a recent High Court decision which held that certain State and Territory franchise fees are invalid under section 90 of the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reasons for urgency: The proposed Franchise Fees Windfall Tax Bills will apply from 5 August 1997. The proposed Sales Tax Bills will apply to dealings from 6 August 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bills are part of a package of legislation to protect State and Territory revenue. The States and Territories are relying on the legislation to protect their current financial year revenues. To provide certainty it would be desirable if final legislation could be enacted at the earliest opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Result if the proposed Bills are not dealt with in the Spring Sittings: State and Territory revenue would be greatly affected. There would also be continuing uncertainty for taxpayers. Taxpayers could also face difficulties in organising their affairs and in complying with the law.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am taking this opportunity of the tabling of the Reserve Bank annual report to speak about the very worrying inadequacies concerning the composition and method of operation of the Reserve Bank board. There are three aspects I want to concentrate on today: firstly, the fact that the membership of the board is extremely unbalanced; secondly, that the board's governance and modern systems of board accountability are lacking; and, thirdly, that existing practices confirm a clear danger that conflicts of interest and insider trading may be possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will deal with issue of the board's membership first. Essentially, this is a male board&mdash;at a ratio of 10:1&mdash;and is heavily weighted towards big business making up the majority and Public Service appointees in the minority. In the new year, the government will be appointing two replacement board members to the 11&hyphen;member Reserve Bank board. My personal view is that those two appointees should be women to redress the unacceptable gender bias on the board. It is also my personal view that the board interests should be balanced by those two appointments originating from two of the following three sectors: small business, unions, or community and social justice organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are no formal qualification criteria for the appointment of directors to the board of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6059"> the Reserve Bank of Australia. Mr Greg Smith from Treasury said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Basically the person is required to be suitably qualified and without unacceptable conflicts of interest in relation to banking activity or taxation matters.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He or she must also not be a member of the finance sector, as laid out by the relevant act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the second problem&mdash;poor governance and the lack of modern board accountability mechanisms&mdash;on 31 July I put questions on notice concerning the RBA board to be answered prior to the August estimates committee meeting, which they were. I followed this up with estimates questions on 18 August 1997, some of which are still on notice and remain to be answered. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record at E70 to E73 records my exchanges with the RBA board director, Mr Evans, who also heads Treasury. What is fundamentally apparent from those questions and answers received to date is that the RBA board is singularly and inadequately managed in terms of potential conflict of interest matters, that it has inadequate governance procedures and woefully inadequate practices concerning potential conflict of interest situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area I wish to comment on relates to the recent publicity surrounding the gold sale by the RBA and the substantial coincidental and simultaneous benefit that one company, whose chief executive officer is also a member of the RBA board, achieved between the time of the RBA board gold sale decision and its public announcement some months later. That director of the board, Mr Hugh Morgan, was, at the same time, the active chief executive officer of a gold company which apparently sold a quarter of its stocks forward in the period affected by this decision and before its public announcement. It should be said, however, that forward sales of gold are standard practice for that industry and are in no way unusual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The media commentary was exceptionally concerned and it seemed to me that the media was worried that there may have been a perception of insider trading. However, they were extremely judicious and avoided making direct allegations&mdash;firstly, because they had 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> no proof; secondly, because they were no doubt afraid of being sued; thirdly, because the governor reassured them that everything was above board; and, finally, as I have said, because forward sales are indeed standard practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is: how does the Reserve Bank or parliament itself get to the bottom of a situation where a board member's company may be perceived by the public at large as possibly benefiting during a period when a decision is secret? I and the Australian Democrats have no proof of wrongdoing and make no inference of wrongdoing. However, the board has not appointed an independent person or persons to investigate the issue thoroughly to satisfy themselves, the media and the public that everything was indeed above board. We only have the word of the governor, which, with respect and quite frankly, is not good enough since he is an interested party in this matter and, as co&hyphen;director, is not independent enough to be seen to objectively consider the matters at hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats, in noting the inadequacies recently exposed in corporate governance on the Reserve Bank board, do urge the government to provide the board with proposed guidelines to prevent conflicts of interest or insider trading from occurring. To date, I am profoundly concerned at the lack of action of the government on this matter.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6060">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is often said that there is one matter parliamentarians seldom disagree about: their pay and their pensions. This report shows just how wrong that assertion is. The report deals with two matters: the parliamentary contributory superannuation scheme and the judges' pension scheme. There is little doubt that the parliamentary scheme needs reviewing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Superannuation and the nature of employment in the wider community have changed significantly in recent years. However, the scheme is now out of step with superannuation in the wider community. It is questionable, however, whether the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation was the best body to do such a review. Many senators, myself included, felt very uncomfortable about this reference because it required sitting parliamentarians to review their own entitlements. Nonetheless, we have done our best with what was always going to be a difficult reference. Unfortunately, we were not able to come up with a unanimous set of recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset, I should note that the Senate committee is unanimous in respect of the judges' pension scheme. This scheme serves important wider objectives, and we recommend that it be retained with minor modifications. The section of  the report that deals with parliamentary schemes is another matter. Essentially, members of the committee were in agreement that there is a need for reform and that the Remuneration Tribunal should play a role in parliamentary superannuation. However, coalition and Labor Party members put forward different views in the report about how the reform should be approached, and the Australian Democrats senator has chosen to put in a dissenting report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As most senators would be aware, the general public sees the parliamentary scheme as excessively generous. The media does its best to perpetuate this image by highlighting the cases of young defeated members of parliament, some of them former ministers, who are presumed to enjoy very substantial parliamentary pensions for the rest of their lives. In reality, many parliamentarians do not survive political life for long enough to enjoy 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the generous benefits the media is so willing to highlight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The average tenure of parliamentarians is tending towards shorter parliamentary careers for a variety of reasons, including an increasingly volatile electorate. Consequently, fewer parliamentarians will qualify for a pension. Nonetheless, parliamentarians can receive benefits that are generous by community standards&mdash;if they survive in politics for long enough. Contributors to this inquiry focused heavily on this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most people in the community are in accumulation schemes funded by contributions. Very few can obtain access to their benefits before the age of 55. The government has also moved to tighten up preservation requirements so that contributions made after 1 July 1999 will not be available until age 55. The government announced one exception to this rule: people can get access to their benefits early if they take them as non-commutable life pensions or annuities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the parliamentary scheme was not changed, parliamentarians who qualified for a pension would still be able to get their benefits early. However, it is quite unusual for trustees of funds to allow any benefits, let alone full pension benefits, to be paid before retirement age. It remains to be seen whether trustees will change their views as a result of the government's announcement. At this stage they have not, and the parliamentary scheme is therefore seen as excessively generous. There is a strong case for bringing it into line with prevailing practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is understandable that there are people in the community who resent the apparently generous superannuation provisions enjoyed by parliamentarians. The average Australian workplace is now much less stable than it was, and many people face an uncertain and volatile employment market. In many ways the rest of the community has caught up with the general lack of stability that has always characterised political life. However, you cannot consider superannuation in isolation. It has to be viewed in the context of overall remuneration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While there is no difficulty in attracting people to stand for parliament, many talented 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6061"> people will not contemplate parliamentary service. This is because the parliamentary remuneration, particularly at ministerial level, lags well behind what might be expected for similar levels of responsibility in the private sector and in some public sector positions. Conditions of service in parliament should not be such that talented people who could make a real contribution to political life are deterred from entering parliament. If we cut too hard into parliamentary superannuation, we may compound this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee agreed that the scheme has many significant shortcomings. It is out of step with community practice and standards in the wider community. It also does not necessarily serve its members well. There are some outdated provisions and attempts to achieve too much in relation to what a superannuation scheme could be expected to provide. There is also a lack of transparency in parliamentary superannuation, and this lack of transparency gives rise to much of the criticism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I noted earlier, Labor and Democrat members have different views, and I will let them speak for themselves. I do not wish to comment on the views of the Labor Party senators in detail. However, I think it is somewhat disappointing that they were unwilling to commit themselves to recommendations for reform rather than delegating responsibility to the Remuneration Tribunal without further comment. I think there was an expectation that we would come up with specific recommendations. While there were limits as to how far coalition senators thought they should go, we have attempted to offer some directions for reform. I thank my colleagues Senator McGauran and Senator Ferguson in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coalition senators believe that the first step in reforming the scheme should be to apply similar preservation standards to parliamentary superannuation as apply in the wider community. The coalition senators' major recommendation is that future members should not be able to access any pension benefit until they are 55. However, coalition senators acknowledge that there is a case for paying current members an actuarially discounted 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benefit if they leave parliament before they are 55 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coalition senators concur with the view put by several witnesses that the PCSS attempts to fulfil too many functions and considers the scheme should operate solely as a method of providing income for retirement. Coalition senators also consider that new parliamentarians should be offered the choice of opting out of the present PCSS in favour of a fully funded accumulation scheme or retirement savings account of their choice. This could become part of the establishment of a fully funded parliamentary scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If our recommendations are adopted, we consider that the new rules should coincide with the new preservation rules announced in the 1997-98 budget and commence from 1 July 1999. This date falls after the next scheduled election and would allow current members sufficient time to consider their options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very conscious that some of my colleagues will not be happy with aspects of the report. I regret that. It is difficult to turn your back on what is the norm in the wider community. In closing, I would like to turn to the Democrats' dissenting report. I regret that the Democrats approached this inquiry with a fixed agenda and, to achieve such an outcome, some of their assumptions were questionable. I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

This is the 25th report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and it deals with a difficult and vexed question relating to politicians' superannuation and the judges' pension scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6062">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report, as I said, is very comprehensive. If we look very briefly at the history of the parliamentary contribution superannuation scheme, we see that it commenced in 1948. Initially some of the reasons for the establishment of the scheme were that, firstly, for those entering parliament it often meant forgoing potential superannuation payouts from previous employers due to leaving that employer prior to retirement age; secondly, electoral and parliamentary demands reduced members' chances to re-establish careers when their parliamentary term was over; and, thirdly, there was the need to entice people into parliament who would not otherwise come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report does outline a number of major changes that have occurred to the scheme, particularly the commutation factor introduced in 1973 and changed in 1978. As Senator Watson has pointed out, the core feature of the parliamentary fund is that it is a defined benefit fund. The main issue of contention has been about what is an appropriate level of effective contribution by the taxpayer into that fund. There are a number of issues dealt with by the report and I am sure Labor senators were conscious of the changing and emerging trends in superannuation in this country, particularly since 1983. Up until that time superannuation was generally enjoyed by approximately 40 per cent of the Australian work force. We had the introduction of the superannuation guarantee, and that now covers nine out of 10 people in the Australian work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a significant number of defined benefit funds in the public sector&mdash;certainly those covering the current Public Service and in particular the military&mdash;which were established for quite valid reasons, given the context of the employment and the various difficulties in maintaining people within both the military and the wider public sector; and there has been a significant number of defined benefit funds of various levels of effective employer contribution for many years in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a number of changes to the legislation governing superannuation, one of which is I think perhaps the most import 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ant&mdash;the introduction of superannuation guarantee&mdash;to the extent that now nine out of 10 employees in this country do enjoy effective superannuation coverage. One of the other themes to emerge in recent times has been the issue of choice: how you can improve the flexibility of a member of a fund to have a greater role in the decision making about which fund they wish monies to be contributed to on their behalf and also to have a greater choice with respect to investments that occur through their fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Generally in Australia over the last 10 years or so there has been a move away from defined benefit funds towards accumulation funds. I think Senator Watson has referred to a number of the disadvantages that relate to defined benefit funds. Clearly there is an issue related to cost and there is an issue related to the transparency of such funds. As I said earlier, accumulation funds seem to be emerging rapidly as the major fund cover for the significant majority of Australian employees. There are certainly a number of advantages with respect to accumulation funds. The cost of an accumulation fund is much more measurable. The cost of an accumulation fund, by its very nature, is readily able to be identified and it is also more transparent. There are a number of disadvantages, and we deal with those in the report, particularly relating to issues such as conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the interesting facts that I was a little surprised at when considering this issue&mdash;I think it is on page 21 of the report&mdash;was an examination of the age of parliamentarians. This is an important statistic when attempting to measure in some way the future liabilities of the fund. I was a little surprised because I had assumed that the average age of politicians had dropped significantly in the last 20 or 30 years; but that does not appear to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Watson referred to earlier, there certainly was a recognition of the concern of the Labor members on the committee about whether the current fund is as relevant in today's world as it once was when compared to the emerging trends that I referred to in my earlier comments. The greatest difficulty that faced any politician serving on this committee 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6063"> was having to make quite specific recommendations for reform of the scheme that affects both the future entitlements and current entitlements of members of parliament&mdash;and perhaps, depending on how far some members of the committee may wish to go, past accrued entitlements of members of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons, the Labor members took a view, which is referred to in the committee report, that the independent Remuneration Tribunal set the conditions of employment of federal politicians in this country. The Remuneration Tribunal is independent and widely respected in its role. Again, the report draws attention to the fact that parliamentary superannuation has been determined by various acts of parliament, as amended, since its introduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Remuneration Tribunal has never had carriage of the detail of the superannuation fund covering members of federal parliament. The Labor senators believe that it is appropriate for the fund to be examined in light of the background that I have outlined. We believe that it is not appropriate for members of parliament to make specific recommendations about changes to the scheme. There would be a conflict of interest if members of parliament were to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather, we see it as the role&mdash;we hope that legislation is introduced to do this&mdash;of the Remuneration Tribunal, as the appropriate body, to make necessary recommendations to reform the scheme in light of that tribunal's independence. It has extensive experience with remuneration matters, and it has the ability to evaluate the totality of the scheme and its objectives. We have recommended accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe there is a case for reviewing the parliamentary contribution scheme. We have contributed extensively to the various chapters of the report. Labor senators are very conscious of the accusations of potential conflict of interest in making recommendations which could be seen as attempting to benefit members of parliament. It is best left to the independent tribunal which we believe is appropriate&mdash;that is, the Remuneration Tribunal. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Australian Democrats, Cheryl Kernot, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The terms of reference show that we seek to look at the fairness of the schemes, particularly in relation to the cost to the public purse and in relation to the benefits received by other citizens.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What is happening now is that the scheme we have in place is failing the test of fairness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fair to say, as Senator Watson has already indicated, that this inquiry was not welcomed by the major parties. Our recommendations, in so far as they would reduce to varying degrees the entitlements of parliamentarians, are not likely to be popular with many of our colleagues. However, in our view, the evidence to the committee was compelling in making the case for such a direction in reforming the scheme. I reject Senator Watson's suggestion that we came into this with a fixed agenda. We certainly had a very strong agenda, but it was not a fixed one. We listened to the evidence that was before us as did other members of the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our report expresses the very firm view that the scheme is too generous and that it is in urgent need of reform. The majority report goes some way to acknowledging the criticisms of the scheme, and it explores the inequities inherent in that scheme between members of parliament whose terms of office and retirement ages vary quite widely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, as we anticipated in drawing up those terms of reference, the report fails to tackle that more substantive issue to do with the level of public subsidy to the scheme. It shirks what we acknowledge is the very difficult, but nonetheless important, task of bringing that scheme much more in line with community standards whilst having proper regard for the unusual nature of parliamentary life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe that the evidence that the level of hidden public subsidy to the scheme is excessive is compelling. In our view, the majority report made a mistake in not recommending about the appropriateness of the level of public funding as outlined in the terms of reference. We share the majority report's concern about politicians voting on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6064"> their own remuneration and, for that reason, we support the view of the majority report that it would be appropriate for the tribunal to determine a fair level of superannuation benefits for parliamentarians. However, this review ought to take place in the context of a very clear direction from the parliament that the level of super benefits ought to be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We strongly disagree with the view that superannuation should be considered as part of a total remuneration package for parliamentarians, with the implicit view that any reduction in superannuation should be offset somehow by an increase in some other component of that package. As was noted in the majority report, the Remuneration Tribunal itself has expressed reservations about the total remuneration package approach to salaries. It argued that accountability is best served by the public knowing the purpose for which funds are available to parliamentarians, recognising the distinction between provisions directed to a parliamentarian's individual benefit and those expenses which are incurred in the discharge of electorate functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The total remuneration package approach to parliamentarians' remuneration would allow parliamentarians to arrange their remuneration to best suit their individual needs. This, for some, could mean minimising their tax obligations. It may be seriously questioned whether it is appropriate to consider a tax package at a time when the government, through the tax office, is trying to crack down on that sort of abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our submission recognised that remuneration arrangements for parliamentarians needed to balance several considerations: the need for office holders to be able to live appropriately but not ostentatiously whilst holding office, without the need for an independent income; the removal of any financial need of illicit income from misuse of office; the need for remuneration to be sufficiently attractive to provide an adequate consideration for qualified citizens to leave the private sector to enter parliament; and the need to be sufficiently modest to ensure that offices do not become a source of money making and that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the public has confidence that the remuneration levels are appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We felt that, based on these criteria and the evidence presented to the committee, there was a strong and compelling case for retaining parliamentary superannuation schemes. The longer a parliamentarian is in office the more distant, in most cases, they become from their profession or their occupation, making it very difficult to return successfully to that former work. Against this it should be noted that parliamentarians who take up senior ministerial office are able to develop new skills and contacts which very often result in better opportunities in career paths. But, on the whole, most parliamentarians do not move up into higher office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of our recommendations was that, in restricting the parliamentary contribution superannuation scheme to retirement income purposes and reducing the level of public subsidy, there should be introduced a separate and additional dislocation allowance to assist former parliamentarians in transition from office to the work force. We recommended that the scheme should be restructured as a fully vested accumulation scheme with the level of public subsidy being substantially reduced, as I said earlier, and with the government contribution becoming an appropriate multiple of the parliamentarians' 11.5 per cent contribution. We think that that redundancy function I mentioned earlier should be quite separate from the retirement function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also recommend that the government contribution should cease after 18 years and parliamentarians ought to be permitted to reduce their contributions to 5.75 per cent after 18 years of service, as at present; that membership of the scheme remain compulsory but, where a member can satisfy the trustees that they have adequate retirement savings already, they should be able opt out of the scheme thereby forfeiting the benefit of the government contribution; that the rule for survivor and invalidity benefits be reviewed; and that parliamentarians be able to make additional contributions if they so opt and be paid interest on those contributions.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6065">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is our view that the benefits under the scheme be paid as a pension actuarially determined, based on the value of the accumulated benefit when the parliamentarian retires or turns 55, whichever is later, with parliamentarians able to commute up to 50 per cent of their pension to a lump sum at present. Finally, we recommend that the new scheme apply equally to new and to current parliamentarians in respect of the future service. We believe that entitlements of existing members should be determined under the current scheme as at the date of the closure of the existing scheme, with the Remuneration Tribunal determining appropriate transitional arrangements. It is on this recommendation that we most depart from the other two reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all respects, the Democrats support the analysis and the conclusions in the recommendations of the majority report in relation to the judges' scheme.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report I have just tabled on behalf of the committee chair deals with a number of amendments to the convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals, the so&hyphen;called Bonn Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments propose the listing of two species of cetaceans in Appendix ii to the convention, one species of albatross in appendix I and ten species of albatross in Appendix ii.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the conference of the parties in April, Australia proposed the listing of the 11 albatross species, while the Netherlands proposed the listing of two northern hemisphere species. With the earlier listing of a northern hemisphere species, all 14 albatross species are now listed under this convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The dolphin and porpoise proposed for listing are rarely seen in Australian waters and little is known about them. Nevertheless, the committee believes that Australia should continue to collect information on these animals, and on other species not often found in our waters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the committee examined the 1996 subsidiary southern bluefin tuna agreement with Japan, seabird by&hyphen;catch was an issue of concern. We made particular reference to the fate of albatrosses which interact with long&hyphen;line fishing operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The latest listings provide another opportunity to re&hyphen;visit the subject. We need to be aware that fishing provides many jobs, directly and indirectly, and that too many constraints will have an impact on fishing as a business. At the same time, Australia is a signatory to the Bonn Convention and is therefore legally obliged to introduce and enforce measures which protect migratory birds like the albatross.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many Australians would be uncomfortable if this nation did not take appropriate steps. Our report supports the listings, and we believe that our 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6066"> recommendations will assist in carrying out this public duty more effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have therefore recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia continue its efforts to optimise membership of international agreements;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All commonwealth departments and agencies involved in managing our membership of the convention harness the available expertise in the most effective way;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian fisheries management authority (ALMA) examine the observer program to establish the costs and benefits of placing trained observers on all boats in Australia's fishing areas, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ALMA discuss with the tuna fishing industry the testing of such techniques as night setting of bait on the high seas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, we are concerned about three things.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, it is regrettable that the first national interest analysis (IN) which was tabled omitted the listing of the two species of cetaceans. I understand that the oversight occurred in spite of a number of organisations involved in the process asking the sponsor whether any other species were involved in these listings as well as the albatrosses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, we are concerned about the time it took to produce the record of the proceedings of the conference of parties. This ended in April and was still not available when the revised in was tabled in mid&hyphen;June.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While we have not made a recommendation on this matter, we have suggested that Australia should offer the secretariat to the conference whatever assistance it can to ensure the results of the conference are available as soon as practicable after its conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, we are still not satisfied with the amount and timing of the consultation involved in the process of parliamentary scrutiny of treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last Monday, in the course of some additional remarks in the other place on our eighth report, my colleague the honourable member for Moreton drew attention to two examples of inadequate consultation in areas where particular organisations should have been involved in the process. In the case of the Bonn Convention, such consultation as did occur about the listing of the cetaceans was probably later than desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contribution made by various NGOs to this inquiry, and to an earlier one on restrictions on the use of blinding laser weapons and landmines, was considerable and we thank them for their efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the latter, our fifth report, on the chair's behalf I would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the courageous efforts of the late Princess Diana of Wales and her written acknowledgment of the committee's work in this direction earlier this year.

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Radiocommunications (Spectrum Licence Tax) Bill 1997 seeks to apply an annual spectrum licence tax, to recover spectrum maintenance costs, to spectrum licences issued under the Radiocommunications Act 1992. The associated Radicommuni 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cations Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 will provide for collection of the tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Spectrum licensees benefit from spectrum maintenance practices such as international coordination, domestic planning, interference investigation and policy development carried out by the Spectrum Management Agency (SMA) (the Australian Communications Authority (ACA) from 1 July 1997) on behalf of all radiocommunications licensees. It is appropriate therefore that spectrum licensees should contribute to the recovery of associated costs, by paying a proportionate share of annual spectrum maintenance tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The collection of an annual spectrum maintenance tax was supported in the bipartisan HORSCOTCI Report "Management of the Radiofrequency Spectrum" in October 1991. However there is currently no provision for spectrum licensees to pay a spectrum maintenance tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apparatus licensees have always paid these maintenance costs. With the first spectrum licences being issued in 1997, this is the appropriate time to correct the anomaly between the two licensing systems. The proposed act will harmonise arrangements between apparatus licences and spectrum licences and will make transparent the share of the ongoing costs of spectrum management paid by spectrum licensees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now I turn to the details contained in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The actual amount of the tax will be set by a SMA determination, as is presently the case for apparatus licences. There will not be a set maximum limit on the tax that can be imposed on a licence holder. This is because of the highly flexible nature of spectrum licences. Such licences can, for example, be traded, sub&hyphen;divided and amalgamated, giving rise to the possibility that a single licensee could hold a large proportion of spectrum in a particular band.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the following checks will limit the degree of discretion the SMA has in setting the amount of the tax. Once made, any such determination will be a disallowable instrument. Furthermore, in order to limit the SMA's discretion to increase the tax, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, under section 235 of the Radiocommunications Act 1992, may give the SMA directions in relation to the performance of its functions and exercise of its powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the amendments I have outlined will enable all radiocommunications licensees to share the costs of the SMA providing an efficient spectrum management service in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The collection of an annual spectrum maintenance tax was supported in the bipartisan HORSCOTCI Report "Management of the Radiofrequency Spectrum" in October 1991. However, there is currently no provision for spectrum licensees to pay a spectrum maintenance tax.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FAMILY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill gives effect to a number of measures announced in the Government's 1997&hyphen;98 Budget, a measure announced in the 1996&hyphen;97 Budget, the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> introduction of a maternity immunisation allowance that forms part of the Government's strategy to improve the rate of child immunisation in Australia and to a number of non&hyphen;Budget measures that will assist in more effective and efficient social security administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under current arrangements, family payment above the minimum rate can be paid for up to 13 weeks when one or both parents go overseas temporarily, providing the child stays in Australia. However, if the child goes overseas, family payment above the minimum rate is not paid and families currently receive only the minimum rate of family payment. This can cause the family financial stress.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the measures announced in the 1997&hyphen;98 Budget provided for the Social Security Act 1991 to be amended to allow above the minimum rate family payment to be paid for up to eight weeks when either the parent or child, or both, go overseas temporarily. The bill provides for this, effective from 1 January 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another 1997&hyphen;98 Budget measure included in this bill will allow better targeting of family payment and maternity allowance to those in need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that from 1 January 1998, the hardship provisions that apply for family&hyphen;related payments will be amended so that families with an assets value between $406,000 and $602,500 will qualify for minimum family payment only if their family income is at or below the point at which income reduces family payment to the minimum rate (currently $27,125 plus $4,399 for each child after the first child). As qualification for maternity allowance is based on qualification for family payment, those families who do not receive family payment because of this initiative will also not qualify for maternity allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third 1997&hyphen;98 Budget measure to be implemented by this bill provides for amendments to be made to social security and veterans' affairs legislation so as to remove the entitlement to rent assistance, from 1 January 1998, of persons who live in public housing but do not pay rent directly to the public housing authority (other than those who live in public housing where market rent is being charged).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides for the implementation, from 1 January 1998, of a 1996&hyphen;97 Budget measure that will extend the range of employer provided benefits currently taken into account in the income test for family payment, maternity allowance and childcare assistance. This extension will cover employer provided benefits received by an employee in the form of financial investments (including units in cash management trusts), as well as reimbursements to an employee for expenses incurred for his or her private use.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia currently has an immunisation rate of 53 per cent according to the recommended schedule for children 0&hyphen;6 years. This is not good enough. We need to implement a strategy that will lift immunisation rates to an acceptable level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of that strategy, this bill provides for the introduction of a maternity immunisation allowance. The maternity immunisation allowance will be payable in respect of children born on or after 1 January 1998 and who, having reached 18 months of age, have received age&hyphen;appropriate immunisation up to that stage (unless the child is otherwise exempted from the requirement). The maternity immunisation allowance of $200 will be payable in addition to a maternity allowance of $750 that will be payable following the birth of such a child.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maternity immunisation allowance will also be paid in addition to the maternity allowance, in respect of stillborn children or children who die before reaching 18 months of age.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A maternity allowance, currently $870.30, will continue to be payable following the birth of a child who is born on or after 1 February 1996 but before 1 January 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of non&hyphen;Budget measures included in the bill will impact on family&hyphen;related payments. These are aimed at ensuring more equitable and efficient delivery of services to families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of other non&hyphen;Budget measures included in the bill deal with disability&hyphen;related payments. Two such measures provide for the introduction of revised impairment tables for disability support pension and the subsuming of disability wage supplement into disability support pension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The assessment processes for disability support pension will be tightened to ensure that those people whose impairments have only a relatively small impact on their overall inability to work will not qualify for that pension. Rather, they will receive a more appropriate income support payment. To assist in this process, revised impairment tables, which are used to assess whether a person's impairment is 20 points or more, are being introduced. These revised impairment tables are a refinement of amendments that were previously proposed in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 and take account of submissions received from thirty eight peak disability and welfare groups. The major changes between the revised tables as proposed in 1996 and those included in the bill are the re&hyphen;introduction of some minor impairment scores and the clarification of issues such as `enforced' treatment, `double assessing', assessing fatigue and investigations to be undertaken by medical officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disability wage supplement was established in June 1994 as a separate payment for people with disabilities participating in the Supported Wage 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> System, a productivity&hyphen;wage based system administered by the Department of Health and Family Services. Currently, people in receipt of disability support pension who commence employment through the Supported Wage System are required to transfer to disability wage supplement, even though the qualification criteria for the two payments are very similar. Many customers have expressed a reluctance to make this transfer and a preference to continue to receive disability support pension. The take&hyphen;up of disability wage supplement has been very slow, with less than 300 customers in receipt of this payment two years after its inception.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for disability wage supplement to be subsumed into disability support pension from 1 January 1998. All existing disability wage supplement customers will be transferred to disability support pension and the disability support pension provisions amended so that participation in the Supported Wage System will be an alternative qualification criterion to a person having a continuing inability to work because of an impairment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another non&hyphen;Budget measure included in the bill provides for amendments to be made to the Social Security Act so as to provide for a new method of determining the value of a payment received by a customer in a foreign currency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing method set out in the Social Security Act for the conversion of foreign currency for income test purposes has not been used because of system limitations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new method proposed in the bill extends the conversion of foreign currency to all social security payments, not just social security pensions, and to all foreign currencies. There will also be a requirement to apply an appropriate exchange rate from the first social security pension payday each month.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two recent Federal Court decisions have considered legal questions concerning entitlement to rent assistance where entry contributions are paid to retirement villages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the unreported decision of Department of Social Security v. Knight, it was held that regular instalments paid by Mrs Knight as part of her entry contribution to a retirement village were rent. Accordingly, Mrs Knight was entitled to rent assistance in respect of those payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was never intended that any amount that could be regarded as all or part of an entry contribution, however payable, was rent. Accordingly, it is proposed to amend the Social Security Act to clarify the original intention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In another unreported decision, Secretary, Department of Social Security v. Montgomery, it was held that notional annual deductions from the refundable portion of an entry contribution were not rent. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6070"> Although this decision accords with the intention of the legislation, the bill amends the Social Security Act so as to establish beyond doubt that such notional deductions are not rent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Act 1996 implemented amendments to the Social Security Act and the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973, from 20 March 1997, that allow the backdating, through the deemed earlier lodgement of a claim, in circumstances where the person makes a telephone inquiry about claiming payment and then formally lodges a claim and qualifies for disability support pension, sickness allowance, newstart allowance or youth training allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill builds on those measures so as to extend the telephone lodgment provisions to carer payment, partner allowance and parenting allowance. The bill also extends the ambit of these provisions to include contact by facsimile and computer. This "extension" will apply not only for carer payment, partner allowance and parenting allowance but also to the payment types to which the telephone lodgment provisions originally applied.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is intended to ensure that small businesses are exempted from the federal unfair dismissal provisions, in respect of new employees. This exemption is necessary and appropriate, given the special features of small business&mdash;and it is necessary, to ensure continuing growth in employment in small business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators will be aware that the Government's commitment to an unfair dismissal exemption for small business was announced on 24 March 1997, as part of the Government's small business statement, and that a regulation was made under the Workplace Relations Act 1996, to give effect to such an exemption, which was to take effect from 1 July 1997. Senators would also be aware that this regulation was disallowed by the Senate on 26 June 1997. As a result, this bill was introduced later on the same day into the House of Representatives to give effect to the Government's intentions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, as the Prime Minister said in launching the Government's small business statement, helping small business to grow, employ, export and invest in Australia's future has been a top priority for the Government since its first day in office. The Government's economic and industrial relations policies are central to its agenda for the growth and development of the small business 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sector&mdash;and the Government is also committed to tackling the impediments to small business imposed by unnecessary government regulation and paperwork, as set out in the small business statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has, of course, already made substantial progress in labour market reform, which is and will be of particular benefit to small business. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996 has changed the federal industrial relations system, and the relationship between federal and state industrial relations systems, providing small business with greater opportunities to develop industrial relations arrangements best suited to their individual circumstances. In particular, small business employers have new opportunities to make direct agreements with their employees. Small businesses that choose to remain in the award system are benefitting from a simplified and more flexible system; small businesses now have greater certainty with respect to industrial action within their business; the Employment Advocate has been given a specific charter to assist small business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, unfair dismissal was one of the most important industrial relations issues for small business, prior to the last election. Our commitment, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better Pay for Better Work</EMPHASIS> , was to introduce a new unfair dismissal scheme, which would recognise the circumstances facing small business: and we have done this. The new system is more balanced and fair to both employers and employees. It is less legalistic and costly, with an emphasis on conciliation. Employers are protected from frivolous and malicious claims by the requirement for a filing fee and access to costs where a claim is vexatious. In considering unfair dismissal claims, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has to consider a range of factors, including the possible effect of any order on the viability of the employer's business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, these changes are important&mdash;but they have not gone far enough, for small business. It is an unavoidable fact that the defence of an unfair dismissal claim, however groundless, is especially burdensome for small businesses. In many larger businesses, expertise and resources can be put into recruitment and termination procedures. Small businesses have no such resources. Even attendance of witnesses at a hearing can bring a small business to a standstill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has been listening to the concerns of small businesses, their experiences of the impact of unfair dismissal claims (particularly under the previous Government's provisions), and their fears that the simple fact of employing someone makes them vulnerable to unfair dismissal claims. The Government was mindful of all of these concerns and fears in the development of last year's legislation: the issue was amongst those raised in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6071"> Government's discussions with the Australian Democrats, and the scope for additional exemptions, by the regulations, was always there, as part and parcel of the act's provisions on termination of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 170CC of the act allows for exclusion of `employees in relation to whom the operation of the provisions causes or would cause substantial problems because of . . . the size or nature of the undertakings in which they are employed'. And this language is drawn directly from the International Labour Organisation's Termination of Employment Convention, 1982, which expressly allows exclusions of this type.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our announcement of the small business exclusion on 24 March 1997 was welcomed by small business. Rob Bastion of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia said `That's obviously the jewel in the crown . . . that is the one which will actually create jobs . . . I'm certain of it'. And, Madam President, this is the crucial point&mdash;this exemption is not just about removing a burden from small business, it is about the positive employment benefits of the expanded job opportunities that will surely result from the removal of that burden.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the terms of the bill itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exemption is to commence on Royal Assent. However, it will not affect existing employees. As it is intended to encourage new employment, the exclusion will only apply to employees who are first engaged by the relevant employer after the commencement of the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exemption is from the federal unfair dismissal provisions, only. Employees will still be protected by the Workplace Relations Act. Section 170CK protects employees against dismissal because of any discriminatory reason. Sections 170MU and 170WE prohibit dismissal of an employee because the employee engages in protected industrial action, seeking a certified agreement, or AWA industrial action. Section 298K, in the freedom of association part of the act, prohibits dismissal which involves victimisation, or is otherwise contrary to freedom of association. And section 170CM prohibits dismissal without 1&hyphen;5 weeks notice (depending on the employee's length of service and age), or pay in lieu, except in cases of serious misconduct.The exemption also does not affect the rights of apprentices in small businesses, who have a particular need for protection, given the additional impact that any break in the continuity of their employment may have, in terms of attainment of qualifications. This bill will not affect existing rights in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exemption applies only to businesses employing 15 or fewer employees. This size of small business was chosen because of the precedent 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provided by the Employment Protection Act 1982 (NSW), introduced by the Wran Government, and followed by the then Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in the 1984 Termination, Change and Redundancy Test Case. An exemption for businesses of this size will benefit a substantial proportion of all businesses in the federal jurisdiction, but will not cover too many businesses of such a size and complexity that they are likely to have a separate management structure (which would facilitate defence of unfair dismissal claims).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that, in counting the number of employees in a business, casual employees are only to be counted if they have been engaged on a regular and systematic basis for at least 12 months. The intention of this exclusion is to reflect the fact that a business which occasionally engages additional casual employees is not necessarily a large business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will have no significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill has two main purposes: first, to put in place arrangements for the provision of general revenue assistance to the states and territories in 1997-98, consistent with decisions reached at the 1997 Premiers' Conference and related agreements with the states and territories; and secondly to provide authority for the Commonwealth to pay the states and territories the revenue it collects under the safety net arrangements which are being implemented to protect State and Territory revenues following the High Court decision of 5 August on State business franchise fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994. The existing act covers the provision of financial assistance grants and special revenue assistance for 1996-97 only, with interim arrangements for the continuation of payments for a maximum of six months. The bill extends for a further 12 months the provisions of the act relating to the payment of financial assistance grants and special revenue assistance, and specifies State and Territory entitlements in 1997-98 to payments under the safety net arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general revenue assistance to be appropriated by this bill is about $16.8 billion, or around 12 per cent of estimated Commonwealth outlays in 1997-98. Accordingly, these payments constitute a significant element of the Commonwealth Budget and have an important bearing on the spending and borrowing of the public sector as a whole. The states and territories are able to allocate the funds provided by the Commonwealth under this act according to their own budgetary priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the bill appropriates revenue replacement payments to the states under the safety net arrangements estimated to exceed $5 billion in 1997-98. The safety net arrangements are revenue neutral for the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the elements of the bill which give effect to decisions of the 1997 Premiers' Conference and related agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1997 Premiers' Conference agreed that the states and territories will be provided with real per capita growth in financial assistance grants in 1997-98 and that the real per capita guarantee for financial assistance grants will be extended to 1999-2000. Amendments to the act are consistent with the per capita element of the real per capita guarantee being conditional on states meeting the terms of the Agreement to Implement the National Competition Policy and Related Reforms. This Agreement also provides for the commencement of $214.7 million in competition payments to the states and territories in 1997-98. On 7 July 1997, the Treasurer announced that in light of the National Competition Council's report on competition policy reform, each State will receive the per capita element of growth in financial assistance grants and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an equal per capita share of a total amount of $214.7 million in competition payments in 1997&hyphen;98.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the 1997 Premiers' Conference it was decided that the states and territories would make fiscal contribution payments of $626.5 million in 1997-98 and $313.5 million in 1998-99. It was also agreed that half of the scheduled 1997-98 fiscal contributions of Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory will be deferred until 1998-99 in recognition of their difficult economic circumstances. The need for the 1998-99 fiscal contribution will be reviewed at the 1998 Premiers' Conference in light of developments in the Commonwealth's fiscal position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will continue to provide states and territories with maximum flexibility concerning the method of payment of the State fiscal contributions. A State's share can be paid by way of deductions from general revenue assistance, direct payments to the Commonwealth or a reduction in funding provided under a specific purpose grant. Provisions have been included in the bill for states' 1997-98 fiscal contributions to be deducted from general revenue assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major part of the assistance provided under this bill is the provision to each State and Territory of a share of the pool of financial assistance grants which is estimated to be about $16.1 billion in 1997-98. In accordance with the agreement at the 1996 Premiers' Conference, this amount includes the grants that were previously paid to the states as arterial road grants. The 1997 Premiers' Conference agreed that the distribution of financial assistance grants should be in accordance with the per capita relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The bill updates the per capita relativities in the act accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill authorises the payment of special revenue assistance to New South Wales and Victoria of $435.5 million in 1997-98 as payments under the guarantee arrangements associated with the Medicare Agreements. The Commonwealth will fund $62.2 million of these payments and the residual will be funded from the financial assistance grants pool.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Capital Territory will also receive $34.5 million from the Commonwealth in 1997-98 in the form of transitional allowances and special fiscal needs. This payment is outside the scope of this bill and has been included in the Appropriation bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the elements of the bill which relate to the safety net arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As announced by the Treasurer on 6 August, the Commonwealth has agreed to introduce safety net measures to protect State and Territory revenues following the High Court decision of 5 August on State business franchise fees. The High Court 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6073"> decision affects annual State revenues of around $5 billion and leaves the states open to refund claims, amounting to many billions of dollars, in respect of past business franchise fee payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will use its tax powers to collect the revenue that the states and territories previously collected by way of business franchise fees on petroleum products, tobacco and alcoholic beverages. The states and territories acknowledge that this will represent a State tax imposed and collected by the Commonwealth at their request and on their behalf. The safety net arrangements are intended to be temporary and will be reviewed within six months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments provide authority for the Commonwealth to pay the states and territories the revenue it collects under the safety net arrangements, expected to exceed $5 billion in 1997-98. It is intended that revenue replacement payments be made together with the Commonwealth's weekly payments of general revenue assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some states will receive more revenue than they previously raised under their business franchise fees. This is necessary if no State or Territory is to be worse off as a result of the High Court decision since the Australian Constitution requires that the Commonwealth apply taxes uniformly across the states whereas states' business franchise fees vary in their rates and coverage. However, the states and territories have indicated that these excess revenues will be refunded to manufacturers or wholesalers in order to avoid as far as possible price increases for consumers and petroleum users. To ensure the safety net arrangements operate as intended, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is monitoring price movements of affected products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments also include a provision which returns to the states any tax revenues the Commonwealth might receive under the Franchise Fees Windfall Tax (Collection) Act 1997. This will ensure that State finances are protected from claims for refunds, on grounds of constitutional invalidity, of past payments of business franchise fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I noted earlier, the safety net arrangements are revenue neutral for the Commonwealth. Revenue replacement payments will simply return to the states amounts raised by the Commonwealth on their behalf, after allowing for Commonwealth administrative costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is vital to the integrity of State and Territory finances that legislation to give effect to the safety net arrangements is enacted without delay. Accordingly, the Government is giving this bill&mdash;and the associated revenue bills&mdash;the highest priority.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The claimed reason for the regulation is to reduce the level of abuse of the refugee status determination procedure. However, Mark Sullivan, Deputy Secretary of DIMA, told Senator McKiernan at the Senate estimates committee on 11 June 1997 that the regula 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6074"> tions have broader application than those considered to be abusing the system. So it is clearly acknowledged at the highest levels of government that the regulations will have a deleterious effect on bona fide asylum seekers. Indeed, it is understood that these regulations are already having that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also in the Senate estimates hearing of 11 June, Mark Sullivan from DIMA defined abuse as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person who applies for a protection visa, knowing that they are seeking not protection but the coverage of what a protection visa in process offers them, is committing an abuse. . . . It does not include people who make applications in good faith.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet the punitive scope of the regulations extends beyond those making abusive claims for protection and, although it was conceded by DIMA that there is no provision for waiver in cases where an application is found not to be frivolous, carefully drafted alternative regulations designed to target abuse but not punish bona fide users were not even considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is apparent that the only study of abuse that has been made is one that equates `abusive' with `unsuccessful'. So these regulations have been passed without any meaningful study having been done regarding the extent of abuse, the nature of it and the most effective way of addressing the problem without prejudicing those seeking protection in good faith. The best the Deputy Secretary for DIMA could do was describe:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an escalation in the number of claims from nationalities for which there is little experience in Australia or internationally of found claims for protection and an increasing high rate of refusal at primary and review stage of such claims.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Whilst it may raise suspicions of abuse, this does not equate with abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Most particularly, it is noted that much of the blame of abuse is being levelled against unscrupulous agents. The unscrupulous agents in that context are the abusers, not those who are being exploited by them. What, one might ask, is being done about that? Nothing. It is clear that no study of levels of abuse applying the DIMA definition has been made. Indeed, the only report that might shed some light on what studies have in fact been done has, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> extraordinarily, been given the status of a cabinet&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence document notwithstanding the fact that it is the product of a `public review', as described by the minister in a media release dated 31 March 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what of the innovative ALP amendments? The government has agreed to abandon the least offensive of all the amendments&mdash;the 14&hyphen;day appeal to the RRT. Although it is accepted that this is a just result, overall it is a small victory&mdash;it was a meaningless provision that would have done little to shorten processing times. Contrary to its previous position, the ALP agreed to the continuation of the $1,000 penalty. Imposed only on persons unsuccessful in their refugee applications, it is manifest nonsense to call it other than a penalty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only changes are that there is a two&hyphen;year sunset clause and an agreement to refer the matter for an inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations in 1998. The implication of this is that there is effectively no change for people rejected at the primary stage until the sunset clause takes effect. The only outcomes are that the introduction of the sunset clause constitutes an admission as to the questionable efficacy of a provision that is clearly unjust, and the sunset clause confirms that persons refused refugee status by the Refugee Review Tribunal become the guinea pigs of all other ill&hyphen;considered and misconceived regulatory frameworks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is cold comfort to be bona fide asylum seekers now that the regulation will cease to have effect two years down the track. The penalty will still serve to intimidate or deter bona fide asylum seekers from accessing the review procedure and will penalise people who are not abusing the system. Although described as a fee, it would not serve the ostensible function of cost recovery. How many asylum seekers would be able to afford to pay the penalty, having been denied for the most part access to work rights as well as other forms of basic subsistence through the asylum seekers assistance scheme?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Asylum seekers cannot claim asylum seekers assistance for six months after they apply for refugee status, and access to ASAS 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6075"> ceases after a person is refused refugee status at the primary stage of a determination process even though the overturn rate of primary decisions is reasonably high, although there have been extremely rare exceptions. The 14&hyphen;day limit on work rights has been increased to 45 days. This makes little appreciable difference to most asylum seekers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP describes itself, in a most unjustified and self&hyphen;congratulatory way, as having introduced an innovative change&mdash;that is, if there is no primary decision within six months of application, the prohibition on work rights lapses. How innovative this is is highly questionable given the new measures that have been introduced to speed up primary processing times, such as reductions of interviews and the practice of rejecting people before they have even had a chance to obtain legal aid or to submit a declaration as to their claims. On top of this, even if the prohibition were to lapse after six months, to impose no work and no access to financial assistance for six months is perverse brutality. So much for the creative genius of the ALP!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether it be 14 days or 45 days, this regulation offers no discretions and no safety nets. Indeed, this provision is the most debilitating of all. It will ensure that all applicants&mdash;bona fide or otherwise&mdash;who apply more than 45 days after arrival will have no means whatsoever to sustain themselves independently of charities and community groups upon which there are already heavy demands. Similar measures in the United Kingdom were met with strong opposition from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, who described them as `constructive refoulement'&mdash;that is, returning refugees to frontiers where they could face well&hyphen;founded fear of persecution by forcing them into destitution and out of their country of asylum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments accommodate to some extent those making sur place claims&mdash;for instance, persons claiming to be refugees as a result of events arising in their country of origin after their arrival in Australia&mdash;for whom there would be a guarantee of priority processing, in individual cases, or scope, in the case of groups, for the minister to issue a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> gazettal notice waiving the prohibition on permission to work. This is reminiscent of old provisions that permitted people to stay in Australia on humanitarian grounds that were dependent on the minister's gazettal of a particular country as being one that breached human rights; a gazettal that never happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What, for example, would the minister do in the case of a coup in, say, Cambodia? Would the minister, in the interests of international relations and political expediency, decline to gazette a country thereby waiving the prohibition on permission to work for its nationals seeking protection? After all, the Australian ambassador in Phnom Penh has said that the coup leader is a `democrat at heart', and Minister Ruddock has already told Sam Rainsy, the leader of the Khmer Nation Party, that Australia is not going to interfere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several case studies illustrate the injustices that are already being perpetrated by these regulations. They demonstrate systemic problems with the operation of the regulations that, if they were not just simply overlooked, could have been foreseen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at case study No. 1, the holder of a business visa. A man came to Australia quite legitimately on a business visa. Through no fault of his own the business went bad and he lost his job. Unfortunately, his right of residency in a third country, not his country of origin, was conditional on the job. Loss of employment therefore led to loss of that right of residency. Although not his country of nationality, he had lived and worked there for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is in Australia on a three-month multiple entry visa, which was all he needed while he was undertaking his business activities, which involved international travel. However, if he leaves Australia now he is at risk of having his next entry denied on the basis of change of circumstances, which means that he must return to his country of nationality. He cannot return to the country where he previously held right of residency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Were he to return to his country of nationality he would most certainly be at risk of persecution. It is considered that he would stand a high chance of succeeding in a claim to refugee status. In the meantime he has been 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6076"> in Australia on business for more than 45 days in the past 12 months, which means that under the new regulations he cannot get permission to work. He has a wife and children to support, having relocated himself on the expectation that he was going to be here for some time. The loss of his job has also meant the loss of his income. He now has no income and substantial liabilities as a result of the relocation. He cannot support his family. He is, of course, ineligible for asylum seeker assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Case study No. 2 concerns X, a victim of torture and trauma. X is from Sri Lanka and was issued with a Sri Lankan temporary visa class 435, a visa designed to serve the humanitarian purpose of ensuring that Sri Lankans were not forced to return to their country, which is still experiencing a situation of generalised violence. Notwithstanding that there has been no perceptible change in the human rights situation in Sri Lanka, the minister decided not to extend the class 435 visas which expired on 31 July. The visa included, quite properly, permission to work. X had a job which gave him a modest income. Y was also the holder of the 435 visa but he could benefit from a ministerial announcement of 13 June which  declared him eligible to remain permanently in Australia under a new scheme. The situation for X, distinguishable from Y only by date of arrival rather than by any other circumstance, is that he is ineligible for the 13 June categories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No longer able to benefit from the protection available under the class 435 visa, but having claims to refugee status considered to be meritorious, X lodged a protection visa application. X had never sought advice. He had been hoping things would improve in Sri Lanka.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">X, of course, has been in Australia for more than 45 days. Now he finds himself in a situation of having no permission to work because it is prohibited while he applies for protection against gross violations of his human rights. While he waits for a decision, thanks to the coalition and its ALP lap dog, he is prohibited from supporting himself through gainful employment and has no right 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of access to basic subsistence support. Remember: he is already heavily traumatised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 45&hyphen;day time limit creates a presumption that those who do not apply within 45 days are not seeking protection in good faith. Experienced practitioners in the refugee field are able to say that, notwithstanding the change from 14 to 45 days in which to apply, few applicants would be able to learn about the process, find an adviser, make an application, find an interpreter and make an adequately prepared protection visa application within 45 days of arrival.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The asylum seeker is left with another hard choice: make an inadequately prepared application and get permission to work, or spend longer on preparing a thorough application and be denied work rights and therefore be condemned to destitution. To take the second choice is also to invite a conclusion that the application is not made in good faith. Whilst this is a nonsense and must be seen as such, it was not beyond the DIMA deputy secretary to start casting aspersions on the bona fides of people's claims on the strength of the time within which they made their application. Of people applying more than 14 days after arrival&mdash;as the time limit for permission to work then was&mdash;he said, `The question then is whether this person is seeking protection or seeking some other cover.' While he acknowledges that persons applying outside the time limit for permission to work may still have their refugee claims decided, it is clear from Mr Sullivan's statements that it is a small step for the department to take the view that a person seeking asylum after that time limit is therefore abusing the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to immigration cases, I have also been provided with some case studies that illustrate the impact of these changes. Case study No. 1 concerns A, who migrated to Australia on an independent visa during 1993. He came to Australia with his wife and two children. A is the sole breadwinner in the family and they are struggling to pay off a mortgage and meet the expenses associated with raising a young family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A's elderly parents applied for a visitor visa to come to Australia to visit their only grandchildren. The Australian embassy refused their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6077"> initial application because they are affected by a `risk factor' characteristic. A has sought advice in relation to having the decision reviewed. He was advised that he had a right of review at the Migration Internal Review Office and that the application fee is $500. He was further advised that his review application would be unlikely to be successful at MIRO as his parents are affected by a risk factor characteristic and that he had a further right of review to the Immigration Review Tribunal. The cost of application for review at the IRT is $850.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A could not justify spending $1,350 seeking a review of the decision to refuse his parents a visitor visa to Australia when there was no guarantee at the end of the review process that his parents would be granted visitor visas to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Case study No. 2 concerns B, a Somali who was granted refugee status in Australia during 1994. After he was granted refugee status, B re-established contact with C. B had known C from when he lived in Somalia and they are now engaged. B lodged an application to sponsor C to Australia under the prospective spouse category but this application was rejected by the Australian embassy. B sought a review of this decision at MIRO and has received a rejection. He has been advised that he has a further right of review at the IRT but with another application fee of $850. He cannot afford this fee and is unable to proceed with the IRT review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These case studies highlight the fact that the regulations contained in statutory rules 109 are yet again another example of DIMA using a blunt instrument to respond to claims of abuse in the system. I am aware that some of the agencies in the non-government sector worked long and hard to come up with proposals that they felt dealt with the nub of the issue, but unfortunately they were rejected by both the government and the ALP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is yet another sad day in the history of migration and refugee policy in this country. What you do is set the hurdles higher and higher. You reduce the resources more and more. You make it more and more difficult for people to access justice and have recourse. You make it more and more diffi

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in this debate on a motion by Senator Margetts to disallow certain migration regulations. As Senator Margetts has indicated already, the government has had discussions with Mr Duncan Kerr, who was the then opposition spokesperson in this area, and those discussions have led to an agreed outcome in many areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that it is not easy for quite a number of us on this side to agree to these regulations; nor do I imagine was it easy for Duncan Kerr to proceed down the path that he did with respect to discussions with the government. What we see through these regulations is a government committed to dismantling infrastructure which took quite some time to develop&mdash;infrastructure which was being recognised increasingly throughout the world as impressive; infrastructure which was giving people a fair say in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were confronted with a whole raft of rules and regulations which were unacceptable to us, and the opposition took the view that the best outcome we could achieve was to minimise the impact of such regulations by trying to enter into constructive negotiations. As a consequence of those negotiations, as I say, there has been an agreed outcome and we will not be supporting Senator Margetts's motions .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, we have developed in this country over a period of time a system which has been regarded as impressive not just internationally but also domestically. There are some problems with it&mdash;there always would be some problems with it. But at the end of the term of the previous government, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6078"> even the Refugee Council of Australia was placing on record its appreciation of the way the system had been developed both by the department and also by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The relationship that I had with those organisations, though rocky for a while, was one that by the end of my term in office was working quite well. Senator Harradine, I know that there have been problems all the way through and that the relationship was rocky. But we had, I think, developed a system whereby, through the RRT, people were being given a fair hearing, an unbiased hearing, and a hearing through which they could access information such as the state of country files, and whatever. It was a much more transparent process than before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says that the system, as it stood when it took office, was one that allowed manifestly unfounded claims for refugee status. People will always try to pursue a claim. But it is not up to governments to decide what is manifestly unfounded in respect of refugee status. We had a system in place to make that assessment, and that system is one which was developed only in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But our system has always allowed people to make claims because of the very nature of our constitutional system. Sometimes international agencies refer to the Australian system as having the magnetic effect of our democracy, of our rule of law, of people having the capacity to have their claims tested in a fair and unimpeded way. That I think is quite critical when it comes to the assessment of refugee status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We tried&mdash;although Senator Harradine would argue that from time to time we failed, and I accept that in respect of some cases his argument would have some validity&mdash;to stay out of the process and we tried not to prejudge it. We also tried in the context to increase the number of refugees that Australia would take&mdash;not just as refugees, but also people in humanitarian circumstances. As a consequence, under the previous government the numbers in this category kept on going up. Under this government, the numbers in these categories of humanitarian assistance 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> keep on going down&mdash;and this is at a time also, I must say, when world demand for assistance has not abated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only in recent weeks we have seen a situation in Cambodia which would have been ripe for a new special assistance category to assist those people in their time of conflict. Quite a number of people, we gather, sought protection, sought assistance from Australia. But the government's response was not to introduce a humanitarian category, an offshore SAC program&mdash;a program which would have been a ready response in the past. That is just one example of where we could have involved ourselves in international assistance&mdash;but we have not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Internationally and domestically, we have a government which is more isolationist, a government which is starting to close doors to refugees and humanitarian cases, and a government which at home is also trying to close avenues available to those people through which to seek assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that the government wants to do is extend the operation of prohibitive clauses. I had a chance to read the transcript of the Ervin case, the Black Panther case, the one that Minister Vanstone would know a lot about. A few telling points came out of that transcript.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One point was the total ineptness of the Commonwealth's representation before the High Court. The second was the fact that the High Court and Chief Justice made it very clear that, no matter what you do, you will not be able to stop people going to the High Court of Australia in search of their rights for procedural fairness and natural justice under administrative law. The third was that the High Court would prefer the government to set up alternative mechanisms in terms of court redress to handle those cases rather than have the High Court itself handle them. It also became quite apparent through that transcript that, if it had to, the High Court would handle those cases itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a message, I think, to the government when considering the merging of tribunals in the not too distant future: to take into account not just the constitutional imperatives but also the burden that they would be plac 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6079"> ing on the High Court. Unless the government hears the warning from the bench, Senator Vanstone may not be the last minister to be comprehensively bounced by the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts says, `Well you're supporting these regulations.' Senator Margetts, I say to you that we are being confronted by a pretty harsh agenda. In that context, the Labor Party chose to see whether it could get constructive outcomes to minimise the impact of a harsh and heavy-handed measure by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These were not measures that we introduced in government, nor would we have introduced them in government. But, confronted with them now, former shadow minister Duncan Kerr had, I think, an obligation to see how we could minimise their impact. I am informed that, in terms of those negotiations, there have been some six key changes proposed by the opposition which have been agreed to by the government. There is agreement to extend from 14 to 45 days the period in which an application for a protection visa can be made and the person can be eligible for work rights. An introduction of the original 14&hyphen;day period would have made it virtually impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In considering the specific issues of withdrawal of work rights after any cut&hyphen;off period, the government had been alerted by the opposition to circumstances which the government had given no consideration to in its original proposals, namely, the sur place claims; that is, claims in respect of a person who arrives in Australia with no intention or cause to seek asylum but for whom, whilst in Australia, circumstances in their home country change in a way that would cause them to legitimately seek Australian protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regulations in SR185 and SR97 do not articulate the way in which the government agreed to deal with the sur place claims. Our spokesman was of the view that it would probably be cumbersome to do so by way of regulations. However, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) has agreed to make a statement in parliament. For the record, the minister has agreed to deal with such claims as effectively as possible, as follows: for individuals, a guarantee of priority processing to be con 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tained in a section 499 ministerial direction; for groups, a gazette notice mechanism to enable the minister to remove them from the effect of the cut&hyphen;off; and for an applicant who does not meet the above, access to work rights to be granted if he or she holds a substantive visa at the time of making the protection visa application and the department has not made a primary decision on the application within six months. I understand the minister agrees that, to remove doubt and to not confine the commitment to the wording of the statement by the minister or the ideas I have outlined here, flexibility may be required and, if so, flexibility will be given to the spirit of the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were heaps of measures that we found objectionable. One was the $1,000 post&hyphen;decision fee for failed applicants to the RRT. Under the agreement it will remain, but our concerns have been met by the government agreeing to insert a two&hyphen;year sunset clause. The matter will also be referred within two years, along with other issues, for review by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say those concerns have been met but I must say they have been met only for the moment, because these issues are live issues and ones that we will monitor to ensure that the impact of them is minimised. From our perspective, that $1,000 post&hyphen;decision fee is an unconscionable measure but it is one that we have had to live with in the context of trying to get some limitation on the government's regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For these reasons, the opposition tried to seek a constructive outcome, an outcome which we think makes some important changes to the government's regulations. But I do say that we do not do ourselves any service as a nation when we embark upon this domestic bashing policy at home. We have developed a reputation internationally, and developed it over successive governments, as a protector of and assister to refugees and those who come under humanitarian circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the sorts of regulations that Malcolm Fraser would never have bowled up. These are the sorts of regulations the previous Liberal governments would not have bowled

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regulations before us put in place a new regime for people to work in Australia, the review periods for applications and the review application fee for both migrants and refugees. As we have already heard from Senator Margetts, the Australian Labor Party, the opposition, previously supported the disallowance motion for statutory rule No. 109; but that was before the former shadow minister, Mr Duncan Kerr, began acting as if he were the parliamentary secretary to the minister for immigration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason&mdash;we have been told&mdash;for this turnaround, this change, is to prevent abuse in the system. The Australian Democrats believe&mdash;as I would expect every party and person in this chamber to believe&mdash;that cheats and frauds should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. However, it is quite a different thing for the government to stigmatise and demonise migrants and refugees as cheats and frauds in the same way, we believe, they have attempted to do that with students and the unemployed. One can only wonder why the opposition would now buy into this political rhetoric when most community leaders and most politicians, we believe, are working hard to douse the hatred flames ignited by an Independent member in the other place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In classical terms this, yet again, is an attempt to crack a walnut with a sledgehammer. Of course, when that kind of approach is taken, ultimately a lot of other people get caught in the net&mdash;cracked as well, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> if you like. Certainly, Senator Margetts was able to illustrate a number of case studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are concerned that changes like these provide ammunition for the anti&hyphen;immigrant and anti&hyphen;refugee forces in this country. We are stereotyping all immigrants and refugees in this way. Senator Margetts also pointed out the paucity of documented cases of abuse. We have had no meaningful study as to the extent or nature of so&hyphen;called abuse, as was pointed out. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that there are presently 20 million refugees worldwide. Of those, Australia will accept 12,000. Of those, 2,000 designated as refugees will be people who are already here and 10,000 will be persons overseas in need of urgent resettlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can only begin to wonder&mdash;and the Democrats are very concerned about this&mdash;how these people will manage the new regime being introduced by the coalition and the opposition parties. The Democrats do not believe that bona fide persons should be priced out of the system. As I have said on previous occasions in this place, we do not believe in economically rationalised immigrants. Our policy makes it very clear that refugees should be given priority. The preference for looking after refugee and humanitarian cases is explicitly stated in Democrat policies; and I have made that very clear on a number of occasions in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that all people, despite their personal circumstances, should be assessed on their merits&mdash;their personal situation&mdash;not on whether or not they can pay their way into this country. If that had been the case in the years following the Second World War, we would have a very different society today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to draw to the attention of the chamber the provisions of section 48B of the Acts Interpretation Act, which stipulate that regulations are not to be remade while subject to a disallowance motion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter that we have before us is a motion by Senator Margetts for the disallowance of certain migration regulations as contained in statutory rules 1997 No. 109 and regulations as contained in statutory rules 1997 No. 185 and made under the Migration Act 1958.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am going to speak to No. 185 because, for all intents and purposes, that is what we are talking about, which is the result of the discussions that took place between the opposition and the government. I acknowledge that in some ways those discussions resulted in a lessening of some of the harshness of the regulations but I remain of the view that they will still have a substantial negative impact on bona fide asylum seekers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard what Senator Bolkus said and I know that there has been a change of forces midstream. Actually I do not know about it happening midstream, but I understand that Mr Martin Ferguson is now the shadow minister for immigration. I am just wondering what he thinks about the outcome, which we are seeking to disallow. I was interested to hear what Senator Bolkus said. As I heard him, he said, `When in government, we wouldn't have proposed these regulations.'</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. There is a nicer word. I do not think it was really an interjection; it was a supplementary contribution from Senator Margetts. Now that they are in opposition, I do not know why they would not oppose these amendments. Nevertheless, the discussions&mdash;no doubt with the minister; he is always open to discussion on matters&mdash;have resulted in a lessening of the harshness of the regulations that were previously put forward as statutory rules No. 109.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Statutory rules No. 185 go too far. Their punitive scope go beyond those making abusive claims for protection and they will affect innocent parties. My main concerns&mdash;I have a number of others; and I might just acknowledge what Senator Margetts has said as she has covered the field quite extensively&mdash;relate to access to work rights and the $1,000 fee. Whilst a 45-day period to apply for work rights is certainly preferable to a 14-day period, those who represent asylum seekers say that many of their clients are falling through the cracks and are without means of support because of this regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many asylum seekers are vulnerable. They have little English and do not know how to access the determination system. What are these asylum seekers to do if they are unable to prepare a protection visa application within 45 days of arrival? Do we want to be responsible for forcing them into destitution when they have been prohibited from supporting themselves? The problem with this regulation is that no safety nets come with it. As Senator Margetts mentioned, the UNHCR actually condemned similar measures when they were introduced into the UK.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I can just go to the $1,000 fee: there is no provision for waiving it in cases where an application is found not to be frivolous. I know of many people, especially Chinese asylum seekers fearing persecution on the basis of China's one&hyphen;child family policy, who failed at the RRT stage and were later given 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6082"> asylum when the courts found the RRT had erred in its ruling. My concern is that a person who fails at the review stage is, with this $1,000 fee, automatically equated to an abuser of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system is not perfect, as we know. Asylum seekers who genuinely fear persecution if returned to their homeland have failed to gain protection on our shores. To me, that is refoulement and, to me, we have an obligation not to refoule. That these people were unsuccessful does not at all mean that they were wanting to rort the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, other ways of targeting alleged abuses without affecting bone fide asylum seekers were not considered by the government or, alternatively, rejected by the government. Bona fide asylum seekers will be deterred from accessing review procedures. How are they to pay the fee if they are unsuccessful? I understand what Senator Bolkus just said about the two years and about the reference of certain matters to the joint committee. I do not know what the result of that will be, but bona fide asylum seekers will be deterred from accessing the review procedures. How are they to pay the fee if they are unsuccessful? I will come back to that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Targeting those who are least able to pay it seems a strange method of cost recovery. Perhaps it is being cynical to suggest that perhaps the intention of the fee is that the unsuccessful applicant will be unable to pay it, will therefore incur a debt to the Commonwealth and will therefore never be able to come back and apply again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to see evidence of the alleged abuses that are taking place. Why is the only report on this not being released when it was a result of what was originally described by the minister as a public review? I would like the minister to respond to that in her summing up. I will be supporting the motion that has been put forward by Senator Margetts and supported by Senator Stott Despoja.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I first came in during this debate, Senator Bolkus had already commenced his contribution, and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I listened with interest to the remainder of it. In essence, he basically said those opposite do not like this and they do not want to do it but they are going to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had occasion to have a quick look at a release put out by Duncan Kerr, the shadow minister for population issues and immigration, on 25 June this year. It is quite a contrast to what we hear from Senator Bolkus, who tonight spoke on behalf of the former government, the opposition, and to what they said at the time. A couple of quotes might be illuminating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the Government and the Opposition accept that in recent times the refugee stream has been corrupted by some manifestly unfounded claims for refugee status. If this continued, confidence in the system would have been eroded.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is a clear admission from the opposition that something had to be done&mdash;and something reasonably drastic. I will come to some figures on that in a minute. The press release went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a need to toughen up the system . . . That is why the Opposition had sought a workable response which could be supported by both parties.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He even praises one aspect and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An innovative change is that, for people who apply outside the 45 day period, their work rights will be restored after six months if their application has not yet been determined by the Department.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a piece of praise from the opposition for these regulations which I did not hear from Senator Bolkus when I listened to his contribution. Mr Kerr goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes will hit those who seek to abuse a system designed to protect the most vulnerable whilst minimising the impact on genuine claimants.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Harradine is right: when you toughen up a system&mdash;it could be any system&mdash;there is the likelihood that you will make it harder for some of the genuine people. That is the real crime committed by people who misuse and abuse a system to the point that it has to be tightened up. Sadly, often the people for whom the system is designed are disadvantaged, and it is because of the people who misuse it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said I would give some indication of why Duncan Kerr had said there was a need to toughen up the system and that the refugee 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6083"> stream had `been corrupted by some manifestly unfounded claims'. I would like to quote briefly from Mr Ruddock's response to a question in the other place in June. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, this year we expect to receive some 10,000 applications for refugee status in Australia, and possibly more. That is 20 times more than we saw only seven years ago. The cost of assessing all of those claims through the various stages with the judicial intervention, asylum seeker support and the like is over $60 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A large number of the applications are not coming from residents of countries that are generally associated with human rights abuses. Numbers have come from the Philippines, Tonga, Fiji and Thailand. This financial year, the department has finalised more than 3,000 applications from those countries that I have mentioned and has been able to identify only four bona fide refugees.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That bears repeating&mdash;of the 3,000 applications finalised this financial year only four were identified as bona fide refugees. Minister Ruddock went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">People are turning up at my department and asking for a $30 work visa, the name by which we understand the protection visa is now becoming known. By lodging an application, such individuals can obtain work rights in Australia and they know that they cannot be sent home until after their refugee application has been properly assessed and considered by the department, possibly the Refugee Review Tribunal, accessing my discretion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the minister's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and applications to the courts. We also know that, in many cases, what they are seeking is access to Medicare, benefits for which they have in no way paid or contributed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is just a brief excerpt from statements Mr Ruddock made recently. I think it strengthens the case argued by Duncan Kerr, the shadow minister for immigration and multicultural affairs, in relation to these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to Senator Stott Despoja's contribution, I am constantly left almost speechless by the Australian Democrats' contributions on these matters. As you may know, Madam Acting Deputy President Patterson, the Democrats apparently have a zero net migration policy and yet consistently seek to frustrate the government's agenda. Last year, for example, we were seeking to get through the parliament some changes in regulations that would have slightly reduced 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and changed the composition of migrant intake. Despite the fact that the Democrats have a zero net migration policy, they nonetheless refused to accept any of those changes. It is sort of, `We want the world to be black, but we want it to be white as well and we do not have to explain why the two never meet.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 45-day cut-off period for work rights is perhaps worth mentioning. There has been a suggestion that these will force people to make hasty and poorly prepared applications. The government does not accept that that is the case. I think Senator Harradine might have been the one to raise this matter. All a person has to do is lodge an initial application and their claims are going to be assessed thoroughly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of these matters is worth highlighting. I did understand someone to say that we do not want these things to be dealt with in an economically rationalist way as if to say that is all that is behind these changes. But, equally, we are accountable to taxpayers for how we use their funds. To simply say that we want to exercise care in the spending of money does not mean that you are necessarily pursuing any particular ideological bent; you are simply doing what everyone in this place ought to be doing&mdash;that is, exercising care in the expenditure of taxpayers' funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give an example of non-refugee cases. The review fees are refundable if you win. I understand Senator Margetts raised this point and said that she knew people who did not want to pay because they could not be guaranteed that they would win. That is the nature of a review, Senator. It is an independent assessment, and there is no guarantee. If they could be guaranteed that they would win, it would be a case of purchasing a decision. I do not really think, Senator, that you want to be on record as supporting a system where people are permitted to purchase a decision.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be delighted to. I only wish other people would do the same. Then it would not be so enticing for people to respond to them. What Senator Margetts did say was, in effect, that people do not want to pay because they do not get any guarantee that they are going to win their appeal. It follows that if what you are saying is that they would pay if they could be guaranteed that they would win their appeal, then you are, in a sense, saying that if you sold these thing it would be okay. That is what a guaranteed outcome is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any event, the review fees are refundable if you win. The unit cost of an Immigration Review Tribunal matter is somewhere around $3,200&mdash;$850 is about 25 per cent of that. The rest of it is paid by Australian taxpayers who expect a system to be a workable, sensible system&mdash;not a half-hearted system and definitely not one where there are 3,000 applicants in one year only four of which are considered to be bona fide. They do not expect that. For refugee cases, the review is free. But it is true that $1,000 is payable if you lose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn briefly to the matters raised by Senator Stott Despoja. She had some concerns that the regulations put in place as a result of the agreement between the government and the opposition on these matters may be in breach of section 48B of the Acts Interpretation Act and thus invalid. I understand her concern is that the amending regulations may be the same in substance as the regulations that are subject to her disallowance motion. I can confirm that advice has been received from the Attorney-General's Department that the amending regulations are in fact valid. I understand that the Senate has been given a copy of that advice, as have the opposition, Senator Margetts and Senator Harradine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, the legal advice is that the regulations do not infringe the Acts Interpretation Act and are therefore valid. This is because they are not the same in substance as the regulations subject to Senator Margetts's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> motion, as the legal advice points out at paragraph 6, and they are indeed substantially different. If the Senate wants, I would be happy to table those. But I understand senators have them.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators would be aware, in statutory rules No. 109, the government put in place a series of measures which seek to reduce the number of unmeritorious claims for refugee status. While the government has a non-negotiable commitment to ensuring that people seeking refugee status have their claims properly and responsibly considered, it is most concerned that the process is being abused by certain applicants `buying time' in Australia when they are not entitled to refugee status.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addressing these concerns, the government introduced a number of measures contained in statutory rules No. 109 which are aimed at deterring unmeritorious applicants from lodging claims for refugee status. For example, the amendments reduce the time period within which applications for review by the Refugee Review Tribunal must be lodged. They introduce a $1,000 post&hyphen;decision fee for unsuccessful refugee review tribunal applicants and limit access to work rights for protection visa applicants where they have not lodged their application within 14 days of being in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Statutory rules No. 109 also contains measures aimed at addressing other abuses within the system by reducing the time period within which applications for internal review or for review by the IRT must be lodged; by removing certain refund provisions in relation to internal review and review by the IRT; and by including in special assistance category visas the requirement that, before being granted the visa, the minister must be satisfied that the applicant is not eligible for a permanent visa of any other class.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the making of statutory rule No. 109, the government met with the opposition 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6085"> to discuss those sorts of measures. I am advised that those meetings resulted in an agreement to work constructively towards reducing the number of unmeritorious claims by making some further amendments as follows. The application period for review of refugee decisions is to remain at 28 days and the period for internal review and review by the IRT is to be set at 21 days. The existing provisions for refund of review fees of successful applicants for migration internal and external review are to continue. However, the external review fee would be increased to $850 to ensure there was no effect on the budget. A further amendment will introduce a two&hyphen;year sunset clause to the regulation requiring a $1,000 post&hyphen;decision fee for unsuccessful review applicants. In the meantime, we will be asking the Joint Standing Committee on Migration to review the issues in 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another amendment is to replace the 14&hyphen;day period in which a protection visa application must be made in order to attract work rights with a 45&hyphen;day period. For people with sur place refugee claims, there will be regulations enabling the minister to remove specified groups of people from the effect of the work rights cut&hyphen;off as necessary. Individual sur place refugee claimants affected by lack of work rights will have the effect minimised by priority processing. We expect to make provision for this in a ministerial direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For people who have substantive visas at the time of making protection visa applications, we will allow access to work rights if the department has not made a primary decision on the application after six months of the application being lodged. In other words, there have been some constructive negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer briefly to the press release of Duncan Kerr, who is the shadow spokesperson. On 25 June he clearly thought that something needed to be done. That is why he said that the opposition accepts that in recent times the refugee stream has been corrupted by some manifestly unfounded claims for refugee status. He went on to say that, if it continued, confidence in the system would have been eroded.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) and the opposition spokesman have remained in touch on these issues and have agreed that it is essential that the measures which have been put in place to address the abuse in the onshore refugee determination process and review systems proceed unhindered. Therefore, we are very grateful that the opposition has indicated that it will support the government in opposing these disallowance motions.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we have seen one of the nastier aspects of scapegoat politics in Australia. We have seen the ongoing politics of blame. That is, you find the people who are least able to fight back, who have the least power in our society&mdash;in the world, in fact&mdash;and you blame them for those things that are going wrong in your country. The blame is delivered in an around about way, but the scapegoat politics say that, if things are not going right in your own country, you find a way of taking people's minds off those things and find them to blame. So you blame Aboriginal people, the unemployed, the young and refugees. It works very well. Here it is working well again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has never been the case that there are no other options available. If there are people who are using refugee applications for work solely, there have been constructive suggestions made&mdash;and this was not mentioned by the minister&mdash;by non-government organisations, and the government has refused to consider them. They are not interested in dealing with solving or directing against perceived problems. As I mentioned in my main contribution, they are not actually interested in targeting those people who are actually breaking the law&mdash;that is, those people who are giving that advice and profiting from giving advice who may be sponsoring people who are wanting to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the countries that the minister mentioned, one was Thailand. It springs to mind that there are a number of people in Thailand whom I have heard of in border camps who may well not get their applications approved in Australia because they slip in between those cracks. They may well have a situation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6086"> where they have not been able to get other individual people to sign documents which prove that they were tortured. About two weeks ago I heard from a person who has come from Burma a month ago who gave a vivid, heart-rending description of systematic torture within Burma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It could well be that people in camps in Thailand could be classified as not being able to prove their origins, as not being able to prove that they have been systematically tortured. They may well fall amongst those 3,000. It may well be that there are changes in government policies which mean that only four are judged to be bona fide for various other reasons. But it may also be that Australia is closing its eyes to some instances in the Philippines, for example, where there are constant and daily dangers to people's lives. There are parts of the Philippines where living and staying in those areas will mean constant and daily dangers to their lives and their futures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting: only four refugees were judged to be bona fide. There were 3,000 applications and only four were judged to be bona fide. You have to wonder just how many people from those countries also slipped between the cracks. It is not a case where the government can say, `Simply those abusing the system are responsible.' In relation to those people who are murdered, who are raped, who are in gaol for the rest of their lives because of this measure, you and the Labor Party cannot sit and say, `Those people who are responsible are those people who may be from Tonga, or maybe some other applications are being given the advice to apply in a certain way.' You cannot say that you are not responsible for their deaths and tortures and rapes. You cannot sit here and say that you are innocent of what will happen to those people because they somehow slipped between the cracks in the system and have not been able to jump your hurdles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How dare you say that somehow or other not supporting this disallowance motion means that people in this system indicate that they support rorting the system. There are ways of dealing with that. You have not even talked to those groups who are suggesting 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ways that they can be dealt with. You want to blame those people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some comments about the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R104">Productivity Commission Bill 1996</XREF> . Australian industry is demanding a commitment from this government. What we need is an economic advisory body that advocates pro&hyphen;active, clear and distinctive industry policy  that is aimed at providing Australia with a sustainable industry program. What we do not need is a monolithic, myopic institution that has at its heart the driest form of economic rationalism. Because of the Productivity Commission's adherence to this economic theory, it ignores the complex reality of Australian economic life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the chamber are only too aware that economic rationalism does not prescribe for a government industry policy. This paradigm does not advocate for industry help. What the Productivity Commission will advocate because of its adherence to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> economic rationalist paradigm is an absence of what this government calls `market distortions' created by what this government refers to as `an interfering government', and that the market forces drive prosperity and that minimal government is advantageous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission will argue that Australian business should not compete with other countries in businesses that they are successful in. For example, the Productivity Commission says there is no point competing with the IT&amp;T industries in Ireland and there is no point competing with the IT&amp;T industries in Israel because they are successful at it. The comparative advantage of nations comes into the equation. The Productivity Commission will prescribe an Australian economic efficiency market fuelled by self&hyphen;interested individuals; therefore the Productivity Commission will argue that the market determines industrial outcomes and will allocate resources premised on purely market forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears that the Productivity Commission has a slogan: `Get the economics fundamentals right and she'll be right'. It is not just the Productivity Commission that argues this; this is the fundamental premise on which this government operates. By the very presence of this set of bills before the chamber there is no denying that the coalition government wishes to institute a body that will be a tenacious adherent to one economic theory, and that is economic rationalism. In its driest form this economic theory does not prescribe policy directions for social justice or social welfare; this theory assumes that poverty would be overcome if an efficient market were allowed to reign supreme. It is what used to be known as the old trickle down theory, although there are probably less edifying terms for it which I will not go into here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, this theory's proponents argue that unemployment is a voluntary action because of the refusal to allow minimum wages to be set. There is no reason to believe that the Productivity Commission is going to act any differently. By implementing this set of bills as they are it will be the catalyst and the harbinger of the collapse of an alternative competing economic advice bureau, which I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6089"> understand Senator Sherry has already referred to. With the passage of these bills all competing advice will have been legislated out of existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Productivity Commission (Repeals, Transitional and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996  will be the implementing tool by which this government will filter out all dissenting comment, and economic advice will be through one portfolio: Treasury, who will reign supreme in the field of economic policy. It is not just us who are uncomfortable about the notion of Treasury having what seems to be a fairly omnipotent power in relation to economic theory. I would be very surprised if there were not members on the other side who had concerns in relation to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission set of bills before this chamber is signalling the death knell of rational and balanced economic advice. The implementation of these two bills will see the institutionalisation of the Productivity Commission's power as the dominant economic advice bureau. It will see the institutionalisation of the driest form of economic rationalism. It will be the institutionalisation of a government body's view of Australian society in the narrowest of economic terms. The implementation of this set of bills will institute a government body that divorces social equity and wealth redistribution from government policy. They will not be factored into the equation. The Productivity Commission does not consider those aspects of Australian life as important in terms of its economic modelling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Professor Quiggin comments in his submission to the Economics Committee on the Productivity Commission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The dominance of the Productivity Commission creates a danger that erroneous and even incoherent assumptions may be applied consistently.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Implicit in the setting up of this commission is the abolition of two alternative economic advice bureaus: the Bureau of Industry Economics and the Economic Planning and Advisory Commission. EPAC, with its origin in the 1983 economic summit, was an important body. It was important because it provided an alternative public advice bureau. It was an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> avenue that public bodies, non&hyphen;government organisations and the general public could access to discuss different economic policy views. This was a critical forum for providing not only alternative views but also economic education. From the number of economic policies that it discussed and passed advice on, EPAC showed that it has the capacity to interact with the community and stakeholders in an open and genuine way. Unfortunately it could be argued that EPAC is just another institution that is paying the price for being created during the Labor government. Once again the coalition is dismantling a forum, in my view, because of ideological spite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The BIE, because of its position within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and its attachment to the industry, science and tourism portfolio, provides another avenue to seek alternative economic advice. This body conducted examinations on a plethora of industry issues, playing an important part in distinguishing Australia's industry and economic framework. Under this set of bills, BIE and EPAC will cease to exist. They will be exterminated because of ignorance and blind arrogance in relation to having one conduit for economic advice and the supremacy of Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor we promoted the competitive advice model, where economic advice was gathered from a number of sources. It was a significant way to ensure that economic policy differentials were canvassed and a variety of competing views judged on their merits. With this set of bills we have a body that argues from a narrow and blinkered economic viewpoint to its own and to Australian industry's detriment. Because of its inherent nature the Productivity Commission will push for economic efficiency that discounts any social and environmental consequences of economically efficient markets where resources have been allocated efficiently. The Productivity Commission is not in the business of taking into account social factors or environmental factors. They are not even considered in relation to this. Therefore Australian society will be defined by the Productivity Commission in the narrowest terms: productivity and allocative efficiency.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6090">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would remind the chamber of a number of recommendations that have emanated from this commission, most of which are encapsulated in this wonderful document called `Microsteps to Economic Reform', which I understand Senator Sherry referred to earlier. I might add that it was written by a commission that does not even legally exist yet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report clearly states the commission's claim to be arbiter in education, health, community services, taxation, environment, industry policy and federal relations. It believes that it can achieve an efficient, well ordered society by attaching a price to every individual activity of judges, nurses, teachers, RAAF pilots, park rangers and so on. For example, for law and order the Productivity Commission suggests scrapping the police force and hiring private security guards and detective agencies. Ridiculous!</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the RAAF, the Productivity Commission recommends that the services should be contracted out to some no frills airlines for the supply of air defence, air strike, long range maritime surveillance, close battle field ground support and troop transport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Productivity Commission follows the maxim that every and any thing that government provides should be contestable. It presupposes that people are educated enough to understand the choices that they have in front of them, that Productivity Commission bills they will gather information to help them to make a informed choice. However, given the recommendations the Productivity Commission made in their submission to the west review on education, its highly unlikely that people will be able to afford the education in order to make a informed decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's interesting to note that despite the commission advocating the contracting out of government services, it doesn't suggest its own economic advice be contracted out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government believes in contracting out all of its services however, Mr Howard doesn't look at 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> contracting out economic advice, instead he creates this monolith.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Productivity Commission will be a flawed institution, if only for its support of suspect quantitative methodology. Now you don't have to be an economist with a special inner glow for econometrics to see that the Orani and the Monash models are flawed in their assumptions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commission used the Orani model to arrive at their assumptions in their micro economic report. The inputs used were premised on time periods that were so short that no fixed asset could be introduced into, or removed from, any production process, so short that no exchange rate could vary, so short that no household could begin to spend any increase in income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However there was a wonderful paradox that for some aspects the time period was so long that all prices adjust fully to a change in wages which adjust fully to prices which adjust fully to wages ad infinitum. What a surprise!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fundamental flaw in the Orani model is the assumption of full employment. Now we all know that there isn't full employment, yet Costello and Howard seem to have suffered amnesia, or is it rather a case of wishful thinking? How can we implement a economic advice bureaus recommendations that are premised on suspected parameters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this commission was not going to have such an impact upon Australian society, the institution would be farcical.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A derivative of the Orani model, the Monash model, used to justify the cut in car tariffs, is just as suspect. This model again has reasonably simplistic views. The Monash model believes that the gains estimate will vastly exceed an approximate upper estimate of the gain provided by a simple rule of thumb based on imports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we have before us is a commission that uses suspect econometrics which have been savaged by economists, business and academics. And because of this set of bills, the Productivity Commission will be unchallenged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This set of bills will create as the unions argue a entrenchment of power of the Productivity Commission as the epitome of dominance of economic fundamentalism in government decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conjunction with this is the concern I have over the virtual monopolisation of economic policy advice under the treasury portfolio which will adversely effect Australian industry. This will only mean that more people will being losing their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the 29 July 1996 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  article said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">in the name of reform, Peter Costello is engineering a big reduction in the amount, diversity 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6091"> and breath of view of economic research done by federal agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inherent within this monopolisation of research and economic information, is the removal of key institutions from the portfolio of prime minister and cabinet to the auspices and the control of treasury. It has been argued quite succinctly in the press that the manipulation of the Productivity Commission by treasury is the culmination of its efforts to restore the monopoly over pretty much all of the economic advice that it had lost to prime minister and cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By putting the Productivity Commission under Mr Costello's effective control the commission will act as a intellectual filter. That's it pure and simple. The Productivity Commission will act as a sponge for economic rationalist policies and a barrier to competing and dissenting economic views.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This control over economic advice will signify the death knell for industry policy. For as we already know and are aware Mr Costello is not an strong patron of industry policy&mdash;or as he defines it "business welfare".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This attitude is inherent within the department of treasury. The treasury's intellectual horizon is limited, it does not have the academic ability to analyse regional differences or look at the economy in terms of industry. This will be further exacerbated with the introduction of the Productivity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The clearest example of this are the comments made by Mr Staples, from the Industry Commission. Mr staples slammed the Mortimer Report saying that there was a lack of depth in its analysis and that he had grave concerns about the "call for a one billion dollar fund to attract investment."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I suppose it shouldn't have been too much a surprise, however the Mortimer report is one of three reports damning the government's lack of industry policy. The MTIA report even went as far as saying that there was now a political imperative to get industry policy under way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The absence of any sign that qualitative research is used in treasury analysis raises the question about the fundamental nature of this department. What does it take for treasury to realise that there are people attached to quantitative research? Or is the treasury and Costello not overly concerned that for example, one hundred thousand TCF workers could join that "work for the dole" queue with no hope of ever getting off. Or is the government looking for more participants for its work for the dole scheme? One hundred thousand workers could lose their jobs all because the treasury, Costello and Productivity Commission don't want to be seen as dealing out "industry welfare".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How many examples does this government need to show them that major sections of the manufacturing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sector are leaving? In the last month we have had Gloweave, Berlei, Clark's, Dupont's and in my own state Blundstone's leaving or threatening to leave.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last Thursday the senate supported an alp motion to freeze tariffs until 2005. It will remain to be seen whether the government will respect the Senate's wishes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This coalition government is abandoning our industry, whilst the Productivity Commission sits back and argues that we don't pay enough attention to agriculture and mining sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm not inferring that we should forget those sectors, however there is an urgent need for the manufacturing sector and industry as a whole to receive more than tacit support and lip service. We cannot afford to keep losing our industry assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The TCF tariff issue is one case in point. The Productivity Commission, otherwise known as the industry commission, recommendations are to cut TCF tariffs from up to thirty seven percent to five percent by the year 2008.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Productivity Commission implements its TCF report's recommendations then we are in immediate danger of losing and selling off our talent to our overseas competitors. We are exporting our jobs, our skilled labour and our talent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A reduction in TCF tariffs will effect three thousand companies and one hundred thousand full time jobs. Regional areas, such as Tasmania and the nation as a whole cannot sustain this loss. One hundred thousand people who are directly employed will be thrown on the scrap heap. And that figure doesn't even account for those people who are reliant on TCF industries for their business such as the small corner shop, retail shops, supermarkets&mdash;basically every business that TCF workers patronise will lose if the Productivity Commission's recommendations are taken up.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TCF industries are represented in every state, they play a significant and crucial role in state economies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania is one such state that cannot afford to lose industries. The Tasmanian economy is not just standing on the brink of the economic abyss it is in it.

The new Productivity Commission then gets all of the reporting powers of the old Industry Commission plus a couple of massive new powers, like its own proactive research and the power to receive and investigate so&hyphen;called competitive neutrality complaints.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am on the record for years here as being an ardent critic of the old Industry Commission, and the Democrats do not think Australia needs a productivity commission either. Indeed, I think the tide in Australia is turning 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6093"> and that the barren, heartless, soulless and ultimately gainless ideology of the Industry Commission, trading as the Productivity Commission, is now out of step with the needs of the nation. This is evidenced by the enormously popular decision by the government, supported and let us say urged on by the Democrats and Labor, to reject the commission's recommendations on motor vehicle tariffs, and the near unanimity that any call from the commission to cut TCF tariffs should also be rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats think that the $25 million the government intends to spend this year propping up the ideological outpouring of the Productivity Commission would be far better spent commissioning independent expert reports from Australian and international experts on how best to position Australia for the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very best part of these two bills, the part that the Democrats will wholeheartedly support, is the schedule abolishing the Industry Commission. The Industry Commission and its predecessor, the Industries Assistance Commission&mdash;which was a euphemistic title, I think, considering it was really the industries abolition commission&mdash;have done untold damage to the Australian economy, particularly to our manufacturing sector, over the past two decades. I give notice that I will be seeking to have the second reading motion divided to allow us to vote against the Productivity Commission bill but in favour of the consequential amendments bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am afraid history will record that the Industry Commission was the creation of the Labor government and that its ideological zealotry underpinned Labor's industry and tariff policies of the last decade. I cannot understand Labor's continuing support for this dressed&hyphen;up Industry Commission with a powerful, expanded mandate. I cannot understand that they do not recognise that it has the same potential for job shedding, tax cutting, flat earth ideology as the old Industry Commission dished up to a generation of Labor ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, the ACTU, in its submission to the Senate committee on this bill, urged that the bill be opposed. We agree with the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ACTU that the commission would pick up the worst prejudices and practices of the Industry Commission but in a way that is less open and accountable. The ACTU concluded in its submission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is nothing to indicate that the commission would have the capacity or the will to recognise the interests of industries, consumers and the community, the social and environmental consequences of measures proposed by the commission, which it would be required to have regard to under the general policy guidelines in section 8 of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Labor proposes amendments, but in their amendments what we see is a further amendment of these policy guidelines; guidelines which we know the zealots of the commission will twist to their own purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Labor fails to support us in opposing this bill, we will be proposing very strict guidelines, particularly on what must and must not be included in the reports of the commission. We think this approach is far tighter than the wimpy nature of the Labor amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time and time again the old Industry Commission, at the bidding of the Labor government which created it, could be relied on to call for cuts in tariffs, cuts in public spending, cuts in all forms of regulation, cuts in wages&mdash;irrespective of the impact of these on unemployment or on communities or society generally. You could rely on the good old Industry Commission to crank up the old ORANI model to spew out great predictions of how much better off the country would be if only the government and its nasty taxes would disappear and the market were allowed to run unfettered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But of course the Industry Commission goes missing in action when time and time again its forecasts of an economic nirvana fail to arrive. Each time the commission has an answer to this. When we say, `Where is the nirvana? Where is the paradise? We have had 14 years now: where is the evidence?', what does the commission do? It simply moves the goalposts further to the right across the wasteland of the level playing field and says, `Oh, it has not worked yet because even more reform is required to get it going.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission's greatest failure, I think, was that it always had a blind spot for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6094"> the casualties of its recommendations. Former Democrat senator Sid Spindler was one of those who constantly kept track of the impact of the Industry Commission's policy failures. The 1993 report of his independent parliamentary inquiry into tariffs and industry development evidenced widespread job losses caused by tariff cuts closing down large chunks of Australian industry. The report found that tariff cuts as advocated by the Industry Commission had cost hundreds of thousands of jobs, but that the so&hyphen;called benefit of lower prices&mdash;which was meant to be the big trade&hyphen;off&mdash;had not eventuated. The proportion of manufactured goods sold in Australia and also made in Australia fell from around 65 per cent to less than 50 per cent during the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In more recent years, the Industry Commission was encouraged by the former government to move outside its original role of destroying the Australian manufacturing sector. It was asked to destroy the public sector as well. This is what that wonderful big bang reform called `competition policy' was all about. In 1995, the Industry Commission, enormously enthused about the then Prime Minister's plan to force the public sector to compete, was asked to produce a report on the benefits of competition policy. The report promised a $23 billion bonanza and a five per cent rise in national GDP if only the public sector was forced to be more like the private sector. It sounds like the Demtel man, doesn't it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor John Quiggin, an ANU macroeconomist, sat down and carefully analysed this report. He found it was riddled with double&hyphen;counting errors; broad, brash generalisations of benefits; and complete omissions of transitional and adjustment costs. In short, it was just plain faulty, and seriously so. Correcting the report for all its errors, this big promised benefit was frittered down from $23 billion to just $1 billion to $2 billion. That is a huge difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last few years have not been good years for the Industry Commission and its much criticised ORANI model. Last year it produced its highly controversial report on the car industry, predicting a national economic 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> gain of $1&half; billion from zero car tariffs. After criticism from the private sector, this figure was revised down to just $75 million with just a six per cent fall in industry employment. Chris Murphy, from Econtech, one of the modellers who identified the flaws in the commission's original model, said, `You are still wrong.' He forecast that 24 per cent of jobs in the industry would go, and that is 10,000 in South Australia alone compared with the 1,000 estimated by the commission. So we have $23 billion to $1 billion to $2 billion and 10,000 jobs to 1,000 jobs, and we are staking the whole future of policy development on this faulty reckoning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Brian Toohey, in his excellent book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tumbling Dice: the story of modern economic policy</EMPHASIS>, provides a whole chapter on the continued failure of the ORANI model and the damage caused by the commission's reliance on it. Too often commission reports based on ORANI have been accepted on face value by successive governments who want to believe that the sword of ideology of economic rationalism preached by the Industry Commission would work. They did&mdash;they fervently wanted to believe that. That was their world view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent years I should acknowledge that, with its broader policy role, the commission has been developing what I suppose purists would call deviant or, at best, revisionist tendencies because the commission has occasionally produced reports that were based on unbiased assessments of the usually overwhelming evidence free from the usual ideological hang&hyphen;ups. But, of course, these reports were not the ones that were welcomed by the government because they did not have the ideological set&hyphen;up that was to prepare us for the next move in the government's policy agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have to cite the commission's report on public housing, its report on research and development and its recent report on the private health industry as three clear exceptions to the prevailing rule because these are reports that made recommendations on a positive role for government in these industries and these are recommendations that this government has chosen to completely ignore. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6095"> I suppose the new Productivity Commission will stop deviating from the rigid ideological framework that is set up in the future because these messages are clearly not the messages that its masters now want to hear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats think the bill before us is dangerous in expanding the role of an ideologically driven organisation that has already been shown to rely on faulty theory, faulty modelling and a faulty view of the real world. I am particularly disturbed by provisions in the bill that would make such an organisation the impartial investigator of competitive neutrality disputes. For a start, the Democrats do not support the nature of competitive neutrality disputes. Does the public sector have a massive competitive advantage over the private sector? Doesn't the private sector have a massive competitive advantage over the public sector because the private sector is not required to be publicly accountable through the parliament for its activities because it is not expected to provide comprehensive service to all those who need it, as is the basis of public service?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, I do not believe that we need a body to hear complaints about competitive neutrality and, even if we did, the one&hyphen;eyed ideologues at the Productivity Commission would be exactly the wrong people to hear such complaints. Imagine a public sector agency trying to persuade such right&hyphen;wing ideologues of the importance of universal service obligations. Senator Campbell is frowning. He has not been paying attention to the good old Industry Commission and its history; I have. I think it is fair to call them right&hyphen;wing ideologues. Imagine trying to persuade them of the importance of universal service obligations or the importance of accountability, democracy or social responsibility because these are not variables in the ORANI model of the Australian economy. Therefore, they are not regarded as important in the Industry Commission's view of the world. So it is fatally flawed from the beginning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats will be voting against this bill at both the second and third reading stages. We think the Industry Commission has done enough damage to the Australian econ 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> omy and its institutions. We think that to propose expanding its role, renaming it, giving it new powers and telling it to do more is simply inviting more social and economic dislocation. If, however, the bill does proceed to the committee stage, we will be moving a number of amendments that seek to modify the operating guidelines of the commission to take into account matters that are essential to the development of industry&mdash;matters such as ecological sustainability and social sustainability. We want to require the commission to give more consideration to the employment, social and community impacts of its recommendations. We want to require it by law to provide alternatives rather than a single dogmatic position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To continue in the guise of broadening the considerations to match the commission's broader role, the Democrats will also be moving amendments to require at least one of the commissioners to be experienced in the principles of ecological sustainability, and at least one to be experienced in social welfare services. We think that this would help balance the dry economics of the commission's dominant paradigm. But, most of all, the Democrats would prefer to see this bill defeated. We hope the Labor Party will join us in killing the Productivity Commission and the Industry Commission. This would be a welcome break with Labor's past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I will be seeking to have the motion for the second reading of these bills divided, as we do wish to proceed to deal with the  Productivity Commission (Repeals, Transitional and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996 . The Democrats will be moving amendments to transfer the staff and the work of the Industry Commission to Treasury, where I am sure they will feel quite comfortable and at home ideologically. It would be a soft landing for them, so to speak&mdash;a soft landing that successive generations of Industry Commission staff have failed to provide for the hundreds of thousands of workers retrenched in the name of the Industry Commission as a result of their recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats urge the Senate to oppose the Productivity Commission Bill, to support the abolition of the Industry Commission as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6096"> one definitive step we can take to lay to rest the demons of economic rationalism.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Productivity Commission is an organisation designed simply to provide yet another powerful taxpayer funded voice for an extremely limited economic ideology which has been promoted in Treasury and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for far too long. This ideology is so prevalent because economic fundamentalists have been in place in the top positions of virtually every federal department for some period and they have been extremely active in setting&mdash;and selling&mdash;policy for both major parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the term `economic fundamentalist' or `fundy' I refer to those who adhere to a very simplistic, idealised and naive notion of the operation of economic markets, with no reference to the reality of the impact of their policies whatever. An example I have given recently was the Wallis report, which was supposed to look at the impacts of deregulation within financial markets in Australia. If it had done that maybe we would have had a different report. But it did not do that at all. It said, `We are not going to look into that.' I do not  know why but in fact it turned around and recommended more of the same. So, without actually looking at the impact of what had been done, it turned around and said, `Let's look at more of the same.' That is an example of economic fundamentalism that is operating in Australia at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission looks set to be a more rabid and nasty version of the Industry Commission. The Industry Commission, as an example of the work of economic fundies, was notable for its heavy ideological position. My problem with the old Industry Commission and the proposed Productivity Commission is that they are in effect an embodiment of faith in a particular version of the so&hyphen;called `international free market'. They are quasi&hyphen;religious organisations which emulate rationality but do not relate to it. They hold inquiries into the economic market, and their reports are nearly always simple reiterations of their faith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I describe the Industry Commission as rabid and nasty is the nature of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> outcomes of their faith. Their reports, as I said, always start with the same assumptions and deliver the same conclusions. Their conclusions are that government should deregulate, tariffs and concessions should drop, costs should be put on a user&hyphen;pays basis and labour costs should be reduced. It is a mantra. The Industry Commission's conclusions are the same even when all the evidence shows that allowing the private sector to operate in place of government and other services results in a cartel&hyphen;like behaviour causing massive distortion of prices, penalties for consumers, including business consumers, and extremely bad outcomes for small business, workers and rural people, and so on. The conclusions are always: remove regulation, allow market freedom, shed workers, reduce wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was what the Industry Commission concluded in its report No. 40 of 1994 on the petrol industry. In the face of massive evidence, from its own inquiry, of serious market distortion and manipulation by an oligopolistic petroleum cartel, the Industry Commission decided that what was needed was more freedom for a handful of immensely powerful corporations to manipulate their franchise agents who are small business people. It never did explain how that was supposed to solve the problems. I suppose its Orani model, to which Senator Kernot has referred, said that Royal Dutch, Shell, British Petroleum and others would reinvest their expropriated profits&mdash;blithely assuming the investment would be in Australia&mdash;and that this would be extremely efficient and create a massive increase in jobs and mining exports. Ho hum. That is usually what the Industry Commission concludes. The fact that it bears no relation to reality matters not at all, it seems. It is an article of faith. If reality does not correspond to its models, reality is obviously wrong. If it has someone very stubborn arguing for reality, the second line of defence is to say, `Well, yes, things are bad because of many factors we didn't account for but they would have been worse without deregulation.' That is what I mean. There is no arguing with a faith which can reinterpret all evidence as support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These commissions start with the assumption that competition and deregulation will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6097"> solve our problems and make us well off. The terms `free market', `competition' and `deregulation' all translate as freedom for massive corporations to exercise their economic might in the market in any way they deem appropriate. The assumption is that this will automatically be competition on the basis of efficiency reflected as a lower price and that, therefore, consumers will get cheaper products, buy more and invest more. I just wonder whether the people who think this have ever read basic first year economic texts about monopolies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to this faith, sacked workers or workers who cannot maintain the real value of their wages and either work longer hours for the same pay or the same hours for less pay will not drag down consumption&mdash;isn't that a leap of faith?&mdash;because they will simply find better jobs because that is how the invisible hand of the market works, rather like angels or spirits. Under this faith, we cannot have unemployment because, if there is a surplus of labour, the price will simply come down, stimulating more demand. I remember hearing about that in the 1930s&mdash;not that I was here in the 1930s. All commodities work that way and labour is, of course, just a commodity. They are not human beings; no&hyphen;one gets discouraged or depressed or feels hopeless. Labour is a commodity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In their fundamentalist vision, labour, workers, human beings are always a cost&mdash;and of course taxes should always come down, no matter what else. There is a zero positive value on employment and standard of living. Any cost in its pursuit is a pure cost, never offset by benefits. The same is true with any regulation to protect the environment or to protect any aspect of society we are foolish enough to value. These are always distortions of the market&mdash;and bad, perhaps even evil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The market, if left alone, will always protect values. The dollar is value, and that is why the price of a thing is called a value. Economic fundy&hyphen;thinking says that value is determined automatically and accurately in the market. If people value something more, they will pay more; if they value it less, they will pay less. They do not pay anything for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> air, so it is obviously worthless&mdash;especially clean air. They pay little for forests and nothing for forest ecology, so they are without value. The fact that people say they value nature and environment means nothing. They do not pay for it, do they?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Necessity never existed for the Industry Commission. People do not have driving needs for food, shelter and so on. Needs are just inelasticities. The reality of being offered a choice between a cut in salary or becoming unemployed is never really considered as a social or personal cost. It is not even considered as a government cost&mdash;and that is a mistake, even on economic grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of losing an industry is not a cost for the Industry Commission. If an industry is so inefficient that it cannot stand up against foreign tariff subsidies, it will die, and the money will simply be invested in a more appropriate and competitive industry. Given the relative inefficiencies, the Industry Commission probably thinks we should be a nation of mine and pulp mill workers who invest heavily in Vietnam, Korea or other nations where they know how to properly exploit workers. Obviously, one of the most efficient jobs possible is to be an investment capitalist. I wonder why the unemployed have not thought of that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Action of vested interests in taking control of a market and so having a willingness to take losses to drive competitors out of business cannot exist in an Industry Commission world. According to them, any business that does not work to maximise profits must be unsustainable. The fact that a company can afford losses for a while in a small area if they are making a profit overall and the result will be larger profits when competition is destroyed does not dawn on them. They do not seem to understand about the power of market dominance and the ability to convert that dominance, once attained, to profit. Nor do they recognise that for a global corporation virtually any nation, particularly Australia with its small population, is a minor part of the global market; nor does it consider that competition is the purest form of a win&hyphen;lose system. In a competition there are one or two 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6098"> winners, with the rest being a large number of losers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Power never entered Industry Commission calculations. When market dominance is large enough, the choices that are offered are controlled, and people may have no choice about the choices they have. Entry cost rarely is considered in an Industry Commission report. The fact is that, when a market is established, it is extremely difficult for anyone to enter. Collusion and distortion by industry is rarely considered. Social considerations or government regulation is seen as a distortion. But the article of faith, the actions of companies, can never cause distortion. They are the operation of the free market. How can the market itself cause distortion?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission is one of the few organisations that not only backed up the Hilmer report but demanded it go further. It has unceasingly called for the shedding of jobs and the abandonment of industries. If its recommendations swung decision making, it is probably responsible for over 200,000 jobs being lost in Australia. Even when it was not responsible for the decisions made, it was an ever present voice out on the extreme economic Sahara of dryness. It could always be counted on not only to support the most extreme measures of government&mdash;at least till Mr Costello became Treasurer&mdash;but also to make disdainful noises about government not going far enough. It created the impression that the most radical economic Right policies were moderate compromise measures by comparison with the ravings of the Industry Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Needless to say, I do not support this bill. I have never seen any point in the expense of the Industry Commission and its inquiries. In most cases they were not worth the paper wasted on them, much less the trees that went to make the paper. One could predict what the Industry Commission's conclusions would be&mdash;and they were always as bad or worse. One of the few exceptions I can think of was the Industry Commission report I read on public housing. It concluded that it was a good and worthwhile thing to have public housing. But the government did what one would have expected the commission to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> recommend and has largely divested itself of public housing and passed any responsibility to the states who simply see it as easy money for their general revenue and the housing as something to flog off in the name of efficiency and choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will vote for the part of this bill that terminates the Industry Commission: schedule 1 of the repeals bill. I will vote against the transitional part: schedule 2. I will vote against replacing it with something worse by voting against the Productivity Commission bill. Worse? Yes, absolutely. The Productivity Commission looks like a deterioration of the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Industry Commission was the far Right for the brand of economic fundamentalism under Paul Keating, the Productivity Commission seems that much worse, just as the economic fundamentalism of the Howard government seems that much worse. I am worried even by the change of name. The Industry Commission mainly targeted industry, working particularly to obliterate our shipping, manufacturing, automotive and TCF industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Productivity Commission? `Productivity' in the jargon of this fundy&hyphen;faith means increasing narrow economic efficiency, and there is only one way of doing that. The Industry Commission never considered technological advances in efficiency or improvements in management and coordination. It was always the `productivity of labour', which roughly translated into getting more work for less money. This meant specifically work intensification mechanisms for holding salaries down by creating insecurity amongst the labour force; short&hyphen;term contracts for workers which could be shed when not absolutely necessary without penalty to profits; and it meant transfers of costs to consumers and clients by increasing waiting times through decreasing staff&mdash;meaning that there are fewer staff and the ones who remain are always flat out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this sort of history of productivity and the absolute opposition of any of the worker benefits in restructuring, as outlined in the ACTU's Australia restructured, I have no positive opinion of anything called a Productivity Commission. I think it will specifically 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6099"> be a labour bashing and job gutting commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate that the ALP is attempting to modify the Productivity Commission into something not quite so odious and antithetical to the interests of workers and other human beings. I do not consider there are any real benefits of a Productivity Commission. So I do not think any but the most absolute modifications effectively throwing out the bill and starting from scratch will work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think modification will work because of the type of government we have and its perspective on labour, society and industry. I will vote against this bill because there is no reason to multiply the fundamentalist voice; there is no real need and no excuse. I hope that the Senate joins me in ridding Australia of the Productivity Commission and the Industry Commission.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summing up, can I say that we have heard from both Senator Kernot and Senator Margetts this evening in relation to various aspects of the Productivity Commission legislation. There seems to be, through the speeches of both Senator Kernot and Senator Margetts, a theme that takes exception to even the concept of productivity. Senator Margetts was more to the point than was Senator Kernot and said that there was some conspiratorial nature to the fact that we dared call this thing the Productivity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot seemed to suggest that productivity was a dirty word. I do not think Senator Margetts said that productivity was bad. Rather, in the context in which we had come up with it&mdash;this nasty bunch of dry, right&hyphen;wing ideologues who had pinned the term `productivity' onto this body&mdash;productivity was a dirty word; that if we had not done it, this might not have been the case. So Senator Margetts was to the point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, for its part, believe in productivity. We believe that increasing productivity is good for Australia&mdash;good for the Australian economy and good for jobs. We do not believe that increasing productivity needs to cost jobs. In fact, what you will find if you analyse the figures is that as Australia's productivity has increased, so has employment in Australia and, in the longer term trend, it has decreased unemployment. So we stand for productivity. We think that having a commission that is dedicated to productivity and to seeking out unfair competition and trying to find ways to abolish it, particularly when it occurs in business between the private sector and the public sector, will assist. It will particularly assist small business.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say to Senator Kernot that in my time in the parliament I have found and have had brought to my attention numerous examples of extremely unfair competition between the public sector and the private sector. Anyone who stands up in this place and says that the public sector suffers a disadvantage when it is out there competing against the private sector needs to talk to some of those constituents who have come to me over the years and who are suffering from unfair competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In her contribution here tonight Senator Kernot also said that she would rather take the $25 million, to quote her, that was being spent on this and spend it on some social impact statements and so forth. I say to Senator Kernot, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that these measures will save the Commonwealth, and save the taxpayer through that, in the order of $22.5 million. Before Senator Kernot goes off and spends another $25 million, she is going to have to find another $22.5 million in savings. I know where Senator Margetts would get that from; she would go straight to the Department of Defence and take that money out of their budget. We know where Senator Margetts stands on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps Senator Kernot could find us another $22.5 million because, by defeating these measures, she will not only defeat a measure which will save the Australian taxpayer $22.5 million, but she will cost us what I regard as an important measure in implementing a key feature of the coalition's election program.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the argument put in Senator Sherry's contribution, which I listened to this afternoon. He talked about this competition and the advice being competitive as well&mdash;contestability and advice. I think Senator Sherry is dead right about that. It was one of the criticisms of the previous Labor government that Mr Keating, the former Prime Minister, was only getting this advice from one area and Treasury was not always giving him the best advice.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say to Senator Sherry&mdash;I would be very surprised if you would disagree with me on this, if not publicly, at least privately&mdash;that I think it is fair to say that in the last decade economic advice and the sources of economic advice to government in Australia and most parts of the world has significantly increased in terms of the source of that advice. You have a whole range of private sector advisers and organisations mostly filled with ex-Treasury staff&mdash;Murphy and his mob and a few other people. It is a fact. It reinforces the argument of Senator Kernot or Senator Margetts that they are all coming from the same religion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that there are a lot of other organisations out there who are providing advice to government. They are not only economic organisations staffed by Treasury officials who pray at the same altar; there are also a whole range of other people who give us advice. There are a whole range of organisations which were brought into the policy process in relation to the decision on the automotive industry in Australia. As is on the public record now, the Industry Commission's recommendations did not get accepted by the government. We listened to a whole range of organisations&mdash;economic organisations, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6102"> community organisations and organisations from a whole different range of places&mdash;when we got that advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are saying that we need a more efficient and focused productivity commission. We need to implement the election commitment. We do not want to see yet another election commitment torn to shreds when it gets to the Senate. We would like the opportunity to implement this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, Senator Kernot does not like competition. She says that that is tough.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, it is our definition. We think competition is good. It is very good for consumers. The great example of competition in the past 12 months has been the competition in the home loan market. That is a classic example. You do not need to go to Chris Murphy or ORANI or any of these people to get a model of competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are plenty of examples where competition works, but the greatest example is what has happened to customers of Australia with the competition that Aussie Home Loans have brought into the banks. Of course, with the implementation of the Wallis committee recommendations there will be a lot more competition out there which will flow through not only to home owners and people with overdrafts but also to small businesses. Of course, the other example is telecommunications, where we have had literally overnight a tumbling of telecommunications charges, which has helped households right across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats do not like competition; they do not like productivity. When an Industry Commission report predicted that $20 billion would be saved from competition policy, Senator Kernot said, `But the reality is that in the end they will save only $1 billion or $2 billion.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would hope that this piece of legislation will go through the Senate without amendment and that, if anything, any amendments that are accepted will improve the legislation. If the amendments to be moved particularly by Senator Kernot and the Greens were successful, the legislation would be emasculated. The government is not interested in that. We do want the opportunity to implement this election policy. It is vital to the

Those people in the Senate who would stand in the way of the government reaching that objective by stopping this important piece of legislation, a crucial part of our electoral mandate, do so because they are clinging to some ideological objective which I think has now been defeated in all parts of the world.

<PARA STYLE="Para">It should be noted that items 8 and 11 are in conflict with opposition amendments 11 and 12. The amendments before the committee go to the heart of the comments made by Senator Kernot during her speech on the second reading stage. They refer to our view, which was clearly expressed by Senator Kernot, as to how the Productivity Commission should be established and how it should operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to speak only to the amendments to be moved in my name during this committee stage. These amendments are the first in a series to be moved by the Australian Democrats whenever the government seeks to insert the exclusive use of the term `chairman' into legislation. They are very simple amendments. They give the person holding the office concerned the right to choose his or her title. They give a person the right to be known as the chair, chairperson, chairman or chairwoman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments are about choice. Given how often we are told that choice is a concept 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dear to the hearts of the coalition, we might have expected such great libertarians to support such amendments. My belief is that they will not support the amendments, but I hope that they will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition will not support the amendments because in this, as in so many other areas, they are not about broadening choice, they are about limiting it. Few things demonstrate that more clearly than this determination to shut the door on inclusive language and to shove down all our throats the desire that a person shall always be known as chairman, irrespective of his or her gender, irrespective of his or her wishes and irrespective of how demeaning, belittling and marginalising that might be to many Australian women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can stand here for hours and debate the origins of the word `chairman', but we all know that in Australia in 1997 it is not an inclusive word. What it did or did not mean in Latin is hardly relevant. We know what it means in 1997 and we know that the vast majority of women chairing organisations in 1997 do not see themselves as chairmen, do not call themselves chairmen and do not want to go through life being called chairmen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are obviously some women who do want to be called chairmen, and that is their prerogative. There are apparently any number of coalition women MPs and senators who are happy to accept their master's injunctions that they call themselves chairmen as well. But, contrary to the view of some parliamentarians, this is 1997 not 1947, the year of my birth, and most women are not so happy to toe some man's line and they can certainly see no reason why they should be forced to toe that line. What if the holders of these positions were to be called chairwomen, irrespective of their gender? Would all the men out there chairing corporations and organisations roll over and happily call themselves chairwomen?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to hear it. But here is the government asking its female counterparts to accept being compelled to call themselves chairmen, apparently on the sole ground that the Latin root for the word is not gender based. Language is a very potent force of both oppression and change. How we use language sends messages about what sort of society we are. What message does it send to Australian women when their national government does not stop whingeing about the clumsiness or political correctness of the word `chairperson' but actually goes out and writes into legislation its own officially sanctioned term of chairman? What does that say, if not that our national government considers most of these positions are and should remain the province of men? The American feminist Gloria Steinem said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New words and phrases are one organic measure of change. They capture transformations of perception, and sometimes of reality itself.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is why we started replacing terms like `policeman' with `police officer', that is why we started using the generic terms of `chair' and `chairperson', because reality was changing, because women were filling these positions and because we no longer wanted to imply that the positions themselves belonged exclusively to men.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can all point to extreme or ridiculous examples of so&hyphen;called politically correct language. That is a pretty cheap and easy shot to take, but it is not one of these examples. This is about an assumption in our language which has changed naturally as reality has changed and which the government now wants to reverse not by force of argument but through force of law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Personally, I do not care if people want to call themselves chairs, or chairmen, or chairpersons or chairwomen. I do not care if they want to call themselves the grand poo&hyphen;bah or the grand wizard. But I believe very strongly, firstly, that they should be able to make that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> choice of title for themselves and, secondly, that government should not be in the business of sanctioning one gender ahead of the other through the official authorisation of particular terms or words. Governments are supposed to be leaders. But this action is not the action of a leader; it is a backward step and one which reflects the agenda of those in the coalition&mdash;it is not everybody in the coalition&mdash;who long for the good old days when men were men and women were women who stayed at home and did not want to be chairpersons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot understand why there has not been a much stronger fight against both that agenda and this particular step from coalition women MPs and senators. I find it very hard to believe that this is a move which sits comfortably with women senators such as Senator Vanstone, or Senator Payne or Senator Coonan, for example. I find it hard to believe they are overjoyed at such a small&hyphen;minded approach which is designed to lead over time to every chairing position within Commonwealth legislation being referred to as chairman. This is of course a completely unnecessary thing to do. It is not required for good government. It is not required to improve services or make organisations work more efficiently. It is nothing more than a petty, pathetically small&hyphen;minded and blatantly sexist measure and it is one which the Democrats reject completely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Chair, I have taken some time to put this case because I want to forewarn the government that it is the intention of the Democrats to move such amendments to get rid of this obsession of calling everybody chairman every time a bill emerges with that word in it. So you have to face up to the fact that you are going to be called to account on that and have to go to a division every single time that you produce such a statement. Thank you, Madam Chair.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Chair, it will probably not surprise you to hear that I will be supporting this amendment wholeheartedly. Several months ago, when a male Deputy President was in the chair, I deliberately referred to him as madam chair. I wanted to do that because so many people argue that language is irrel 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6107"> evant and that often women&mdash;and I am really pleased that Senator Murray is moving this amendment&mdash;are making a big thing about language. I wanted to see at the time what would happen when you actually called a man in that position by a term which refers to a woman. The interesting thing was that the first person to call a point of order, if I recall correctly, was Senator Bob Collins. He jumped up in outrage and said something about the fact that Senator Colston was not wearing a skirt or a dress.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought that was really interesting, because I have never heard that point of order called before when a woman has been referred to as chairman. Nobody has stood up and said, `She has not got certain parts of the anatomy which relate to a man.' It is interesting, isn't it, that people should actually take offence, as if it is an insult that they have been referred to in a term which relates to a female. Yet those of us in the community who do take offence&mdash;yes, who do take offence at being marginalised and made invisible by the language&mdash;are considered to be petty in bringing this up, not by all people but by some people who persist in trying to change language but then tell us that we should not take it as seriously as we do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Language is important; you only have to find out how people feel about the way language is used around them and to them to know how important it is. Despite the people from the Australian Labor Party and the government who have jumped up at times, I hope that commonsense will prevail and that a step in the right direction of choice will be taken in the use of language in the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment proposes to adjust the definition of `industry' in clause 3 of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R104">Productivity Commission Bill 1996</XREF>  to that which is consistent with Labor's preferred model of making the Productivity Commission a specific reference body rather than a more general reference body. This is consistent with the theme of concern and, indeed, deep suspicion and scepticism that we have with the government's reorganisation of the Bureau of Industry Economics, the Economic Planning Advisory Council and the Industry Commission into this Productivity Commission. The consistent theme that runs through our amendments is that the Productivity Commission, if it is to exist, should be very sharply focused in a variety of ways&mdash;much more sharply focused than the government is proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment contracts the definition of `industry' from one which includes Australian industry in general to one which confines the scope for reference by the Productivity Commission to particular industries or parts of industries. We believe that this will allow the commission to still focus on specific issues within industries, which should allow greater emphasis on practical considerations&mdash;I emphasise that word `practical'&mdash;as opposed to an overly theoretical approach which could arise from a much more generalist reference, which is the course the government appears to wish to take.</PARA>

We believe that it limits it beyond the definition which is in both the Industry Commission Act and the PC Bill. We believe that by excluding `industry' in general, it could therefore restrict the nature of industry references and the economy&hyphen;wide focus of the Productivity Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an example, we believe that the regional adjustment and the charitable organisations reviews under the previous government would be problematic with this wording. We do not believe that it should be narrowed in this way. In fact, I think it is contradictory to the sentiment that I heard flowing through the speeches of the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot) and Senator Margetts, who said that we should be taking into account social, environmental and other community factors. It limits the sorts of references that can be done in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We regard this as a potentially very significant amendment. It is one the government could not live with because we think it is too restrictive. We heard arguments during the second reading stage from, I think, all senators in the debate that there seemed to be a monopoly and a narrowing of the focus of the Productivity Commission under the whole scheme. Yet this amendment, which is the first main amendment in the committee stage, specifically seeks to narrow the focus of the commission to industry in the narrower sense of the word.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In view of the broad theme that I outlined earlier&mdash;the squashing together, if you like, of the old Industry Commission, BIE and EPAC&mdash;we think it is entirely appropriate that the focus of the Productivity Commission should be sharpened to specific industries or part of an industry or a group of particular interests.

I do not think charities and non&hyphen;government organisations should fit into this definition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of other amendments I will support, depending of course on what I hear in the chamber, but on this one I am not sure that changing the definition of `industry' will achieve what the opposition really wants. What it might do is leave Treasury unchallenged. The concern that I, the opposition, the Democrats and the Greens have&mdash;and I believe, if they could speak, that probably a number of the government would have&mdash;about this measure is that the diversity of economic advice that is currently given to the government will be seriously affected if this legislation goes through as it is. As has been said by speaker after speaker, it will result in the Treasury being virtually the sole organisation upon which the government will rely for economic and industry advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People can say what they like&mdash;and often do say what they like&mdash;about the Industry Commission but the Industry Commission, on a number of occasions, has quite strongly in its reports taken to task the sort of philosophy that you would expect to emanate from Treasury. They have been quite independent on occasions. All of us around this chamber who are familiar with Industry Commission reports would agree that the Industry Commission has, on occasion, taken to task&mdash;not by name&mdash;the sorts of viewpoints that are expressed by Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern about this amendment is that it will severely limit the functions of the new commission and thus affect the ability of the commission to express its views on industry as a whole or on areas; for example, regional areas, which the minister has mentioned.

I can think of one particular employee who has given us very valuable evidence and guidance on this legislation. We are not confident that that culture for which we have some sympathy would, with respect to Senator Harradine, continue.

In fact, as I was listening to Senator Sherry I have been reading through the debate on the establishment of the Industry Commission back in November 1989. Peter Morris actually 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6110"> went to this matter of the definitions clauses and said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, tonight we have heard of many people who do not agree with everything the Industry Commission has come up with since November 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To more specifically answer the question, the government would of course rely on advice, as it does now, from a range of different sources, and clearly not only the industry commission. We would get advice from other departments of government. To reiterate, we just cannot see the merit in trying to limit the role of this body in this particular way. All it can possibly do is narrow things and give it less opportunity to do its work, which we believe is important.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just in response to the issue that Senator Harradine has raised, we see that there is ample scope for government to receive advice from a variety of sources. Senator Campbell has referred to government departments. There are Senate reference committees that do very good work. There are private sector think tanks&mdash;all too many of them to the right of centre&mdash;and universities. There are a range of other organisations in our society which have produced and will produce extremely effective, comprehensive reports on a vast range of issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our fundamental fear is that compression of the two organisations into the Productivity Commission will refocus many of the provisions for its establishment&mdash;and we will be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> getting to further amendments later. It will refocus, driven essentially by a Treasury agenda, because it is the Treasurer (Mr Costello) who has driven this reconstruction&mdash;or destruction, in the case of a number of the organisations that we are dealing with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very concerned about that refocusing that is to occur and emerge from this Productivity Commission. With all of the resources of Treasury, which are enormous, it is certainly the overwhelmingly dominant economic advisory organisation in this country. Those Treasury officials watching the debate may be somewhat concerned, but I have no doubt that they will have an enormous influence through the Treasurer. I am sure they will be advising the Treasurer as to the terms of reference, the industries to inquiry into, and it will have a much more Treasury centred focus, and that is of major concern to the Labor opposition.</PARA></SPEECH>

The Productivity Commission should be a reference&hyphen;based research body: that is, the minister tasks the Productivity Commission to investigate certain matters and the commission then produces reports on the matters referred to it. These additional powers&mdash;and they are massive ones&mdash;are unnecessary or incongruous with the core function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the proposal to make the Productivity Commission the investigation body for complaints on competitive neutrality grounds, we consider this to be clearly a function outside the normal role of a research body. To investigate complaints about competitive neutrality issues is an important function, but the proper Commonwealth body to undertake this function is clearly the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission or its successor body, and I understand there will be some statement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) tomorrow in respect of this matter. We certainly do not believe that investigating complaints about competitive neutrality issues is an area for the Productivity Commission.</PARA>

He said that we should actually benchmark these things; that we should look at these things in a sensible, independent way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments again seek to narrow what the Productivity Commission can do. We do not want that narrowing. We want the Productivity Commission to have the power to undertake a broad range of functions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly on a matter which I hope senators will read and take an interest in. On 4 August this year National Missing Persons Week was launched and there was a breakfast in the Great Hall which was attended by police involved in the area and a number of people who had suffered the loss of a person from their family. It was a very moving occasion. They spoke about the numbers of people who go missing, how soon some of them are found and how long it is before others are found&mdash;perhaps never.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The highlight of the morning was an address by Maree Dawes, who told us her own personal story. I was quite taken aback when in the first couple of sentences of her speech she said, identifying the times, `And I became the daughter of a missing person.' My first reaction was that she had perhaps got it wrong. I expected her to say, `I became the mother of a missing person.' But that was not the case. Mrs Dawes became the daughter of a missing person. And her mother did not have Alzheimer's disease; people with Alzheimer's disease who wander off are generally found quite soon. It was a very moving story about the impact of a woman who had been active with her family, within her community, loved by her grandchildren, et cetera, who has just not been seen since. Mrs Dawes also dealt with the legal implications of this situation which were faced by the family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to take up the time of the Senate tonight in going through the speech. But it was a very moving account from

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two years two months and four days ago my life changed in a way I could never have imagined. I became the daughter of a missing person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A mother who was well, mentally and physically, a mother who was devoted to her family, not just her children and grandchildren but to her extended family, brother and sister, nieces and nephews and friends, friendships that in some instances go back for 45 years.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pain is never ending because there is no resolution. Every day I look at her photograph and ask `where are you&mdash;what happened?'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why did this happen to a kind gentle women whose contribution to the community was expansive. A lady who was known for her generosity. A lady who was loved by all who knew her.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The answer is the phenomena of missing persons knows no age, social, economic or cultural boundaries. It can happen to any family at any time, anywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It must be remembered that this is not solely a domestic issue. For families who have a missing loved one overseas the task of searching is far more difficult. The difficulties of communication because of distance. Laws of the country involved that make it almost impossible to obtain information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When we talk of missing persons it is important to acknowledge those families separated by war, political and religious strife. Families torn apart by circumstances way beyond their control. Brothers and sisters who have not seen one another for 50 years. Husbands and wives separated and never able to be reunited. Children who have been denied the opportunity of knowing one or both parents.

Families often reflect this need to blame someone in the form of anger with the Police&mdash;it is simply too painful to blame ourselves. The Police are professionals, they understand but sometimes that blame is reflected on a partner or another family member. This can be enormously damaging to family relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Initially there are lots of people around, family, friends and of course the Police are in constant contact searching for that vital piece of information that will give them the lead they need. But as the days turn to weeks and the weeks become months the expectation is that you will "get on with it". Friends don't know what to say and so they stop calling in and the phone stops ringing and you are left with the pain&mdash;the desperate need to know. Are they alive or are they dead? The feeling of isolation can be overwhelming. I remember only a couple of months back I had two mums in my car&mdash;both had sons missing. One son missing for six months the other 16 years. They both talked of the loneliness of their pain, of how members of their families would not allow them to talk about their sons&mdash;it was as if their sons had simply never existed.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . .

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have a long way to go. On behalf of all families with missing loved ones I beg those of you here today who are in a position to make the necessary changes to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a person is missing by choice then that is their right but as parents, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters we need to know if they are alive. If they are dead we need to bury them&mdash;to say our goodbyes and deal with our grief. It is the not knowing that is so hard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a source of enormous frustration to families that the Police are often hampered in their investigations because of the Privacy Laws. We, the families, acknowledge and accept the right of any individual to choose to seek a new life, to remain removed from their family for whatever reason.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However we believe that we have the right to be told our loved one is alive, however they choose at this time not to be in contact. Then at least we know what we are dealing with and the path forward is easier.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only those with missing loved ones can know what it feels like to wake to the news on the clock radio and hear the words "A body was found". The stomach does a back flip, the heart starts to pound and so you wait for further bulletins. Is it male or female, young or old? Is this my loved one.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is much that needs to be done to assist the families of missing persons. The establishment of the NMPU was a major step forward. It must not stop there. The need for a Missing Persons Committee, representative of all the appropriate agencies working in the field, together with the establishment of family support groups in each State is essential.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I would like to add my comments to your contribution on the issue of National Missing Persons Week which was held in early August and also, in doing so, to mention the work of the National Missing Persons Unit. This unit was established in December 1995, and is funded by the Commonwealth government for the four-year period following 1995. It is housed here in Canberra and its work deserves recognition, given that its contribution to society is made by no less than just three, four or perhaps five officers. The work done by this unit services the communities in this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we heard from Madam President, the emotional circumstances surrounding a person going missing within one's life are quite devastating. I would like to quote a very brief excerpt from the speech of Maree Dawes. It relates to the issues of privacy&mdash;and herein lies an implication for us, as legislators, to look at the laws relating to privacy. I think Maree Dawes sums it up very succinctly, when she says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a source of enormous frustration to families that the Police are often hampered in their investigations because of the Privacy Laws. We, the families, acknowledge and accept the right of any individual to choose to seek a new life, to remain removed from their family for whatever reason.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However we believe that we have the right to be told our loved one is alive, however they choose at this time not to be in contact. Then at least we know what we are dealing with and the path forward is easier.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This issue presents a grave conflict to people such as myself who believe wholeheartedly in a true regime of privacy for individuals in Australia. However, there is then the plea of Maree Dawes on behalf of people in her situation with their need to know of the fate of their loved one. The use of information contained within the bureaucracy to advise them one way or the other can do a great deal to address their concern and their need to know about the fate of their loved one.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would say in this contribution: let us recognise the work of this particular unit which contributes greatly to the needs of people in times of emotional distress; and also let us recognise the individual devastation wrought upon those in our society who are touched by a missing person.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6115"><TITLE>Diana, Princess of Wales

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, both your point and that made by Senator Lundy are worthy of comment and in some ways are a preamble to what I want to start my contribution with this evening. First of all, Madam Speaker, you mentioned the pain of children who lose a mother, and I wanted tonight to take the opportunity to make a personal statement of my shock and sadness at the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps many things can be said about this woman&mdash;I think, a very special woman&mdash;but there are two things that stand out for me. One is the pictures of her being able to hold and touch people with AIDS at a time when the world was terrified of this disease. With that very simple gesture, she gave an example and courage and heart to thousands of people. One only has to remember what happened to a family with a child with AIDS in northern New South Wales, as I recall it, and how that family was hounded out of society by fear and ignorance. I think Diana's action in embracing a child, as I recollect it, with AIDS and also shaking the hand of an adult with AIDS sent a very splendid message which said that it is perfectly possible to live lovingly with people who do have that disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I remember about Diana was the absolute priority she gave to her role as mother. Perhaps the saddest part of her very untimely death is that those two lads of hers will now be without a mother. No doubt they will have people who will care for them. But it is quite clear that she was a particularly important person in their lives, and she valued so importantly that role. Having worked for many years with children and mothers who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6116"> were getting out of kilter with each other, I have always placed great store by that role of mother. I think in some ways that might be the saddest part of Diana's death&mdash;that all of us feel for those young men, boys, who now have to go into the world without her frontrunning and, in particular, loving them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point Senator Lundy makes about privacy is very important. I can say that this came up once in an estimates hearing. It was a particularly fascinating time in estimates; Senator Richardson was the minister&mdash;and it might surprise people that Senators Walters, Peter Baume and Rosemary Crowley were all of the same view. The Social Security Department which, in the name of privacy, would not inform parents of where their children might be caused Minister Richardson to say that this was something that needed to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was proposed&mdash;and I do not know whether it ever was properly implemented&mdash;was that people should be able to be told that their children are safe. The child's right to privacy&mdash;for there to be no indication given of where they were, and so on&mdash;should be protected. But at the same time, there was a recognition that it is right for parents who might be anguishing about a child to be given the assurance that they are safe. Even though it may be that nothing further can be said, and that may not be satisfactory, it is some way to deal with the tension Senator Lundy raised&mdash;although I am not sure that it would solve the particular case she mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having spoken on such serious matters, I want to take a few minutes now not to be flippant at all but to turn to another matter: the disappointment I feel about the current government's failure to continue to develop the previous Labor government's initiatives of promoting women in sport. I have had the pleasure of attending two grand finals in the last couple of weeks. I went to watch the netball final between the Adelaide Thunderbirds and the Melbourne Phoenix, and last Saturday I watched the women's basketball final between the Adelaide Lightning and the Sydney Flames. I might say that it is something I should never attend because both teams I was there to support lost.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in both games we saw a level of sporting excellence that I believe is still largely unknown to and unrecognised by Australians because of the very insufficient coverage of women's sport. Anyone watching those games would know just how fit and fantastic our women athletes are, whether they are netballers, basketballers or athletes of any sort. So I would draw attention to those games. Certainly there is increased media coverage. Thank goodness for the ABC.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most of the television coverage comes by kind favour of the ABC. It shares its film with some of our pay TV carriers. In particular, there was some newspaper copy&mdash;minimal, but certainly a bit of an improvement on what it was in 1984&hyphen;85 when I first reported to government on women's sport in the media. Even so, one would have to say the coverage in last weekend's papers was anything but sufficient for the excellence of the game.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite interesting to know how well women's basketball is doing in the United States. They are in the process of establishing a significant women's league. It is also interesting to note that one Australian player, Michelle Timms, is hugely successful and popular&mdash;and possibly the No. 1 women's basketballer in the world. I understand that she was rated as No. 5&mdash;perhaps that was in the recent games. She has done a huge amount, with her own skills and ability, to promote women's sport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a pity that last year the Prime Minister's women in sport awards just did not happen&mdash;and there is no accounting for why. We have not been told that there was a saving to be made or a decision that we would not proceed with them. It is a terrible disappointment when something of that sort that was enabling, with the coverage of such an event, the achievements of women in sport&mdash;across a whole variety of sports&mdash;to get some acknowledgment and celebration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also very disappointing to me that since the death of Margaret Pewtress, who was head of the women's sports unit, there has been no replacement woman in that position. It is not sufficient that there be more 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6117"> women on the Sports Commission; there is a position and I believe and argue that there is still a long way to go before women and sporting coverage of women's sporting achievements are anything like equal. It is far too early to be retreating from those small initiatives that had been put in place to encourage the development of women in sport and the variety of media coverages of their achievements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am told that the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, Warwick Smith, was amazed at the recent basketball night awards for the most valuable player. I do have to say that Adelaide Lightning may have lost but at least we produced the most valuable player, Rachel Sporn, who gave a speech, as the captain of the losing team of the Lightning versus Flames match, that anybody and everybody should have access to as a speech of great grace. It is certainly my line that you cannot be a championship team if you have not beaten a team of champions. I would certainly say that is true of both the netball and basketball finals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister Smith was reported as being amazed at the capabilities of these players not only to perform brilliantly but also&mdash;as I understand it&mdash;to talk; to make good speeches. One wonders what Mr Smith has been hearing footballers say. I am glad that he thinks women can speak beautifully at the end of a sporting achievement and I sincerely hope that Minister Smith who, not too long ago released a report on the insufficiency of media coverage for women, will&mdash;</PARA>

Finally, I would like to say that it was interesting to note that Trish Fallon, the most valuable player for the Sydney Flames and part of the winning team the other night, was reported as being&mdash;and she agrees&mdash;about twelve weeks pregnant and Jackie Delaney, who was a member of the losing team in the netball final, was also pregnant and at about the same stage. This is causing a lot of people to be shocked and horrified but those of us who have been 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pregnant know that women who are pregnant are not enfeebled, not pathological and not suffering a sickness. They are as fit and as able as they must necessarily be to protect the next generation.

In particular, I would like to refer to a conference that took place last weekend, 29 to 31 August, in Old Parliament House: the inaugural Australian Youth Forum. It involved more than 350 young Australians from all over the country and aged between 16 and 21. On Sunday there was a luncheon held in the Old Parliament House and a number of politicians were present. I acknowledge the presence here tonight of Senator Bill Heffernan&mdash;who is getting rather excited in the corner, thinking I would not mention him&mdash;and Senator Kate Lundy. There were a number of other federal colleagues there: Dr Brendan Nelson, Mr Bob McMullan and Senator Marise Payne. So there was cross&hyphen;party representation at that luncheon. It was a summary luncheon, designed to give politicians the opportunity to hear first&hyphen;hand the types of discussions that had taken place over the preceding two days. The topics covered ranged from youth suicide, self&hyphen;esteem, racism, youth rights, education, employment, entertainment, Australia's future, drugs and youth homelessness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge all members of the parliament&mdash;Senator Lundy and I have given notice of a motion on this today&mdash;to read the summary recommendations and respond, regardless of their party background. It was a truly motivational lunch. I assume that the colleagues in the chamber felt that invigoration and the inspiration that came from those young people. They were genuinely motivated and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6118"> excited; not just active and informed citizens. There was a real sense, through motivational speakers as well as a genuine valuing of those young people's input, that they could make a difference and effect change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess the overwhelming recommendation and message that some of us received on Sunday was still the sense that young people feel that politicians are not responding adequately or seriously to the concerns of young people. They want very much&mdash;certainly the delegates at this conference wanted&mdash;more opportunities for young people to be involved in the decision making processes of this country. This is clear from reading some of the comments by delegates. Perhaps I should refer to some of the comments. One of the delegates, Aaron Fowler, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it's high time the Government of today started to realise that the youth of Australia should not only be seen but be heard!</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Ali Duggan said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like the people in power in this country eg&mdash;politicians, to listen to what we say this weekend. These will be a lot of great ideas that come out of this forum this weekend. These ideas should be taken seriously and noted down. Hopefully everyone will be able to put these ideas into action so that this weekend can be successful.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Jenny's vision for the future was to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">salvage the environment, employment, no racism, drug abuse down, the 16 yr. vote (way for youth!) rights and suicide is gone man!</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So you can see, Madam President, from some of these comments, the range of topics that were discussed. I strongly felt that a lot of young people at that conference yesterday countered some of the negative images perpetuated by some decision makers, some politicians and some mainstream media. They certainly countered some of those negative impressions. They did not talk about being given power or being given permission to act. They talked about empowering themselves and each other and acting on the rights or grasping the rights to which they are entitled. They were clearly conscious of the changing position of young people in our society&mdash;you could argue, the erosion of young people's rights in our society&mdash;the changing nature of access to education at all levels and the vital connection between unemployment and self&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">esteem and, of course, unemployment and poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The willingness of these young people to embrace change and to work for a brighter, fairer and, I note, greener future, was inspiring and I know this will be commented upon in future adjournment debates by colleagues such as Senator Lundy. I congratulate the organisers, the sponsors and the facilitators of this conference. I congratulate Here for life for their emotional and financial support and, of course, the primary organiser, J.J. Kahla. I got the impression that this guy stops at nothing. This was clearly a goal and a dream that he had and he had every intention of turning it into reality. He had the idea that 350 young people from around Australia would meet in the nation's capital, and they did, with marvellous great success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can tell that this event was an inspiring one for me&mdash;to see young people claim power and working for goals such as accessible education and a sustainable economy. It filled me with hope, as did their recommendation that more young people should be in this place. I note that it came on the heels, if you like, of a week of heated debate in this place, in particular, last week's urgency debate on privacy, which the Democrats considered a matter of importance. It is a debate that has been touched on this evening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The demeaning things said to me in that debate do not really affect me personally. In many respects, I think I am becoming an experienced enough politician, despite my age, which seems to bother some politicians in this place so much, to not take the abuse personally. But the language of Senator Abetz and Senator Chapman last week&mdash;likening me to a dog on a leash and calling me a kid&mdash;sends a strong message to young voters in this community and young people in this country that they are not welcome in this chamber and they will, if they wish to contribute to the political life of this nation, have to put up with insulting and demeaning stereotypes and insults on a daily basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people, in their despair over employment opportunities, how to pay for their education and how to have some hope in today's cruel and often anti-youth culture, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6119"> need representation almost more so than any other group in our community and society. Their voting patterns suggest that they do not have a lot of faith in the old party structures or in politicians generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not often make personal reflections but in this case I was stunned by some of the language used last week by Senators Abetz and Chapman. They would do well to see that the language that they use almost on a daily basis in this chamber and elsewhere plays no small part in the cynicism and the disillusionment that young people have with politics. Never witty and never wise, they are only abusive and narrowly focused on party one&hyphen;upmanship. The comments are anti-youth and it betrays generational unease, a fear and importance that young voters pick up, despise and laugh at. Yet such senators as these dare  to say at times that young people are our future. We must be wary of that hypocrisy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to acknowledge Senator Lundy's poignant comments about privacy tonight, a subject which Senator Crowley also referred to. Obviously, privacy is a particularly relevant issue this week. I suggest that a matter such as that would be well debated and discussed in the Senate committee to do with privacy, not only to do with the private sector but perhaps journalism and public life generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that it has been a unique day in this place as members and senators have reflected on the terrible tragedy that took place yesterday in Paris. I can only add my sentiments to those of Senator Crowley and my support for the motion passed earlier this day and express the grief that many Australians, young and old, monarchist or republican, feel about the loss of this young and modern woman, Diana, Princess of Wales, a woman&mdash;I hope people will forgive me paraphrasing Portia in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Merchant of Venice</EMPHASIS>&mdash;who `shined for her good deeds in a naughty world'.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6119"><TITLE>Northern Territory: Election</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Saturday saw the election in the Northern Territory of the eighth term of office for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Country Liberal Party since the fully elected Legislative Assembly came into being in 1974. That was a very important election. It is very important that it is the eighth consecutive win for a very successful political party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to comment tonight on some aspects of both the campaign and the potential that it now offers the Northern Territory for the next four years under a government to be led by Chief Minister Shane Stone. Mr Stone and 24 other Country Liberal Party candidates maintained a very aggressive, very blunt and very factual campaign to the electorate of the Northern Territory. They are to be congratulated on the excellent result that they achieved in all 25 electorates. At this stage it appears from the counting that the new Stone government will be at least 16 members, possibly 18, with an outside chance of even 19. That of course leaves the Australian Labor Party with only six or seven members in the Northern Territory parliament. That is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also congratulate Suzanne Cavanagh, the President of the Northern Territory Country Liberal Party, and the hundreds of party members and hundreds of territorians who threw their weight behind the support of what was a very credible and competent campaign that was also built on&mdash;this must be recognised&mdash;the Country Liberal Party's ability to pre-select candidates which identify with the particular electorates and issues of an important part of Australia. It is well known that the Northern Territory has only one per cent of the population of Australia but, equally important, its success is measured by the fact that it now produces two per cent of the export earnings of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The body politic of the Northern Territory is an important issue. The fact that the Country Liberal Party was able to maintain a campaign of professionalism and community involvement is extremely important. That campaign compared markedly with the campaign that was run very doggedly through mistaken advertising by the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party imported into the campaign tactics reminiscent of the United States of America, particularly in referring to individual candidates as `pigs' and importing into the campaign a number of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6120"> past has-been politicians, such as Mr Whitlam, Mr Melham and former leaders in the Northern Territory, Terry Smith and Brian Ede&mdash;none of whom had any relevance to this contemporary campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to recognise that the Northern Territory is uniquely different in national politics. It is a very mobile community. Probably 30 or 40 per cent of the voters at this election were not in the Northern Territory four or five years ago. The mobility and the youth of the Northern Territory is equally important when we look at issues such defence, lifestyle, our relationship with Asia and how that impacts on government policies completely in the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commented on the fact that this identification with the electorate is probably one of the most important issues. In relation to the results that have been achieved, the swings were marked in both Labor and Country Liberal Party seats, but I draw attention very particularly to the swing of 16 per cent in the seat of Arnhem, in Arnhem Land. Whilst the Country Liberal Party probably will not win that seat, that is a very significant swing in that electorate. In the seat of Victoria River, which the Country Liberal Party won at the last election with Mr Tim Baldwin, there was a further 10 per cent swing in an Aboriginal constituency. In the seat of MacDonnell, the seat centred to the west of Alice Springs and which includes the area out to Ayers Rock and a number of Aboriginal communities, the swing was 18 per cent. John Elferink is to be congratulated on that very special result in this election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proves that Aboriginal people have walked away from their past reliance on the very heavy&hyphen;handed politics of the Australian Labor Party, particularly where they have continually thrown money at problems without gauging and properly assessing the outcomes and effects. Aboriginal people are now very competent in and very capable of making their own political judgments, as they have done at this election. I draw attention to the success of community government throughout the Northern Territory in Aboriginal communities, an initiative of the Northern Territory government which is now gaining a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> groundswell of Aboriginal momentum and that will see changes in the future to structures such as land councils, to ATSIC and to many other areas where Aboriginal people need to look at the structural defects in many of the Labor&hyphen;imposed previous institutional arrangements put around them. The Country Liberal Party return gives them this opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party and many others on the Left also made in this election campaign accusations that issues of racism had surfaced. I would like to counter that very deliberately by saying that certainly issues that affected Aboriginal people were put on the table very clearly, and Aboriginal people and the Northern Territory community made their own judgment, particularly in the area of financial accountability, where the Labor Party just let loose and did not have any adequate controls. Those issues should be and are properly being addressed both by this federal government and also by the Northern Territory government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to the issue of development, which underpins the economy of any community, it is important that land policies be addressed. Whether it is Aboriginal land rights, native title, Mabo or Wik&mdash;all of those issues again were properly adjudicated on, this time in a number of those seats, by Aboriginal people, who very strongly endorsed the policies of the Country Liberal Party rather than those of the Australian Labor Party which have failed the Aboriginal constituency and failed the Northern Territory in its economic development so strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was an important election last Saturday. Shane Stone is to be congratulated not only for the result but also because of the confidence that he imbues, the relationships that he has built with the Howard government and how that augurs well for the development of a north-south railway and for statehood, the vision that he takes forward into the next four years, and the recognition that this can be done by proper professionalism and whilst recognising the unique lifestyle of the Northern Territory.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  on 25 August one found an article which attacked both the RSL and its National President, Digger James&mdash;a man known to many in this chamber as a man of great integrity and great courage and a great Australian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, this was not the first time that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> has run this article. It would be the third or fourth time that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> has rehashed&mdash;and grossly inaccurately rehashed&mdash;this same story. I wonder: what are the motives of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> in doing so? I certainly understand the motives of the people who purport to be an oppressed minority within the RSL. But their public facade and their claims are quite contrary to the facts. I believe it is important that the facts about this case go on the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In December 1994, a small group of people, who featured, as I said, on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 24 August, took the RSL to the Federal Court claiming that the RSL was anti-democratic and oppressive. Of course, in taking the matter to court, they also made great play of that matter in the media. But in the 2&half; years that have transpired between then and now, these people have done nothing to test their case in court. They have done nothing to bring the facts before the court, to let the court adjudicate on these matters. What they have done is left this complaint sitting in the Federal Court and gone to the media time and time again suggesting that the RSL was anti-democratic and that the RSL was shortly to be rapped over the knuckles by the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if these people had any integrity, if they valued the reputation of the RSL itself, then they would have taken the case to the court and not to the media. What they have indulged in is not a trial in the justice system; it is a trial in the media, where the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> seems to be the judge, the prosecutor and the executioner. That is gravely tragic. It is tragic for the RSL and it is tragic for the executive of the RSL who do so much good work for veterans in this country. That is the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These wild allegations were put before the court but were never tested. These people 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made no effort to bring the case on. They have procrastinated, they have delayed, they have used every possible ruse to attempt to avoid bringing their litigation on. The reason for that is very simple: the material they have tabled in court probably does not even support their spurious allegations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that, since that case went to the Federal Court, Digger James has been re-elected a number of times as the National President of the RSL. If Digger James were some sort of tyrannical monster, as they try to portray, that would not have happened. But he has the confidence of the national organisation. That is what these people cannot live with; that is what they cannot accept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it the case that this is, in fact, a small group fighting for the underdog? Quite the contrary. The underdog in this case is Digger James; the underdog in this case is the RSL, which has had its reputation slurred in the media and, yet, has not had the opportunity to answer it either in the media or in the court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My understanding is that the RSL's national executive would love the opportunity to have these allegations contested in court. But that opportunity has not been given to them by the complainants because the complainants want the case to sit in the court file but to never see the light of day in a court room. While it sits in a court file they can continue to go to the media and slur the integrity of people like Mr James and others who serve on the national executive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that one of the men who is a complainant in this case, I understand, has made such a nuisance of himself that the RSL has had to provide Australia Post with a written directive not to allow him to continue his unauthorised collection of national and state RSL mail from the post office. If this is not a clear indication that there is a campaign of harassment against the RSL's national executive and against its president, I do not know what is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am gravely upset that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> has time and time again sought to slur this great Queenslander and this great Australian and sought to slur the RSL. If the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> is really interested in the truth, if the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> is really interested in reporting the facts, it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6122"> would report the fact that these complainants have made no effort to bring their case to court. If the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> was really interested in the underdog, if the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> was really interested in ensuring that there was a fair and a democratic system, why haven't Digger James and the RSL been accorded the same opportunity to put their case as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> has accorded to this small, disgruntled group of people over and over again?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I can draw my own conclusions about the motivation of this small, disgruntled group of people, but I cannot understand how the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>&mdash;a paper which purports to be interested in truth and integrity could allow this sham to continue. I believe it is incumbent upon them to apologise to Digger James and to put the other side of the story&mdash;a story which will reflect, I believe, quite well on both Digger James and the RSL national executive. It is about time the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> started to praise this organisation for the fine work it does instead of attempting to tear it down in the ruthless and unscrupulous fashion in which it has done to date.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="10.28 p.m." PAGE="6122"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 10.28 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before the awarding of the contract, local agents can assist with bid preparation and contract negotiations. During project implementation, agency costs can relate to facilitating customs clearance, arranging delivery of goods, obtaining permits necessary to undertake works, etc.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Securing of the overseas contracts takes place through commercial negotiations prior to aid/Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) finance becoming available.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) and (2) Please refer to the attached tables outlining the Department's compliance activity for 1995&hyphen;96 and 1996&hyphen;97 to 31 March 1997. Information by age group is unavailable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The information for the last quarter of 1996&hyphen;97 is still being finalised and figures for the financial year as a whole will be provided when available. It is difficult to estimate the expected effect of compliance measures in 1997&hyphen;98 due to the complexity in quantifying the impact of voluntary compliance on review outcomes. As the Government takes a stronger stand on compliance matters, through, for example the new activity test arrangements, it is expected that more customers will voluntarily comply with their notification obligations.</PARA>
