<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;On Monday I received three questions and two supplementary questions on aged care, and on Tuesday in a question Senator Forshaw quoted from a statement he said I had made in the Senate the day before.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The Senate, by resolution, required Senator Alston to table the first ACIL Economics report on waterfront reform and related material by 5 p.m. yesterday. He did not. Not only did he fail to table the material required by the Senate, he did not even bother to give this chamber the courtesy of an explanation. There was a call to my office by one of his staff after 5 p.m. to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> advise that the government planned not to observe the return to order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as if this request by the Senate came out of the blue. The documents that are the subject of this return to order were first sought by the Senate through the estimates process in August this year. We were told in those hearings that the ACIL consultancy was commissioned by the department. We were told that the department let the tender and we were told that the work had been completed and the department had the report. But we were denied the document and we were denied important details relating to the second contract let without a tender process to this company. Even though there was nearly $700,000 of taxpayers' money spent or committed on the ACIL consultancies, the very committee process established to scrutinise the expenditure of public money was denied access to the material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Thursday the Senate considered a motion that required Senator Alston, the Minister representing the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, to table the ACIL material denied to us in estimates. In a statement Senator Alston advised the Senate that the material was commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence. He said it was cabinet&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence, and he added that its release could put people's physical safety at risk. Given Senator Alston's revelation, the matter was postponed.</PARA>

I think the Senate is entitled to an explanation, and in what has been said this morning I have heard not one word about the government's willingness to come in here and explain to the Senate why it is defying an order of the Senate. All I have heard is that Senator O'Brien might get a phone call.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you will let me finish&mdash;that I should continue my remarks now and that Senator Alston will respond later, and we will continue the debate later. But I believe it is appropriate that I put on the record, in continuing what I said, that I wrote to Senator Alston last Thursday, following the statement that he made, representing the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith). In that letter, which has been incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> , I sought clarification of the alarming matters he raised in the Senate last Thursday. My letter provided him with an opportunity to justify his claims, and Minister Alston replied on Friday. Again, his response has been incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I think it is fair to say that he failed to clarify a number of the key issues in his statement. We have no idea as to the nature of the commercial damage to the Commonwealth or others that might result from the release of the material. We have no idea as to the nature or extent of the damage that might be caused to Commonwealth relationships with the states, and we have no idea as to the validity of the minister's claim that people's safety might be threatened if this material is released. The Senate, therefore, cannot make a judgement about accountability, commercial and cabinet sensitivities and people's safety, because the minister will not let it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Thursday Senator Alston told the Senate that the release of the material could endanger the physical safety of a person or persons. If people's safety is at risk as a result of this consultancy, I assume that the Minister for Justice (Senator Vanstone) has been 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8286"> advised, and I assume that she has taken action to protect those people who are exposed to physical harm. I would appreciate advice from the Minister for Justice on that point. If that has not happened, the government has placed itself in a position where it has information that a person's physical safety is at risk but has not acted to protect that person. Alternatively, if the government is using this defence simply as a means to deny the parliament important information about a key area of reform, as appears to be the case, the minister should be condemned and the material provided to the Senate immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government identified the maritime industry as a key policy area in the lead&hyphen;up to the last election. It remains an area of great interest, not only to this parliament but also within the community generally. In fact, Minister Reith was on the radio this morning discussing that matter, and there are meetings occurring today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government inherited a division within the department of transport with both expertise and experience in waterfront reform. That division costs taxpayers approximately $60 million a year and has a staff of over 50 officers. The government chose to add to that substantial resource by engaging a consultant, who happened to be a former employee of the Liberal Party, at what is now appearing to be a cost approaching $700,000. It is, in our view, in the public interest that this material be released and there is no practical reason why it cannot be tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has been aware of the Senate's interest in this matter since August. Notice of this motion was given on 17 September and the report has been sitting with the department. The Senate's deliberation of this important matter is being frustrated by the actions of the Minister for Workplace Relations and his representative in this place. They are ignoring key issues of both public interest and government accountability and they are in breach of a resolution of this place. The Senate not only has the right to properly examine this material; it has a responsibility to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that, if the minister is interested in finding a way of satisfying the order of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senate or finding some way in which an independent person, agreed by the opposition and the government, can examine the material to establish and, if necessary, remove any areas that require removal under commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence or on the grounds of personal safety, that may be an option which we can discuss profitably. However, no such discussions have taken place and the opposition can only assume that there is no intention to seek to satisfy the order of the Senate in any way. I remain open to discuss this matter with the minister when he is available. I look forward to his comments on the matter. The government can rest assured that we will not let this matter rest at this point.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking in continuation on this <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R265">Native Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill</XREF> . The bill goes to the qualifications for appointments of presidential members of the National Native Title Tribunal and provides for the establishment of a register to enable temporary appointments to the tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill allowed me to make some remarks on general native title administration. Yesterday I referred to a claim made by the Undumbi people on the Sunshine Coast and I pointed out a number of claim restrictions that they wanted to place on properties. In point (o) of their claim, they claim a right to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . grant or refuse permission to any other person to do some or all of (a) to (n) either at all or subject to terms and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is an issue that the Native Title Tribunal will have to look at very closely. Families out west have overlapping claims on their properties. Why should they not be anxious?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The author of the article I quoted from yesterday made a lot of the alleged fear that properties would be taken away from farmers. Neither the NFF nor the National Party of Australia have ever told leaseholders that this would be the case. The article claims that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) travelled to Longreach to counter the mischievous information pastoralists had been fed. I was at Longreach and I have been to many meetings where the issue of native title has been raised. People are not fearful of losing their properties. They are fearful of how coexistence can work, how there can be two titles to the one piece of property; fearful of how native title might develop and restrict their family, living and business activities; and fearful of years of court cases before they will really know where they stand on their own properties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does anyone honestly think that, if we believed properties were going to be grabbed, the National Party of Australia would not have kicked up a major stink by now on that issue? It has not happened. There never was any major concern on that point put out by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> any reputable organisation. There are too many other real things to be worried about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The article mentioned a land valuer who said that not one of his company's Queensland valuers has found a single sale which can be said to have been devalued by the Wik decision. Firstly, it should be pointed out that one does not have to sell land in order for it to be devalued. Indeed, devaluation would be a definite disincentive. Secondly, the schedule to a QIDC lending document gives the corporation the discretion to decide that the value of a property has been reduced by virtue of an Aboriginal claim in respect of actual or alleged rights. The existence of a claim on a property can constitute an `event of default' where, in the opinion of the corporation, such circumstances materially reduce the value of the mortgaged property or materially adversely affect the financial position of the mortgagor and/or the debtor.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existence of a native title claim is clearly seen by this major rural lender in Queensland as pivotal to the value and financial viability of the property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to refer to a letter from one of Australia's leading banks which states, in reference to a property sale negotiation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bank will not countenance any further delays, particularly given that the security property is not apparently in a `Wik' affected area.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is an acknowledgment that sales in Wik&hyphen;affected areas experience delays and difficulties because of it, and all of this is important for the tribunal to understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is quite obvious that the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> has got it wrong when it comes to the implications of native title for property sales. The country's major banks consider it a definite factor in their lending services policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The author found one pastoralist who thought the Aboriginal people wanted to take her farm. Of course, she was surprised that that was not the case when she sat down with the local Aboriginal people. As this pastoralist said, `the most important thing to them is recognition.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the author failed to mention is that the claims start off with the local Aboriginal people with whom the leaseholders have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8288"> grown up or at least know well. What happens then is that the representative Aboriginal body gets involved with the registration and, from then on, leaseholders have to deal with quite a different group of people, whom they do not know and who have legal and other resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example, which the tribunal ought to look at, of how this can make it very difficult and complicated to get agreement was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> on 24 February this year. I am very glad Senator Woodley is in the Senate to hear this. The tribunal ought to be be able to understand this. A Cape York cattleman, Alan Pedersen, had been negotiating successfully with local Aborigines with whom he want to school in Mareeba. Some are among his closest friends. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I started talking with the elders but they got pushed aside and the solicitors and the land councils got into the act.</PARA>

It is when the elders get pushed aside and replaced with solicitors and strangers that the difficulties arise, and the good working relationship between black and white Australians that existed in the bush before native title is irreparably damaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Native title negotiations are not achieved by sitting across the kitchen table with the friendly locals, as the article's token pastoralist will unhappily find out. The author is correct in assessing the whole situation as providing three basic options for farmers: legislate, litigate or negotiate. If both sides cannot agree, as in the Pedersen case, with interference from lawyers and radicals, then there are two options left. If legislation does not give certainty, there is only one option left and that is litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the author noted, times have been very tough in the bush over the past decade. There is no money for litigation, so what then? There is no need to cultivate fear. Don McGauchie is only guilty of trying to protect his people from their legitimate concerns. In that, he has the overwhelming support of rural Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Labor opposition, I rise to speak on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R265">Native Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill 1997</XREF> . I wish to address my remarks to the role of the tribunal. In doing so, I take exception to the sorts of approaches that Senator Boswell has made, because they reflect a very narrow view of native title and of the role of the tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition will be supporting the part of this bill which amends the Native Title Act&mdash;in clause 1 of schedule 1&mdash;to allow the president of the tribunal to appoint an acting registrar for a period of up to 12 months. We believe the government has made out its case for that part of this amendment bill and we will be supporting that clause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we will be opposing that part of the bill which downgrades the qualifications necessary for appointment as president of the Native Title Tribunal. The government's amending legislation provides that a person may be appointed as a presidential member if they have been enrolled as a legal practitioner 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8289"> for at least five years, whereas the current arrangements provide that they must be a member of the judiciary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has a number of reasons for taking this stance. It is the case that there has been some discussion on both sides of the parliament about the merits of this proposition, going back to 1995, and there have been some discussion papers which looked at changing the qualifications required for a presidential member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fair to say that it is probably not a life and death issue, and the Labor opposition accepts that there is sustainable argument on both sides of this particular case. The reason why we take the position we do at the moment is because of the context. The strongest argument is that the current context we find ourselves in is not one in respect of which we want to send any signal about the downgrading of the role of the tribunal or the role that the president plays in the operations of the tribunal. You cannot divorce this debate from the general debate about the government's Wik plan and the next native title amendment bill, which we will be dealing with in the next couple of weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think that having a president who is a judge or a former judge adds to the stature of the tribunal and to the impression of impartiality, authority and integrity that attaches to the tribunal. As I said, in the current context we think that is a very important thing and worth defending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role Justice French has played has been an excellent one and I will make some comments about that in a moment. We have come to the view that we ought not do anything that would be seen to be downgrading his function and the role he has played. We think, therefore, on balance that it is preferable at this stage to oppose that part of the bill and we will be doing so in the committee stages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that Justice French holds a contrary view. He has stressed on a number of occasions the mediation role of the tribunal and in general terms I accept his emphasis on the tribunal's work in mediation. But I am more inclined to share the view that Mick Dodson expressed in his report on native title for the year ending June 1996 when he said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This proposal may undermine the standing of the NNTT. In the establishment and consolidation phase of a body with the significant and unusual functions of the NNTT, it is vital that it be perceived as credible and impartial.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On balance we prefer to support the view that Mick Dodson expressed, largely because of the context of the current debate about native title and the important role that the tribunal will play in the development of native title over the coming 20, 30 or 40 years. That is one of the things I will be stressing in the coming debate, that we need to take a much longer term view about native title and the development of native title than people have been prepared to take. When we look at the experience in other countries, we see we are at a very early stage in the development of native title and we must take a much longer term view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking to the bill and the role of the tribunal I want to pay tribute to Justice Robert French who has proved to be an outstanding appointment. I think that is a view shared by all sides of the parliament. He has done a very difficult job extremely well. One of the signs of that is that at various times all the parties involved with the tribunal have seen fit to criticise him as leaning too far one way or the other in terms of the decisions he has made. I think he has been at pains to stress the mediation role of the tribunal. He has made himself available all around the country. He has spoken at conferences and meetings. He has done all he can to foster the role of the tribunal, to foster its acceptance and develop an understanding of its role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Justice French has shown enormous sensitivity to Aboriginal culture and Aboriginal people's relationship with country. He has played a pivotal role in helping to broaden public acceptance of the concept of native title and the role of the tribunal. Clearly there is much more to be done but I would like to express my personal thanks for the role Justice French has played. When he does move on from the tribunal it will certainly be a great loss.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to comment on the role of the registrar of the tribunal, Ms Patricia Lane. She has been instrumental in the very difficult job of establishing what has become an efficient 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8290"> and effective organisation. She has been responsible for building up a highly competent and committed staff complement at the tribunal and generally has done very well under quite difficult circumstances. If the tribunal is allowed to play its proper role in the coming years it will make an important contribution both to the development of native title and more generally to reconciliation in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been extremely fortunate to have two such highly capable people involved at the early stages of the development of the tribunal. When the current hysteria regarding native title subsides their role will be more widely recognised and the effective role that the tribunal has played in the first few years of the operation of the Native Title Act will also be more widely recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my great concerns is that there has not been enough support for the positive role the tribunal has played. Some of that criticism can be levelled at this parliament. We have not done enough to support the role of the tribunal, foster understanding of native title and deal with the misunderstandings that exist in the community. I know that the native title parliamentary committee of which I have been a member since its formation has had to confront a great deal of that misunderstanding and the need for information in the community but has just not had the resources to be able to respond to those needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to conduct ourselves in this debate in a very responsible manner. There are a number of public figures who have not conducted themselves in a responsible manner in the native title debate and I must say that the conduct of the native title committee's inquiry into the Wik amendments has added to the tension and misunderstanding that surround native title. I do not think the role the committee played in this inquiry has been a positive one. I think the partisan nature of behaviour of members of the committee, the rudeness displayed on occasions to witnesses and the general lack of decorum shown has brought the parliamentary committee system into disrepute and has lowered the respect for parliament and the committee system that the general public hold.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not making these comments in any political partisan way; I am not pointing the finger. I think we have all contributed to that problem. We do need to have regard to how we conduct ourselves. I know the President has received complaints about the conduct of the committee and the conduct of members of the committee, and that is a disappointing thing. We have to show greater respect for the process and for witnesses. The Women for Wik are one example of witnesses who were patronised. That is an unfortunate development. I do not want to be too pious about it because I think all members of the committee have to share the blame and share responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point that we have a role, particularly in the coming debate, of helping to contribute to reconciliation rather than of contributing to the division and concern in the community about native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the strengths of the tribunal has been its innovative and responsive approach. It has managed in a number of ways to bring Aboriginal culture into the operations of its mediation hearings and has been able to respond to Aboriginal cultural practice and custom in a positive way, which has been good for the work of the tribunal. It has been positive in terms of the outcomes that have been achieved and has allowed Aboriginal people to participate in the tribunal's processes in a positive way. There has been some criticism, particularly in the early days, from some groups about some of the processes that were adopted. This is a credit to the tribunal, and it is something this parliament has to take note of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly concerned at the decision of the parliamentary committee not to organise the translation of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses in their own languages at the hearings in Broome on 6 October. A particularly powerful presentation was given by local Aboriginal people, some of whom travelled hundreds of kilometres to present to the committee. Because a number of them were much more fluent in their own language, they chose to give evidence in that language. While I did not understand the words, I certainly felt the sentiment and strength of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8291"> emotion when they talked about their relationship to country and culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a terrible indictment of this parliament that the entry in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> records, for example, the evidence of one Mrs Maggie Long, a Jaru woman, as:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence was then given in a language other than English&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That witness gave a quite moving and detailed presentation. Yet that is the only reference in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . It is an indictment of this parliament that we have not been able to respond in a more positive way to recognise and understand the evidence that was given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out that I am not making a criticism of Hansard in this regard. They did a tremendous job at these hearings in quite difficult circumstances. It seems we have not been able to find a way through to organise for this translation to occur. I do not understand that. I took steps following the evidence being given to the committee; I spoke to someone from the law and culture centre in the Kimberley about organising a translation. They said they were perfectly willing to do that provided the parliament provided them with the tapes and some funding for the translators to translate the evidence and make it available for inclusion in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got tied up in some sort of bureaucratic argument about who is going to pay for it and whether or not it is possible. I understand that the committee might even be writing to the witnesses now telling them that they can, if they like, provide translations of their own evidence. That is a terribly inadequate response and an indictment of this parliament. We really must do better at accommodating the witnesses who provide evidence in their own language. These are the original inhabitants of this country. The parliament really has on obligation to do much better than we have done on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, it reflects very badly on the parliament. I think a lot of people will see this as a sign of how seriously this parliament takes Aboriginal views on this Wik legislation when we cannot be bothered to make the effort&mdash;considering all the resources that we spend on things that are of far less priority&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">to make available in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the evidence of those witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to labour the point. It really is a disgraceful situation and we must fix it. I am most concerned that the parliament do much better at allowing those Aboriginal people's points of view to be available to the wider community and to be understood by senators. Apart from being able to pick up the emotional impact of the evidence, I do not have a clue as to what those people said. Neither do any other members of the committee. Ten or 11 witnesses gave quite extensive evidence and we have not had the benefit of understanding what that evidence is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return to Labor's formal position on the bill and indicate that we will be supporting the bill but we will be seeking to oppose schedule 1, item 3, page 4&mdash;lines 20 to 27&mdash;which is the provision the government is moving to effectively downgrade the qualifications required for the appointment of presidential members. Apart from that position, we will be supporting the bill. We will be arguing that in the current circumstances that specific item of the Native Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill 1997  be opposed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R265">Native Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill 1997</XREF> . By all accounts, this is not a large or complicated bill. It is, however, a significant one. As outlined in the government's second reading speech, the first two amendments concern the qualifications for appointment of the registrar and presidential members of the tribunal. The third amendment provides a temporary appointment of the registrar by the president of the tribunal, and the fourth amendment provides further clarification of when a member of a tribunal is considered to have a conflict of interest in an application or inquiry before the tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the main, the Australian Democrats do not have any specific problems with this bill. However, we do share the concerns of the ALP about the watering down of the stature of the president of the National Native Title Tribunal from that of a judge to some other suitable person.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8292">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that previous speakers have gone beyond the purpose of this bill and have craved indulgence to make a few comments that perhaps do not address the bill directly but address the whole issue of the debate which surrounds the bill. I am afraid I am provoked by Senator Boswell in this instance because I doubt that he addressed the bill at all in his speech&mdash;except to give the tribunal a couple of whacks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that, if this is an indication of the government's attitude, then one must put some weight on the fact that the government wants to water down again the stature of the president of the tribunal and therefore to reduce its effectiveness. You cannot have it both ways. If Senator Boswell thinks that the tribunal is not operating properly, then he also should vote with the opposition, the Democrats and I presume the Greens to strike out that particular amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was provoked by Senator Boswell. The claim that the National Party and the National Farmers Federation have not created fear in the bush is&mdash;I do not know what words to use to respond to that&mdash;the most bald&hyphen;faced claim I have heard in this place. To see evidence of that one only has to refer to the television ads that the National Farmers Federation tried to broadcast and then, in great surprise at the response they got from around this country about the racism inherent in those ads, apparently withdrew.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that in Queensland the National Party has created so many problems over the years. I have 35 years of experience of their appalling regard for and record on Aboriginal and Islander affairs. When we come to the 10-point plan amendments obviously I will speak about this a lot more, but let me give one illustration. My own church, the Uniting Church, was the administrator of the community of Aurukun in North Queensland for 70 years. This in fact is the community where the Wik people live. We use this word `Wik' as though it refers to some ephemeral theory that is resident in only the High Court. In fact, the Wik people are real people and they live at Aurukun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Uniting Church, because it had moved to give the people there a measure of self- 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">determination and was, together with the people, learning what that meant, had absolutely horrified the Queensland government because it wanted to keep them in ignorance and in the state in which they had lived for generations ever since the Queensland government had taken some interest in Aboriginal people. After 70 years of administration, the Queensland government, over the wishes of the people, gave the Uniting Church three weeks to quit the administration of that community and caused turmoil which continues to this day. So let us not pretend that the National Party in Queensland is not one of the fundamental causes of the problems we face in that state in relation to Aboriginal and Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I get a little stirred up when I hear Senator Boswell making those kinds of claims, although normally he and I agree on a lot of things. I challenge Senator Boswell to do the same as his colleagues in the National Party in the House of Representatives. It has been announced in today's media that Bob Katter and other members of the National Party will cross the floor. That will not make any difference to the numbers in the House of Representatives, where we know the government has the overwhelming numbers, but it would make a difference in the Senate. If Senator Boswell is really fair dinkum that the amendments that the National Party are to move are going to make a difference and help farmers, let us see them cross the floor here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us see whether these are just words, which is what we usually hear from Senator Boswell, or whether we are actually going to see him take some action. That is the only way that farmers in Queensland can have any confidence that he really means what he says, otherwise his words mean nothing. So we will be waiting with great interest to see whether or not the National Party supports its amendments not only in the House of Representatives but here in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me continue to deal with the bill. As has been mentioned in the House of Representatives, the true situation of the National Native Title Tribunal is borne out by a closer reading of section 110 of the Native Title Act, which provides for a judge or a former judge 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8293"> to be a presidential member. I would like to put on the record the appreciation and thanks of the Australian Democrats to Justice French for his considerable hard work in advancing the cause of reconciliation in this country. His very special personal qualities as well as his legal expertise epitomise the sort of person that we think should head the National Native Title Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All sides of politics have acknowledged the good work the tribunal has done in what has been a very difficult political environment. We believe that this recent experience adds weight to the assertion that the tribunal's composition should remain the same. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the Labor Party's amendment to this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R265">Native Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill 1997</XREF> . As has been mentioned by other speakers, during Senator Boswell's statements it was hard to comprehend that that was what we were doing because they were mainly about responses to and knee&hyphen;jerk reactions about native title issues in general. Considering Senator Boswell continued in that vein, I would like to comment first of all on some of the issues that were brought up by him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Boswell quoted some of the words on a particular native title claim. I have been in situations in Western Australia where an angry pastoralist also quoted words from a native title claim. I find it extraordinary that the representative bodies of farmers and pastoralists have not provided even the most basic information to their members about what various phrases on native title claims mean and what the counteracting clauses&mdash;the `notwithstanding' clauses&mdash;mean also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it extraordinary that the leader of a party in the Senate should actually quote those words in the Senate without any reference to those counteracting clauses. This is what causes fear within the community. Words like `exclusive possession' are counteracted by the clauses that say `notwithstanding'. We know that those `notwithstanding' aspects have in fact been clarified by the Wik decision in as much as they say, `Where there 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is a conflict, the interests of the pastoral leaseholders prevail.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also disturbed to hear the government ruse, if you like, of using the word `title' in relation to lease. That is trying to make people believe that what they have in terms of a pastoral lease is the same as a title. It is not the same as a title in the sense of land ownership and never has been. It always has been a limited right in relation to title to pastoral leaseholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nature of native title is not possible to define because it relates to what the land means to traditional owners. Because of that, it is rarely possible to be able to define native title in terms of one title for one piece of land and one title for another piece of land. The natural way of native title&mdash;that is, what land means to traditional owners&mdash;means that there are overlapping traditional claims. That is the way Aboriginal society in Australia works. There is not a boundary which says, `This is the end of this interest of this group of people and this is where the interest of another group of people starts.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are reasons why some groups have chosen to try to all be included on one legal document, but that is a totally different thing&mdash;whether it is possible for all of those people with a traditional interest in land to go on one legal document. There are reasons, and often good reasons, why there are separate physical claims, because sometimes it is like overlapping circles and networks. That is the way native title is understood by the people in that area. It is outrageous to suggest that we should expect Aboriginal people's understanding of their meaning of land to somehow fit into the white Australian society's view of land ownership. It is outrageous to suggest that it is their fault for not doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having got that off my system, I would like to address what we are actually supposed to be here talking about, which is the Native Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill 1997 .</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a reference to the speakers list will show, I had not intended to speak in this debate on the Native Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill 1997, but I am happy to do so for a few minutes. Having followed the debate, as I did closely this morning, I hope that it will not be too much of a gross departure from the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conventions and practice of the Senate if I actually, for a minute or two at least, talk about the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Chris Evans has already noted that one of the few provisions of this bill before the parliament is to provide for a downgrading of the appointment of the presidential member from the current requirement of that person to be a judge to being a legal practitioner of five years standing. As Senator Evans also said, this is not a dying in a ditch issue for the opposition, but we feel that it would be inappropriate at this time to have a downgrading of the position in the context of what is clearly a fierce and very controversial&mdash;and, I imagine, will remain a very controversial&mdash;debate on the whole question of the operation of the tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons that I am pleased to be able to say a few words in the debate this morning is to join Senator Evans in commending Mr Justice French for the superlative and professional way in which he has carried out his almost impossible duties of being in charge of the tribunal. Mr Justice French would have known at the time of his appointment precisely what he was taking on and that it was highly unlikely, despite his best and most professional efforts, that he would get too many thanks from anyone for the job that he was doing, or ever succeed in pleasing anyone in terms of the decision that the tribunal was likely to make. I join Senator Evans in publicly acknowledging the effort that he put into it and the professionalism with which he carried out that work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Justice French will certainly take from that position when he leaves a reasonable place in history in respect of native title and the efforts that he has made, as Senator Evans said. In promoting the work of the tribunal he has been absolutely tireless. I also want to place on record my thanks for the job that he has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the provisions of this bill it will be possible to place in that position a person who is not a judge but who has five years standing as a lawyer. I notice that one of our more illustrious and distinguished lawyers in the Senate has just joined us, Senator Vanstone. Years ago as a non-lawyer I used 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8295"> to dip my lid to lawyers who had the appellation after their names of `QC', standing for Queen's Counsel. I was ignorant enough many years ago to be very deferential to people who had the title of QC after their names on the basis that they were very illustrious lawyers indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the period of time I have spent in politics I have met a number of Queen's Counsels, and the Queen, had she ever been in the unfortunate position of requiring their counsel, would have been in very deep water indeed. Nevertheless, generally speaking across the profession the title of QC or, as it has been far more appropriately termed now in some jurisdictions, SC, meaning Senior Counsel&mdash;in other words, it is a distinction provided by the profession to its peers&mdash;did hold some weight, some standing, some status in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, over the last week or two the distinction, the standing, of the title QC has been rather severely degraded in the jurisdiction of the Northern Territory, in which our Chief Minister has simply appointed himself a QC without the endorsement of the Northern Territory's Chief Justice. The Northern Territory's Chief Minister practised for only a very few years at the bar, from, I believe, 1982 to 1987. It was a short career indeed. The only thing that he did of any legal distinction during those few short years at the bar was to be found guilty of unprofessional conduct by the Northern Territory Law Society, one of a very few lawyers who have ever had that particular distinction. But on the basis of that record, recently, without the endorsement of the Northern Territory's Chief Justice, he appointed himself as a Queen's Counsel, thereby degrading the standing and the status of that office to something you would pull out of a cornflakes packet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be possible under the provisions of this bill for someone with the title of QC, whose only distinction in the law is to have been found guilty of unprofessional conduct by the Law Society, to be appointed to head up the native affairs tribunal. I would hope that the Attorney-General is not foolish enough to appoint someone of that standing, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with a fake QC after his name, to that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to say a few words following the contribution that Senator Woodley made to the debate. Senator Woodley quite rightly and vigorously responded to Senator Boswell's assertion that the National Farmers Federation has not in any way contributed to misunderstandings about the application of the Native Title Act in Australia and the decisions of the High Court. If only that were true. I stand here as a person who had a close, amicable and, I think, positive relationship with the National Farmers Federation over a number of years. Between the government and the National Farmers Federation we achieved a great deal of good work on behalf of primary producers in Australia. I would like to think so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I was utterly dismayed and disheartened to see that appalling television campaign, which thankfully the NFF has not repeated, of the two young children, one black and one white, playing a child's game. That was not only offensive, it was not only divisive but it was factually inaccurate, which is the part about it that I really disliked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That ad purported to give people in Australia a story about the decision on Wik. What offended me about that advertisement&mdash;and I saw it many times in flight from Darwin to Canberra on the inflight entertainment systems and elsewhere&mdash;was that, when the two children were playing that game and the black hand and the white hand were descending on the board, on every single occasion the black hand would come down on the piece of property first, then followed by the white hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What offended me about that was that, whatever else you might say about the Wik decision, the cold, hard legal facts were that in Wik the court found that, where native title might be established&mdash;might be established&mdash;and where that might be in conflict with the rights of a pastoralist, the rights of that pastoralist would prevail. In other words, if you really wanted to be that offensive, the white hand should have come down first, followed by the black hand.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8296">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people in this country want to scream such racially offensive, stereotypical garbage on television, then at least they should try to be just slightly accurate while they are doing so. I deeply regret that ad. I deeply regret even having to criticise the National Farmers Federation because of the long and, I believe, as I say, mutually productive relationship I have had with them. But I certainly do hope that the National Farmers Federation, who have been wise enough not to repeat a similar advertisement on television, do not advertise in this way again.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.39 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;It is useful to allow the National Native Title Tribunal to quickly fill a temporary vacancy in the position of registrar. It is acceptable to provide for the functionary role of registrar to come from a more diverse field of suitably qualified candidates. And it is sensible to have further clarification of when a member of the tribunal is considered to have a conflict of interest in relation to an application or inquiry before the tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the fourth change that is proposed in this bill is far more problematic. Currently, only Federal Court judges or former judges from any jurisdiction can be appointed as presidential members, after the relevant documentation crosses Mr Howard's desk. The bill seeks to change this requirement so that a person who has been a legal practitioner for at least five years can be appointed as a presidential member, and this inserts a new subsection in the table contained in section 110.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, there are five presidential members, including the President, Justice French; and 13 ordinary members of the tribunal. Two of the current full&hyphen;time ordinary members are Aboriginal. An ordinary member is only required to have been a legal practitioner for at least five years. The main difference between an ordinary member and a presidential member is the power to direct. For example, only a presidential member can direct the registrar not to accept an application because it is vexatious or frivolous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principle of non-judges being appointed to presidential positions may appear on the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> surface to be perfectly reasonable; for example, many experienced practitioners may have extensive knowledge about Aboriginal issues. Secondly, judges are nearly all ruling class middle&hyphen;aged white men&mdash;and this is a paradigm which should be broken down; and to select from a select pool of people could be considered as inappropriate for the Native Title Tribunal. To this end, there are no Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander judges or ex-judges in Australia. Thirdly, the current President, Justice French, is on record as supporting the proposed changes. In his August 1996 submission on section 110, Justice French said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This section as it presently stands sets out the categories of membership of the Tribunal and the qualifications for appointment to those categories. The amendment extends the qualifications of Presidential Members to include persons who have been legal practitioners for five years or more. The amendment is supported. It will provide greater flexibility in the appointment of Members to the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">My fourth point is that, in addition, the government appears to be finding it difficult to find presidential members. Justice French wishes to resume his Federal Court duties but has recently been persuaded to remain until at least the end of the year. There does not appear to be in the NTA any provision for the position of Acting President. In addition, the government can no longer compel judges to sit on tribunals&mdash;and that came in Wilson v. Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. However&mdash;and this gets to the heart of the matter&mdash;it is unclear whether the government is simply rejecting many possible appointees, especially ex-judges, because those willing to take up the job are perceived as being too progressive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very importantly to the Greens, Aboriginal people we have spoken to, such as Commissioner Mick Dodson and others from various Aboriginal corporations, believe that the requirement that presidential members come from the judiciary should remain. There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, they believe that the government is wanting to open up the field not to appoint presidential members who are more appropriate but, to the contrary, to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8297"> appoint people who will do the government's bidding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, they believe that it will lower the stature of the National Native Title Tribunal, which has come under considerable attack in recent times, and that this will become just another area where Aboriginal people's fora are downgraded. Thirdly, judges are less likely to be influenced by the government which has appointed them than a lawyer. Judges have had the experience of working in an environment with clear separation of powers, and will respect the need to remain independent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Commissioner Dodson in particular has much more trust and respect for the judiciary than the government. In our conversation last Friday, he said that it was the judiciary who gave Aboriginal people native title and the government which is attempting to extinguish it&mdash;and that, of course, is a salient point. Commissioner Dodson wrote in his 1995-96 Native Title Act Report:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This proposal may undermine the standing of the NNTT. In the establishment and consolidation phase of a body with the significant and unusual functions of the NNTT, it is vital that it be perceived as credible and impartial. This perception would be undermined if the President and Deputy President of the NNTT were not required to have judicial experience. I therefore believe that the proposed amendment is inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The importance of Aboriginal people having faith in the independence and standing of the NNTT is absolutely crucial. Given the current attacks on Aboriginal people by this government, it would undermine the whole native title process if Aboriginal people felt the tribunal was `stacked out' with government lackeys.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should we not look at any changes that the government makes with regard to the native title process with extreme scepticism? After all, it is this government which, in the words of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Fischer), is seeking to enact `bucket loads' of extinguishment. It is this government which is seeking to destroy the right to negotiate process, including, under proposed section 36, taking away the tribunal's power of determination with regard to future acts when the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister considers that a decision has not been reached in a `reasonable' time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to native title, one shudders to think what a minister of this government would consider to be reasonable. It is this government which is proposing, under the new section 82, to change the rules of evidence to make it far more difficult for Aboriginal people to present evidence in a manner which takes into account their cultural concerns. We heard from Senator Evans today a disgraceful story of a situation where the traditional owners of an area did not have the courtesy of having their evidence translated to be made available to the Senate and the people of Australia. That is the situation we are dealing with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against the trend in law to make rules more flexible, this government wishes to reimpose the hearsay rule to exclude genuine evidence from indigenous claimants. Perhaps they will also exclude evidence that is not in English. Well, we are an English speaking country, are we not! The utterly ethnocentric proposed section 82 really seems to echo the shameful mutterings of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) more than that of the government, which has a serious debt and responsibility to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of this country. It is part of the continual scapegoat politics mentality in Australia. That is, take your eye off the ball, the main game&mdash;that is, what is happening in the country with social issues, the gap between the rich and poor, unemployment, and the attacks on the community&mdash;and push that ball on to those people who have the least ability to be able to fight back. That is scapegoat politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should we believe this government when it says that it only wishes to remove the requirement for the President to be from the judiciary in order to `open the field'? This government has created a climate of mistrust with regard to  Aboriginal affairs which has not existed since the dark times when indigenous people were considered non-citizens. It cannot now expect us to take it on good faith that this change is being enacted to enable the appointment of a more appropriate President. The fear is real and apparent that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8298"> this government is more likely to use this amendment to appoint someone far less appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has made mention of the necessary scaling back of presidential powers of determination due to the effect of the Brandy case, which held that administrative tribunals cannot act in a judicial capacity. However, it is currently unclear&mdash;and research is being conducted&mdash;whether the removal of powers, such as being able to reject an application, are necessarily due to the effect of the decision in Brandy or whether the government is seeking to weaken the National Native Title Tribunal for political reasons. In any case, even if the Native Title Amendment Bill is enacted, the President will retain significant powers as the chief decision&hyphen;maker of the tribunal, and any suggestion that such a role is purely administrative is inaccurate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, I have signalled the fact that the Greens (WA) support the ALP's intention to omit schedule 1, item 2, which seeks to weaken the role of the President. I think this is vitally important. We are hearing in the media today of a proposal in the lower house to put some sort of beads and trinket amendment to the Native Title Amendment Bill. From this we can assume that none of the issues raised by the 1,600 people who gave evidence and produced submissions to the joint standing committee is important enough to be taken notice of. Perhaps some of the evidence was taken notice of but not other parts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can also assume that somehow or other it will be fair and reasonable to extinguish native title and to offer freehold title on crown land which nobody else wants&mdash;that is, until someone finds something which they want to mine&mdash;and which is not and never will be anywhere near a town. That is the beads and trinkets approach that we have got from the government and from coalition members. That is why nobody in their right mind would support the downgrading of the presidency of the Native Title Tribunal.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to thank all senators for their contributions to the debate, although I have to say that I am 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> personally deeply resentful of the kind of contribution that has just been made by Senator Margetts, with her gratuitous, narrow&hyphen;minded attitude and prejudice about what one major political party thinks versus another. Clearly, she has a misunderstanding of what has actually happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I personally would prefer if debates in this place were conducted on the basis of what had substantively happened as opposed to people tossing their own prejudices from one side of the chamber to another. One example of that is the remarks by Senator Margetts that this government deals with indigenous communities in a bead and trinket fashion. That does not seem to be the type of contribution that this debate merits. This debate merits a more substantive contribution and a more substantive argument than the pejorative assertion of a beads and trinket approach. It is not something in the past that I would have expected from Senator Margetts, but that is for her to be responsible for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before turning briefly to finalise the debate, I mention Senator Bob Collins's views on the capacity of people to acquire the title QC. Interesting as that may have been to some members, I did feel slightly miffed that Senator Collins chose to focus on Mr Stone in the Northern Territory because, if you want to look at people who have had themselves appointed QC and argue the case as to whether it was meritorious or not, you need look no further than the other chamber in this parliament, the House of Representatives, to the now Mr Gareth Evans QC. Ask yourself whether that was a meritorious appointment and whether he had to, in fact, go and beg and plead with the Chief Justice in Victoria to get himself nominated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is particularly fascinating about the title QC being held by Mr Evans is that he is a republican. That is no big deal&mdash;I believe not only that Australia will become a republic but that it should, so I do not single him out in that respect. But I do single him out as being a republican who just cannot bear to give the commission `Queen's Counsel' away. He could give it away. He could say, `This is no longer representative of what is appropriate in Australia. I don't want to be the Queen's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8299"> Counsel. I am going to give it back.' Do you see someone like the former Senator Evans giving his commission to be a Queen's Counsel back? No, you do not. It is just more of the two&hyphen;faced lily&hyphen;livered rubbish that comes from the other side. Nonetheless, I will leave that be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point in question that has perhaps had most focus in this debate is the question of the need for a judge or otherwise. It is probably worth running through the argument that the bill will downgrade the status of the National Native Title Tribunal. It is not the government's view that it will do that. The amendments address the implications of the High Court's decision in the Brandy case by transferring the determination&hyphen;making function of the National Native Title Tribunal to the Federal Court. Under the new scheme all applications for compensation and native title determinations will be made to the Federal Court and the court will have sole responsibility for making any determination concerning native title or compensation. Under the existing regime, a presidential member can direct the Registrar to accept or not accept an application for consideration for the tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was appropriate for presidential members to be judges or former judges as they could in effect overturn a decision of the Registrar. The new regime provides that all applications for a determination of native title will be made directly to the Federal Court. So presidential members of the National Native Title Tribunal will cease to have any function in relation to the acceptance of claims. This new regime for processing of native title claims is largely based on the amendments included in the Native Title Amendment Bill 1995 introduced by the previous government at the end of 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the tribunal will no longer apply an acceptance test it is no longer necessary or appropriate for presidential members to be limited to judges or former judges. Judges are not the only people with the skills needed to lead the tribunal effectively. That is the government's position. In closing, I endorse the remarks a number of people have made as to the contribution of Justice French.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am absolutely sure this <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R280">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4)</XREF>  is the bill that Senator Murphy wants to pay particular attention to. It involves the thin capitalisation issue that he particularly among the senators on this side of the chamber is interested in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the clock struck me down last time on this matter, I was part way through my speech. I would like to pick up that speech where I left off and refer to the backdown by the government in terms of offshore groups here. The education and training industry in particular is concerned about the possible effects of the redrafted legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, International Training Australia&mdash;ITA&mdash;has written to the opposition 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expressing their concerns about the bill before the Senate today. ITA is a private company whose shareholding is comprised solely of Victorian government enterprises. It was established to combine and coordinate the training and education capabilities of the Victorian TAFE system in large&hyphen;scale overseas projects. ITA is very concerned that the provisions in this bill will impact on its members' current drive to increase the export of Australian educational services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For commercial reasons these Australian educational institutions often have to establish foreign subsidiaries or Australian subsidiaries which do not operate principally in Australia. These bodies are not engaged in tax avoidance, but they may be caught by this legislation and, hence, lose their tax exempt status. Clearly this would be a poor outcome for the nation, as these bodies are in fact engaged in earning export income for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has already been an attack on public education by this government, with the latest fiasco of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) on literacy merely a symptom of this government's misguided approach. The opposition is very concerned that this legislation may further inhibit the legitimate activities of the educational sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some religious groups have also been very concerned about the potential impact of this bill. For example, the African Evangelical Fellowship of Australasia sends missionaries to Africa and the islands of the Indian Ocean, where they are engaged in a wide range of religious, humanitarian and social programs to assist the peoples of the region. This group has been operating for more than 100 years, providing vital assistance to underprivileged peoples. Fortunately, the government has amended the legislation to ensure that such important organisations are not disadvantaged, and we support this change of heart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Trustee Corporation of Australia&mdash;TCA&mdash;was also concerned about the potential impact of the legislation, from a different perspective: the impact on wills and on charitable bequests arising from wills. The TCA was concerned that the legislation might mean that many trusts would have to appear 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8301"> before the relevant state supreme courts in order to amend their terms to comply with the new regime. For example, amendments may have been needed to expressly prohibit overseas distributions. This would have been a potentially complex and expensive process and may have been more legally difficult than the government assumed. Again, fortunately, good sense prevailed. After this matter was raised by my colleague, the member for&mdash;ironically&mdash;Wills (Mr Gareth Evans), the government amended the bill to deal with these potentially large problems it was going to create. We are now happy to support these provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there is still one more area where the legislation is seriously deficient. That is the area of its effect on Australian charities which have made distributions since the commencement of this legislation&mdash;namely, since budget night on 26 August, 1996. There are two spectacular examples of the problem of drawing this anti&hyphen;avoidance net too wide. These are the Buckland Fund and Philanthropy Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia does not have the enormous private philanthropy sector enjoyed by the United States. However, both these charities have a significant history in the Australian context. The Buckland Fund was started in 1879 and has, since that time, been assisting ex&hyphen;employees of the Bank of New South Wales who have fallen on hard times and their dependents. Some of these people live overseas and have been paid assistance since 20 August last year. Hence, the fund is looking at losing its exemption permanently. There is no thought of tax avoidance; the problem is merely a government which does not pay proper attention to the impact of its proposals. Similarly, Philanthropy Australia, which is a major benefactor of other charities, is also unfairly threatened by the bill as currently drafted. I will return to these matters in greater detail at the committee stage, as the opposition will be moving some amendments to clear up the mess created by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of stopping the use of charitable and other trusts for tax avoidance brings me to the general issue of trusts and tax avoid 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ance. We all know that this is a very sensitive issue for the government. There is now widespread knowledge in the community that considerable leakage of revenue from the tax system arises through the use of trusts. In a speech to CEDA on 10 September, the Tax Commissioner, Mr Carmody, put the issue squarely in the Treasurer's court when he addressed the issue of the taxation treatment of trusts and whether the current arrangements were appropriate. Mr Carmody made the point that in some situations trusts can allow the tax&hyphen;free receipt by beneficiaries of profits which would have been taxable if they had been earned by companies and then distributed to shareholders. How can such a situation be fair and promote the efficient conduct of business?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been reports of one particular high&hyphen;wealth individual&mdash;which is code for a rich person&mdash;receiving a tax&hyphen;free amount of $19 million in just one year. How can such a system be supported when part&hyphen;time workers earning just over $100 a week have to pay income tax? Why is the government so reluctant to address the issue associated with the use of trusts? Why are we still waiting for the government's final legislation dealing with trafficking in trust losses?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor introduced legislation into the parliament in 1995 to deal with avoidance practices involving trust losses. The then opposition, now government, refused to pass these provisions and delayed the measures in a Senate committee until the election in 1996. Since then we have had two budgets which both announced further relaxation of Labor's fair proposals. It is only now that we have finally had this legislation introduced into the house&mdash;around two years after Labor's legislation was introduced. The reason for this unprecedented delay is pretty obvious. The issue is too difficult for the government because too many of those opposite have family trusts and hence have a conflict of interest in seeing the issue properly addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mike Seccombe in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> reported on 4 July 1997 that 13 of the government's 27 ministers had family trusts according to the official register of interests. So there is a real problem for the Treasurer 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8302"> (Mr Costello) if he wants to improve the fairness of the tax system. Half of his ministerial colleagues will presumably resist moves to increase the amount of tax that will be paid on their family income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax commissioner has clearly signalled the direction which he prefers: the comparable taxation of both companies and trusts. The response of the government to the review of the tax treatment of trusts will be a key indicator of whether the Howard government will simply be a re&hyphen;run of the Fraser government, which let tax avoidance get completely out of control, culminating in the infamous bottom of the harbour scandals. Or will it continue the outstanding efforts of the Hawke and Keating governments, which re&hyphen;introduced equity into the Australian tax system?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems of tax avoidance are perennial. Once one loophole is closed, the advisers move on to the next one. Governments can never relax in their task to keep the tax system fair. I can assure the Australian people that the Labor opposition will keep raising these vital issues to ensure that proper fairness is introduced into the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other minor matters in the bill that are not controversial and are supported by the opposition&mdash;namely, electronic lodgement of returns and electronic funds transfer; the new rules concerning group certificates for employees ceasing employment; the treatment of tax exempt entities that become taxable; and the rate of tax for friendly societies will be frozen at the current level of 33 per cent from 1997&hyphen;98 and 1998&hyphen;99 pending the outcome of a review of the proper taxation regime for the life insurance business and friendly societies. I would have liked to have spent some time explaining our position on each of these. Due to the interrupted nature of my address and the fact that the light is on and I am almost out of time, I cannot do that but I may seek the opportunity in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I commented at the commencement of my remarks&mdash;and let me wind up on this point&mdash;Labor does not oppose the principle of these measures, but we are concerned about some of the effects of the bill and we will be moving amendments to overcome those in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> committee stages. I think our amendments will address very serious problems.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="8302" TIME="11.18 a.m." SPEAKER="Margetts, Sen Dee" NAMEID="DX5" ELECTORATE="WA" PARTY="G(WA)" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(11.18 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the issue of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R280">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4)</XREF> , I will not be taking up much of the Senate's time. Basically the Greens (WA) find this bill fairly non&hyphen;contentious. The measures in it are designed to address various avenues for tax minimisation available to corporations and the rich but rarely available to ordinary people or businesses. Some of those avenues, such as the thin capitalisation treatment, were intentional. The government is now moving to reduce the possibility of such tax minimisation. Other measures arose due to clever accountants recognising how tax laws designed for other purposes could be manipulated to provide tax benefits. The issue of charitable trusts is such a case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are, in general, happy to support this bill, and I will flag now what we intend to do on amendments. We will support the government's amendments to change the dates to bring them more in line with the passage of this bill. We did have an initial concern that some charitable trusts established for legitimate charitable purposes may be affected. We are satisfied now that none that I know of will be detrimentally affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However I would like to say that I welcome ALP amendments Nos 3 and 4, which provide for a situation where, while the default is to pay tax, there are options for charitable trusts which are legitimate charitable organisations to ask for an exemption, and if examination shows that they are established for charitable purposes and not for tax minimisation, for them to be granted an exemption. If the tax office and the Treasurer can be satisfied that a charitable trust is established for a bona fide purpose, they should be able to make that exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we will not support ALP amendments Nos 1 and 2. These allow more `thin capitalisation' to occur in areas of low employment. While we are, of course, entirely sympathetic to the idea of doing something about the huge issue of rural and regional unemployment, I do not believe that this is a solution. Is creating a possibility for tax 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8303"> minimisation really a replacement for industry policy or systematic programs for regional development? Whilst I recognise that Labor has more industry policy suggestions than the coalition, it is obviously still not enough and it is not a replacement for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem of structural unemployment is in part a problem of the deregulation that allowed such power to reside with capital. I do not believe that the solution is to encourage investment by reducing the portion of profit that is returned to the community through taxation. We already know that, on average, companies and corporations in Australia pay less than a quarter of the tax revenue that ordinary citizens pay into the tax revenue. It is generally thought corporations hold Australia together in terms of providing for things like housing and health, but that is not the case. The average ordinary taxpayer pays in total&mdash;cumulative&mdash;over four times what companies pay in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, we believe that we should not be encouraging that proportion of profit to be reduced in terms of its tax contribution. The result is that profit, or capital, is maintained and concentrated in the hands of corporations. There is no guarantee that this will subsequently be spent, reinvested or retained in Australia. Of course, we know from the previous government that Mr Keating may have railed against companies for what they did or did not do but it is the case that, in the current situation, we are not necessarily getting that contribution back into the community. Investment requires capital&mdash;not wages, which do little other than cover expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the focus on attracting investment by reducing labour costs or taxation has been one of the factors driving the increase in structural unemployment, and that is because people are feeling less sure about where their next income is coming from. It may also be that more and more people in our society are joining the ranks of the working poor; that is, they do not have money to spend on goods and services above the necessities of life within their local community. That, in my belief, is one of the driving forces of structural unemployment, along with the concentra 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion on downsizing in services and large corporations which, I think, is to the detriment of those industries as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot support a measure which effectively does more of the same with less to look forward to. I think we should be looking at positive solutions rather than negative ones that simply support the situation we have seen up to now, where we are saying to corporations, `We will join in this race to the bottom' in terms of speculative investment and `We will offer you less wages and taxes to take over our existing companies.' I do not think that is the way we should be going. Instead of a continuation of slash and burn speculative investments, we should be looking at solid industry policy in Australia. We should become less dependent on investments flying out of the sky from multinationals overseas.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to limit myself by concentrating on one section of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R280">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4)</XREF> , and that is the measures to address tax avoidance through tax exempt entities distributing funds offshore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, as it relates to charities, proposes measures which were announced in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced that the government intended to introduce legislation to counter tax avoidance through the use of tax exempt bodies distributing funds offshore. When the exposure draft of this legislation was released, there was a great deal of concern from this sector; however, changes were made where possible to take account of those concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I want to speak on this bill is because, together with my staff, I have taken a very active role on behalf of the charitable sector in presenting their case to the Treasurer and Treasury officials. Those efforts have resulted in changes that the government has made to this bill.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put on record publicly my thanks to the Treasury officials for the very willing cooperation they gave me on this matter. They could not have done more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has made it very clear that any distribution of funds received from donations, gifts, offerings, `plate money' and donations of that nature will not affect an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8304"> organisation's tax exempt status. That has removed a most valid concern which was held by quite a number of organisations and churches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area of great concern was in relation to charitable trusts. In terms of charitable trusts, the government has taken the necessary steps to ensure that as far as possible bona fide organisations will not lose their tax exemption. The charitable trust sector is a very important sector operating under the philanthropic umbrella. Trust law at the best of times is complex, and it is very necessary that in taking steps to curb avoidance we do not at the same time make it unattractive for people to become involved in the provision of funding through this particular vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also makes it clear that organisations based in Australia will not be affected by the measures proposed as long as they incur their expenditure and pursue their objectives principally within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This clear statement of the intention of the legislation again should serve to allay the concerns of many organisations around the country who, in the course of their activities, undertake or are involved in some overseas work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is about stopping tax avoidance. It is not about curtailing the donation of moneys to overseas causes. It is about ensuring that the causes to which a trust donates are real and bona fide&mdash;causes that are recognised by this and other governments through section 78 of the tax act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having given those assurances, I will certainly be watching this legislation to ensure that its effect in practice washes over only those for whom the bill was intended. These elements are a small part of the philanthropic activity in Australia, an area which is very wide and in which we make a great national contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When people think of philanthropic activity they tend to think of the compassionate element&mdash;the relief of suffering, pain and distress in members of the community&mdash;and that, I think, is at the heart of philanthropic activity in Australia. But philanthropic activity 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> covers a much wider field now. It covers a great part of education, it covers the arts and it covers sports. Those last three elements are a larger part than the compassionate element of philanthropy which most people associate with the philanthropic sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The philanthropic sector is very important to Australia. As Rousseau said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compassion is a natural feeling which, by moderating the violence of love of self in each individual, contributes to the preservation of the whole species. It is this compassion that hurries us without reflection to the relief of those who are in distress.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Philanthropy is an area where we do make a great national effort, and very few people recognise the scale of the effort that Australians put into it. It is an industry that involves over $5 billion per year, and probably the major part of that&mdash;over 50 per cent&mdash;comes from governments at all levels, both directly through tax concessions for donations, wholesale sales tax exemptions and fringe benefits tax exemptions and indirectly in the form of rate concessions and other concessions by local governments. So the government does have a direct interest in the philanthropic sector as a donor, and it has a duty of care to those who support philanthropic activities in ensuring that funds play a worthwhile and effective role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have over 100,000 employees in the philanthropic sector in Australia, and Australians collectively contribute more than 95 million man&hyphen;hours of voluntary labour each year to philanthropic activities. From this, we derive very great social benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would argue that, for very small changes in the way we approach the philanthropic sector, we could get even greater benefits. I believe it is the one great area for social change that is open to Australia for the generation ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I am saying is that for the effort we make we could get better outcomes. To bring those about there are four simple things we need to do. We need to educate the community. We want to make it simple and easy for people to give either their time or their money. We want to reward or recognise those who are involved in philanthropic activities 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8305"> and we want to do as much as we can to have an assurance of value within the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is a responsibility of government to educate the community on the obligations they have to voluntarily support those who are less fortunate than themselves. That will fall on barren ground in some cases, but it is possible to get more people involved in philanthropic activities as a result of government persuasion in this matter. It can be quite pleasantly and honourably done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have got to make it much more simple and easy for people to give of their time and their money. We have got a huge legislative muddle out there. Over 70 pieces of Commonwealth legislation relate to charities alone. There are hundreds of pieces of state legislation relating to charities. A lot of those are in conflict. World Vision Australia some years ago estimated that it cost them a million dollars a year just in compliance costs coping with different state legislation in their fundraising. We have got the nonsense of capital gains tax. If I die and leave a million dollars to a charity, it is assumed that that gift was made before my death occurred and therefore that gift attracts capital gains tax. That will be taken out of the residue of my estate before it passes to whomever I leave my money to. That is clearly a counterincentive to people supporting charities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing we have got to do is recognise and reward those people. Not everyone wishes to be recognised or rewarded. Some people do like to work privately for charities, but most people like a pat on the back in some way. I am not saying we give them the Order of Australia or anything like that but there should be some public recognition of those who serve the community in a voluntary way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final thing we have got to do is have an assurance of effectiveness in the whole of the charitable sector. Most charitable organisations are extremely honest and if they were not honest they could not come back year after year and raise tens of millions of dollars from the public. The word would get out. But there are small operators in the field which are not endowed with great integrity and they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ought to be controlled and removed from the scene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, there is no qualification at all for anyone to go onto the market and raise money for a charity. You do not have to publish a prospectus; you do not have to say what you are going to do with the funds. Again, if you want to raise $2 million to build a ward at a hospital and you raise only $1&half; million, there is no obligation on the person raising that $1&half; million to pay that $1&half; million back because they cannot meet their target figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are no agreed auditing standards for charities and, except in the state of New South Wales, there is no legislation covering the overheads, how much money it costs to raise funds and what the residue going to philanthropic groups should be. So there is a great need for reform and streamlining of the legislative approach here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do need to try to develop efficiencies. Some charities are very efficient. Some regrettably are not, with the best will in the world. Other charities surprisingly are not even effective. They do not ever get around to doing what they set out to do. Again, most of them set out with the best will in the world but they do not get there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the problem of what the Americans call self&hyphen;inurement. If you have got a big charity that has a budget of $10, $20 or $30 million a year, the chief executive running that fund has got to be a very experienced and able person and they attract a high salary. But then the widow who is being appealed to, to give a donation of a dollar or $2 out of her pension for that fund, does not like the fact that a chief executive gets a salary of $100,000 or $200,000 a year. That is a matter that has got to be looked at and dealt with carefully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But to return to my original theme: the place of philanthropic activity in Australia is very large. It is not recognised by the country collectively for the size and the contribution it makes. I am not saying at all that we want to move away from the welfare programs that governments have. My belief is that, irrespective of the parties in government in Australia, the level of government welfare for the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8306"> community will by and large continue at the level that it is today. But by reforming the philanthropic sector we can deliver very great changes for the next generation for the benefit of the Australian community. It is something that we can do with minimal legislative change and minimal social dislocation. I believe the benefits that would come from that are really quite enormous. I see that this bill makes a contribution towards that path and that is why I wish it a speedy passage through the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator MURPHY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is amazing, Senator Cook, but in so far as the Greens are concerned it is even more amazing. But I will get to them shortly. What the amendment proposes to do is achieve something the government has been talking about doing although it has not done anything for some time. One of the reasons for this amendment is that the proposed bill in its current form would significantly affect a development in my own state. I will very clearly, up front, express that interest when saying where I am coming from. The project I talk about is Starwood, which is a medium density fibreboard plant which is yet to commence operation. It is a very significant investment on the part of a Japanese company known as Hokishan. It represents about $100 million of investment and will create a number of jobs in a region of Australia that has probably one of the highest levels of unemployment. Certainly it has one of the highest levels of unemployment in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment that we are proposing does not seek to remove or change the government's objective; rather it seeks to introduce 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it on a sliding scale, with a focus on areas of high unemployment. It says that, where unemployment is four per cent higher than the national seasonally adjusted average, the proposal for thin capitalisation&mdash;the reduction of three to one to two to one&mdash;would be phased in over a five-year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that that is totally consistent with what the government has been saying in recent times about industry development, getting industry moving and job creation. We know that we have an unemployment problem. The government has said, `We'll look at tax breaks, free trade zones, grants' and so on. The amendment that is proposed by us would have a minimal impact on the revenue that will be raised by this taxation measure&mdash;I understand it is around $70 million per annum&mdash;because only one project is likely to be affected, that is, the project that I have spoken about in my state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason it is important is that the MDF plant at Bell Bay is a two&hyphen;stage project&mdash;stage 1 is almost complete; indeed, it is due to be opened next month&mdash;and the second stage was based very much on the budget that was worked out prior to the changes to these laws. We had another battle not that long ago with another taxation measure. We found that the government had accepted what we proposed at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It meant a significant saving to this company, which has implemented and will be implementing ground&hyphen;breaking technology. It is a first in this country that MDF is proposed to be made from eucalypt. The technology is state-of-the-art. All of the product will be exported. It is one of those projects that goes very clearly to what the government is seeking to do. Yet the government does not seem to be prepared to support it in any way, shape or form. It makes a lot of noises about what it proposes to do and how it proposes to see industry develop, but there is very little on the action front.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, the amendment we are going to move will have an effect on this company. It may assist others around the country but it will assist only those in areas of very high unemployment. If you read the amendment and take on board its objective, you will see that it does have that focus. It is for areas of very high unemployment&mdash;where, as I have said, the unemployment level is four per cent above the national seasonally adjusted average, which in today's terms is around 12&half; per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Campbell, if you inquire of your own offices in various departments, they will be able to tell you that there is not a huge plethora of developments proposed or being built for operation that this amendment will affect and therefore have some serious effect on the income measures in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not necessarily have any argument about what the government is intending to do about thin capitalisation. But given all the noises that the government has made over 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> time about trying to address the unemployment problem, saying, `We are going to look at tax breaks, free trade zones and grants' et cetera, I would have thought that the opposition amendment is totally consistent with what it has been saying. Senator Campbell, here is your opportunity to put your hand up and say, `Yes, we are prepared to do something in areas of high unemployment, and we are prepared to do something that will assist projects that are totally export orientated.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">George Town, in my home state, has an unemployment rate of 20 per cent. It has one of the lowest participation rates in the country. It is of serious concern to me and to other Tasmanians, including the Liberal Premier, who has written to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) about this. I urge the government to rethink its position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I find even more amazing is the position of the Greens and the Democrats. The Democrats generally have taken an approach of being interventionist. Again, here is their opportunity to intervene and do something in the interests of the very high areas of unemployment in my state and in other areas. Here is an opportunity for them to see money, in terms of tax breaks, et cetera, that will be driven by unemployment&mdash;the high levels of unemployment. In regional Australia&mdash;the people that they say they stand up for no end&mdash;it seems that they are going to fall over it before they even get to the barrier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard the Greens both in Tasmania and in this place making noises about downstream processing, saying that they want industry development to have a plantation based focus so that we over time remove the necessity to use native forests. Here is a chance for them to support a development that is headed that way. It is one development that they ought to be totally behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet Senator Margetts, in her contribution, said, `Oh, no. We're not going to support it&mdash;no way.' I hope Senator Brown might be able to convince his colleague to do otherwise. Otherwise, I hope Senator Brown can explain to the Tasmanian public, particularly those in the area of George Town, why, on the one hand, they make noises about supporting 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8308"> industry development and downstream processing and then stand up in the Senate and vote against them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though I am probably being a little parochial in so far as development in my own state is concerned, I do hope the government will consider this. I would be interested to hear from the government what they think the financial impact of this amendment would be. My view would be that it would be very low, yet the benefit from the development in Tasmania will be very high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I urge the government to consider this amendment very seriously. I hope that they may be able to change their mind and allow this to proceed because it is of fundamental importance. If the government are to at least demonstrate to the Australian public that all of the statements that they have made with regard to industry development and dealing with unemployment are to be believed, or at least partially believed, then they will support our amendment and allow for some opportunity to give some focus to industry development in areas of high unemployment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, no; I would not embarrass them that way. Now that I have a little bit on the record, that is enough. However, let me turn to the matter before the chair. The amendment the opposition has moved is a pro rural and regional employment amendment. After two Costello budgets that have ripped the financial heart and soul out of rural and regional Australia, it is once again left to the opposition to try to provide an incentive to invest in rural and regional Australia and therefore to create jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is not opposed to the general thrust of this proposal which seeks to reduce the foreign debt to foreign equity ratio, which currently stands at three to one. This bill reduces it to two to one. We agree with the government that in essence this is an anti&hyphen;avoidance measure. But, as is usual with the government, in their haste to close down the exploitation of the current tax law they have opened up unintended consequences. One of these unintended consequences is to now penalise companies that have already begun 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> investing in Australia and in particular in rural and regional Australia, which are the main areas of high unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment will seek to allow companies that invest in areas of high unemployment access to the more concessional debt to equity ratio based upon a sliding scale. For the 1997-98 financial year the ratio would remain, in my amendment, at three to one, moving to 2.8 to one for the 1998-99 financial year and so on until the year 2002&hyphen;03, when the foreign debt to foreign equity ratio will be two to one for all foreign investors. That is the two to one that is embodied in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The qualification test for the concessional treatment will be whether the geographical area of investment is a high unemployment area. The test for this will be the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the labour force region in question plus four per cent. So, if an applicant fails to meet this test, they will face the two to one ratio immediately, as is intended by this bill. As there are 120 ABS labour force regions in Australia, this means that on average a qualifying region would contain between 120,000 and 150,000 people, roughly speaking. Given that in the September quarter the reported seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 8.7 per cent, only areas of 12.7 per cent or more would qualify under Labor's proposal if an investment were to be made tomorrow.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8310">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I therefore put to the Senate, and the government in particular: do they believe that an area that has an unemployment rate approaching 13 per cent should not be assisted by this measure, as minor as it is? I also ask the National Party: do they believe that rural and regional areas of Australia, many of which they represent, where there is unemployment of 13 per cent or more do not deserve some form of minor assistance through this tax initiative that this amendment seeks to introduce?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second reading debate we heard from my colleague Senator Murphy, who spoke more specifically about this matter. The particular instance was a $90 million investment in a wood processing mill which is now at risk in northern Tasmania due to the government's haste or inadvertence. The unemployment figure in that region where this investment is at risk is close to 15 per cent. Shouldn't we do something in some small way by seeking to encourage such investments in high areas of unemployment? Are the government serious about assisting rural and regional Australia, or will we get just more rhetoric from the government that they are great supporters of regional and rural Australia? I say to the government: support your rhetoric with action and support Labor's amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make a particular entreaty to the Greens, the Democrats and the Independent members in this chamber to see this as a way in which we can merge towards the principle that we all support in terms of the ratio being reduced from three to one to two to one, but quarantine from that overnight change areas of high unemployment in Australia so that the reduction is slower and so that major investments of the sort that Senator Murphy has referred to which will create jobs for people in those regions can go through and give them a chance to look forward to work opportunities. I do support very strongly what Senator Murphy said about the particular project in northern Tasmania that he referred to.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me not be diverted by this. Let me get back to the issue. Here is a $90 million project in an area of unemployment in excess of 15 per cent and where my amendment will help that investment go ahead and create some hope for those people in this region. That is a laudable thing. As I was saying, when you actually look at the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8311"> type of project this is, you see that it takes materials that would not otherwise be used and turns them into a product which can be used for housing construction. So that is in itself the best use of resource. This is an investment to add value to a basic material and therefore get a higher return to the nation because of the value adding process. It is primarily for export, so it will earn export dollars as well. That is a commendable example of what this amendment would do, and I seek the support of the chamber on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been some interjections during my remarks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook has accused us of acting in haste to close down a tax avoidance loophole, a loophole that Senator Cook knows favours foreign companies and advantages them over Australian companies. If we stand accused of acting in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> haste to close down tax loopholes, we plead guilty. In relation to the interjections, we are not set to draw a distinction between this amendment and accept the validity of this amendment versus the action in relation to Wesley Vale. Senator Cook, in his contribution in the committee stage debate, put forward an argument that would have been eloquent and convincing in the series of cabinet meetings that discussed Wesley Vale. I think former Senator Peter Walsh outlined those cabinet meetings in his recollection of them. If I have accused him wrongly of detailing the processes that surrounded those cabinet meetings, then I apologise in advance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook's was an eloquent speech in favour of the decision to proceed with the Wesley Vale pulp mill in the late 1980s. From what I know of Senator Cook I suspect he made a similar sort of speech in that cabinet meeting. It was an eloquent speech and a sound argument for proceeding with that project in terms of downstream processing, using resources and creating jobs in Tasmania. It certainly supports the amendment moved by Labor in relation to changing the thin capitalisation measures. However, the government believes that there are a number of significant problems with it. I will outline those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, our legal advice is that the measure would be constitutionally invalid because it would discriminate between labour force regions in the various states. Of equal weight in the government's mind is that it would create further opportunities for tax avoidance. So in other words, you put this measure in and you open this gate for access to special thin capitalisation measures for foreign companies. But as you open that gate, you allow other people through it. To give you an example through you, Madam Temporary Chairman, for Senator Murphy's benefit and Senator Cook's benefit, it would be quite easy for a company to arrange to earn some of its income in a labour force region of high unemployment without being physically located in that area. This would enable such companies to continue to avoid paying their fair share of Australian tax for at least the next five years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, can I go to what Senator Campbell seems to be pursuing. He says: `You did not support Wesley Vale.' Senator Campbell, I do not know how much you know about Wesley Vale, but I would think not a great deal. I do not expect that you would need know to great deal about it, but I say for your benefit that this is a totally different issue. The issue surrounding the development of the Wesley Vale pulp mill&mdash;and there were many, but one of the principal ones&mdash;involved environmental concerns, to do with the effluent and outflow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A process was put in place by the then government to resolve those issues but that was in no way the thing that undid the development of the Wesley Vale pulp mill. If you went into the detail you might find that one of the key factors that impacted on the Wesley Vale pulp mill not proceeding was a number of decisions taken by one of the major partners involved in that proposed development. It had nothing do with the government at the end of the day. Sure, the government took some steps to ensure that the environmental controls with respect to effluent and outflow were in line with world's best practice&mdash;in hindsight the right decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other major difference with regard to the project that this amendment is primarily intended to assist is that the wood proposed to be used will ultimately be plantation based wood. The Wesley Vale pulp mill development would have seen an increase in the use of native forest hardwood. It is not that I was opposed to that. It was one of the major concerns, but it was not one that I necessarily opposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important factor is that this is totally export oriented&mdash;totally. None of this product will be sold within Australia. Moreover, it is a development that proposes one of the best downstream processing models. It uses low grade wood and turns it into a very high quality product&mdash;a product that is still seeing high degrees of development. That development will continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought any government, and any Democrat senator, who is interested in industry development would like to support 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> such development. Senator Campbell, I do not accept what you are saying with regard to `legally invalid constitutionally'. Nor do I accept your argument that a company could proceed. If they are the problems, then I am sure that this amendment could be further modified to take account of those difficulties. If they are the two things that you see as being reasons for not supporting this amendment, then I am sure they can be overcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big question for you, Senator Campbell, and the government is this: whether or not you support development of industries in regions of Australia where there is high unemployment. That is the big question. The government has made many noises on this issue, but it does not seem prepared to follow them up with action. So that is where you are at. If you think there are a couple of problems with our amendment, I am sure that they can be attended to and, if need be, we can take some time to address that and then bring the amendment back. But, as I have said, the big question for you, Senator Campbell, and the government is this: whether or not you are prepared to support areas where there is really high unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will make just one point about George Town and the George Town area. According to the 1996 census figures, unemployment in the George Town area was 20.9 per cent; the participation rate was 33&half; per cent. That is a very serious problem. We have also had the closure of a couple of other processing plants there, one which related to aluminium wheels. Those figures are likely to be worse now. We have also lost around 170 jobs at a plant called Southern Aluminium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We desperately need assistance in Tasmania. I again remind you, Senator Campbell, and other government senators that it was your government that made a very clear statement and commitment to Tasmania: you would do whatever you could to assist our state&mdash;the state with the highest unemployment of any state or territory in Australia&mdash;and take whatever steps you could.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is but one small step that the government can take. I hope&mdash;just as I hope Senator Murray might see fit also to encourage&mdash;that such a step will be taken to support industry 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8313"> development in my state and specifically in a region of my state that is suffering very badly.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Three issues arise as a result of Labor's amendment. The first issue is that of regional development. The second issue is that of unemployment. And the third issue is that of the specific needs of northern Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we deal with regional development first, it was our great regret as Australian Democrats&mdash;and I think a regret shared by most of the non-government parties in this chamber&mdash;that the 1996 budget, known as Treasurer Costello's budget, colloquially now known as the `slash and burn budget', hammered funds for regional development. In fact, my memory recalls that something like $160 million was withdrawn from that budget, and numerous and very effective offices were closed as a result. I am hopeful that, having learned the lessons of a scorched earth policy, the government's new reorganisation of its ministry will, in fact, contribute to recovering some ground in that area.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3M6">Senator MURRAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, they have put local government, territories and regional development together. So, regardless of where you stand with politics in this chamber, I think it is in the interests of Australia that its rural, remote and regional areas have special attention given to their advancement, in terms of both traditional rural pursuits and industrial development, where appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think our great concern with the government and regional development is that there is still no plan, no vision, no sense of direction. I do hope that, as it progresses in its term, the government will begin to advance plans in that area which will win back some of the losses consequent to policy and budget cuts. The first thing we have to say is that any tax assistance to regional development issues which advance the cause of regional development in a positive sense would, in principle, be welcomed not only by us but I am sure by every party in the chamber.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue&mdash;and the first and second issues are not necessarily the same&mdash;is that of unemployment. Senators would be aware that there are regional areas where there is no unemployment&mdash;and thank goodness for that. One of the ones I know of is the Barossa Valley. I am not sure that there are too many others. But I do know that, in the Barossa Valley, there is always a shortage of workers if actual work needs to be done. It is one of those lucky areas, quite frankly, which does better than much of regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As opposition senators have rightly pointed out, it is more common than not that the unemployment rate on average in regional Australia is worse in many respects than the average for the country as a whole. Once again, the useful focus provided by the Labor Party amendment is that it says, `Look, you need to provoke tax devices which pay attention to advancing the cause of lowering unemployment.' It does not mean that if you are unemployed in a region of only four of five per cent unemployment it does not matter as much as it would if you were in a region of 20 per cent unemployment. If you are unemployed, it hurts. But it is the case that the community can cope with a lower percentage of unemployment better than with a high level of unemployment in the double figures. Again, in principle, it is our belief that we should focus on unemployment levels which are higher than the country's average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point that I want to make is relevant to the needs of northern Tasmania. It seems inappropriate to me to advance a major change in tax recommendations and tax policy for the sake of one company. It concerns me that this particular policy&mdash;which has some substance intellectually speaking and therefore should generate some support&mdash;is driven by the needs of looking after one company. I am not sure that it is right to change the tax policy for Australia as a whole when one company has a particular need, even if it might be a good case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a minor change. If it were a minor change, nobody would care, but this is a major change. I would have preferred Labor to have put forward an amendment which asks the government to look at the relation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8314"> ship between regional development, tax incentives and unemployment and then come back to us with a report detailing their opinion on the most appropriate way to drive industry development in the regions and to lower unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook, you know where my heart is with this stuff. I am supportive of your general intention, but I am not sure that this is the appropriate vehicle or method in which to drive it. If it is driven by one company's needs, however good that case may or may not be, I find it difficult to support it, because it offends the general principle of how tax legislation should be dealt with. Accordingly, I will not support your amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.18 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a few words in a final effort to persuade senators to accept this amendment. The argument put by the government falls into two categories. The first one is: what did you do in Wesley Vale? That argument is a red herring, and I have dealt with it before. In any case, I think that Senator Murphy dealt with it more extensively. What I did in cabinet is a matter of cabinet confidentiality, but my conscience is absolutely clear on these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other argument put by the government is whether or not our amendment is constitutional. This is an argument that gets trotted out every now and again when there is nothing else to say. It radiates the sense that maybe you are treading on very dangerous legal grounds. I am not at all persuaded on this occasion that what we are doing is anything close to unconstitutional at all. I am not a constitutional lawyer, and that ought to be taken into account, but my clear understanding of the constitution is that you cannot discriminate between states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment looks at areas of Australia where there is high unemployment. Maybe there would be a constitutional argument if all of the regional areas of high unemployment in Australia were in one state. Someone might hold, therefore, that it was discrimination positively in favour of a particular state, but senators in this chamber know that high levels of unemployment occur in regions throughout Australia and in many states of Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure whether there are high levels of unemployment in all states, but I suspect there are. Therefore, you could put that this provision is analogous to the tax zone rebates provisions: where those zones take up particular regions of Australia and are regarded as constitutional. I think that is the appropriate analogy here. Ergo, I regard that the regions that we would identify here would also be constitutional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bear in mind that their identification is a moving target. The effect of my amendment would be that, if those regions fell below the level of four per cent above the average of unemployment, the change sought by the government would immediately apply. If the amendment worked to the extent that it attracted investment in those regions which reduced unemployment, the effect would be that the bill in its present form would apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this battle against unemployment there is no simple and easy solution, and all ideas should be boldly tried. I wonder whether Warwick Smith, the member for Bass, has considered in detail what his constituents in George Town face with an unconscionably high level of unemployment in that area. I wonder whether he would have voted for this amendment or whether he would have been locked up by the government and voted against it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I am making is that, if it does attract investment, the government gets its bill and unemployment is lower. That is a win-win outcome for everyone. If it does not attract investment, then it phases down and eventually the government will get the full weight of its current legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third argument raised in this debate came from a quarter which I always have great regard for and pay great attention to. It came from Senator Andrew Murray of the Australian Democrats. Senator Murray is a knowledgeable person in this field so one would be wise to listen carefully to what he has said. I understood, though, that what Senator Murray is saying on this occasion is that he feels constrained not to support our amendment because it looks shamelessly like a way in which you can support one company&mdash;those are my words, not his. If that is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8315"> the proposition, can I say that that is not the intention of the opposition at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have used a graphic example of where this would apply, and it therefore appears that there is just one case, and only one case. I have not been able to be exhaustive and look at all other areas where unemployment would be four per cent above the mean but I am sure that if we were to do that exhaustively there would be many other areas too where this could apply, and not necessarily in the type of industry that we are talking about here in northern Tasmania but in other sorts of industries that have a rural connection. What springs to mind immediately are some areas where there is some old mining activity. The mines are running out and the future for those regions is bleak. There are other downstream processing possibilities in mine site reclamation, stockpile review or slagheap re&hyphen;filtering that could create further employment and, who knows, this may follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, to the third argument: it may look as though it is supporting one company in one given area but I remind the Senate that this applies to all areas of high unemployment in regional Australia and I do think there would be other cases in which other companies would be interested in taking advantage of what is after all a very small loophole, a very small change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that we support the principle at play here. We have said that all along. In fact, I think we said it first and sought to close off this principle first. So we are not here saying that we do not believe that tax avoidance should somehow be curtailed, nor are we here able to be accused of supporting tax avoidance. We are on the record clearly about that right from day one and have been consistent about it. But in the closing&hyphen;off of this loophole, and balancing that against the other evil of high unemployment in regional Australia, we think there is a phasing mechanism that can apply that will create a win&hyphen;win outcome. It is for that reason I commend the amendment to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats recognise the problem inherent in the government's original proposal for charitable trusts. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No 4) 1997, as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8317"> introduced into the House, had the potential to prevent funds being distributed overseas, even for missionary or aid purposes. The government corrected this in the House of Representatives but has acknowledged that some trusts might still be picked up. The concern was that the spill would apply from budget night on 22 August 1996, but the draft legislation was not produced until some months later and not introduced into the parliament until June, 1997.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, a number of charitable trusts have apparently distributed funds offshore, without realising or appreciating that such an action would result in their losing tax exempt status. The Democrats have had discussion with the government on this issue and informed the government that we believe the August operative date is unfair and that the bill should rather apply from the beginning of this financial year. The government has now brought that forward as a formal amendment, and I want to record the thanks of the Australian Democrats to the government for taking that action and for correcting weaknesses in the bill. We will be supporting the government amendments fully and, therefore, we would expect Senator Cook's amendment to fall away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should point out that a trust does not lose tax exempt status for distributing donations. These measures apply only to income earned by a trust which would otherwise have been assessable. When charitable trusts become aware that distributions overseas can still be made out of donated money, I think that this measure will not occasion some of the concern that it might have occasioned at first glance. The government's bill is, by and large, a very welcome bill. It is a well&hyphen;conceived piece of legislation, and your ability to listen to concerns and to correct weaknesses and inadequacies is to your credit. I thank you for it. </PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I would like to discuss as a matter of public interest the issue of banking&mdash;the services banks provide and the community reaction to those services. Of particular interest is the issue of increased bank profits, market share and banks' convergent service delivery to their customers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting some useful figures in regard to banks before I go any further. On average, Australian banks have earned a return of 16&half; per cent on shareholder equity over the last financial year. This is a considerable increase, and it is highlighted by the fact that the all ordinaries index in the same period showed an increase of 11 per cent. Additionally, the four major banks&mdash;National Australia Bank, Westpac, ANZ and the Commonwealth&mdash;averaged a 16.7 per cent return. Profit after tax in the same period increased by 20.7 per cent. Major banks increased their assets by 13.4 per cent; regionals by 14.7 per cent; and other banks by almost 20 per cent. These figures clearly indicate that the banking sector has managed itself particularly well over the last several financial years and that the banks are enjoying the fruits of their endeavours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one would begrudge the banking sector this high level of performance and reward. However it is incumbent upon us as legislators to monitor these institutions, which provide an integral service to society, and to ensure that consumers are protected and operating within a market that is competitive and provides a range of options. It is within this framework that I seek to make my comments today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of most significance in the recent debate regarding banking has been the Wallis inquiry. I would like to take the opportunity to make some comments on this inquiry and the impact it will have on banks and, indeed, consumers. It is worth stating from the outset that, while the Labor Party is opposed to a number of recommendations in the Wallis inquiry report and the government's response, overall it recognises the significant and useful contribution made to banking reform by that inquiry. The Wallis inquiry has made a firm 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8319"> contribution to further reform of the banking and finance sector. It must be said, however, that it further complements the Campbell report of 1981 and that it makes improvements rather than being a major reform document in its own right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wallis report makes a number of recommendations that are supported by the opposition. Most importantly, the ALP supports the creation of a new regulatory framework to monitor and regulate the expansion of product and service conversion. Prior to the impact of deregulation in the 1980s, life offices, banks, superannuation funds and insurers operated in separate and distinct markets. Now, after a decade of reform and deregulation, product conversion between institutions has increased and blurred the lines of past differentiation. This trend will only continue into the future, probably further complicating the market, information and advice available to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is why the Labor Party supports the creation of a new regulatory framework. This new framework should be designed to focus on two fundamental areas: consumer protection and prudential supervision. Importantly, the Labor Party does not support the proposal by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to merge these two areas of regulation into the one regulatory body. In regard to prudential supervision, the Wallis report recommends the establishment of a new body called the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. This new body would acquire many of the functions currently performed by the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and the financial institutions scheme. Amongst a number of aims, this body would bring all institutions accepting deposits under the one regulatory regime. Primarily, this would work to bring about a more level playing field between banks, building societies and credit unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Based on evidence to the inquiry, there are a number of reforms that are still required in the already much reformed state regulatory bodies for credit unions and building societies. The new APRA would set in motion the plan to bring all institutions under the one national plan rather than differing regional 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> plans. Considered important by the opposition, and indeed by most observers, the Reserve Bank would maintain responsibility for overseeing the financial and banking system as a whole and ensuring stability. Therefore a sound working relationship between the Reserve Bank and the new regulatory body would be necessary and, indeed, essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP views the Reserve Bank's continued involvement in this area of the banking and financial sector as both crucial and critical to overall industry stability. One of the most important aspects of prudential supervision is the application of consistent depositor protector arrangements to all deposit&hyphen;taking institutions. This is of increased importance when consideration is given to the number of bank branches closing down in rural Australia and their replacement in the market by credit unions and building societies. The ALP recognises the need for some legislative amendment to ensure this change takes place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A similar structure is required for reform in the area of consumer protection. The Wallis report makes such a recommendation. Once again, there are a range of institutions that monitor differing consumer concerns in all the states and territories. This fragmentation can lead to great inefficiencies and duplication. It makes sense for a national approach to be taken. The ALP, however, does not believe that the new consumer body should exist at the expense of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The ALP believes that the ACCC should continue to be funded as an economy-wide regulator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An area of particular concern in regard to consumer protection is bank fees and charges. The government, in particular the Treasurer, whom I am about to quote, supports the Wallis inquiry recommendation that financial institutions be able to act with freedom in regard to fees and charges `without government intervention or persuasion.' The ALP disagrees with this unfettered approach to fees and charges. The opposition has consistently called for support of the Prices and Surveillance Authority's 1995 report that recommended a formal monitoring of bank fees and charges by the ACCC.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8320">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, in attempting to sell interest rate cuts as entirely of its doing, has completely ignored the emerging public concern regarding bank fees and charges. With bank profits from home mortgages being squeezed as a result of lower interest rates, banks are focusing on fees and charges as a way of recouping some of that reduced earnings. The Liberal government is assisting banks to do this. The Treasurer believes that informal monitoring of bank fees and charges will suffice, due to the large amount of information available to consumers in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) pointed out in the House, this high level of material does not always equate to a high level of consumer knowledge. He quoted Dr David Cousins, the former head of the PSA, in a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . even he finds it difficult to get consistent information on fees and charges which he can understand. The lack of authoritative, readily available and easy to understand information on the array of fees and charges in the marketplace today is a major market failure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This illustration of concern is an example of why the government needs to establish a formal regulatory body to monitor fees and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area of major differentiation between Wallis and the ALP is the so&hyphen;called four&hyphen;pillars policy. The Treasurer has failed to make any comment with regard to this issue, and one can only conclude that his silence highlights consent for the Wallis report recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The four&hyphen;pillars policy recognises that, while a large degree of deregulation has occurred, there is still a high level of concentration in the Australian marketplace. The four&hyphen;pillars policy of the ALP prevented any two of the four major Australian banks from merging and thus increasing concentration of the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In holding this position, the ALP believes that the four&hyphen;pillars policy has contributed to greater competitiveness within the market. A shift away from the four&hyphen;pillars policy would have an impact on that competitiveness.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own mind, the ALP's concerns regarding the government's response to the Wallis inquiry were crystallised by a recent survey I conducted in my home state of Western Australia. The survey group comprised some 500 constituents, 22 per cent of whom responded in written form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In general, the questionnaire identified the following concerns: increasingly high fees and charges, lack of customer service that has resulted from expenditure cuts within banks, low levels of interest earned on savings accounts while customers are paying high levels of interest on borrowed money or credit and the closure of branches. In addition to these main concerns, the amount of time taken by banks to clear cheques was also identified as a major issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Respondents were aggrieved that it took five working days for cheques to be cleared. This was seen solely as a way for the banks to earn interest on customers' money. Respondents thought the delay even more bewildering when tax cheques from the government were involved. Few thought there was any likelihood of a bank cheque bouncing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These comments and the government's response to a range of issues raised by the Wallis inquiry identify the gap that exists in attitude between the government and the community. This is particularly true regarding fees and charges. As I previously mentioned, the government supports ever&hyphen;increasing bank fees and charges while the Labor Party and the community support monitoring of these fees and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In responses to the questionnaire, 87 per cent of respondents stated that bank fees and charges were too high. In addition, 91 per cent supported the Labor Party's calls for a monitoring service of bank fees and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not, however, all bad news for the banks. For example, in the area of electronic banking, 62 per cent of respondents said that electronic banking had improved their banking service. Sixty&hyphen;three per cent of respondents did note, however, that when electronic banking was not available, general standards of customer service did not improve.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8321">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The questionnaire also provided space for general comments. It is worth noting that 79 per cent of those general comments related directly to increased fees and charges, and a further 11 per cent tied the issue of increased fees and charges with a declining quality of service. Clearly, fees and charges are of considerable concern to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conclusion from the Wallis report, the government's response and public reaction is that large&hyphen;scale reforms in the banking and finance sector have resulted in a significant degree of dissatisfaction with a range of bank services. However, equally obvious is the fact that the banking and finance sectors are likely to continue to reform, advance and change over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This, amongst other things, is a result of the impact of technological change in the industry affecting both service and employment. When this technological change is considered in addition to the continual path of globalisation, reforms must be accepted but also adapted to meet consumer demands. Already, this reform is obvious. The Wallis report identified some 1,760 differentiated mortgage packages and 1,800 deposit products since Labor introduced deregulation in the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even more obvious is the fact that, at the end of the day, the banking and finance sectors are profit driven. They are beholden to shareholders and must act in their best interests at all times. This means, of course, profits and dividends. If banks are experiencing decreasing profits due to increased mortgage competition, they will obviously look elsewhere to improve their bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be argued that the responsibility to consider the impact of this profit driven approach on consumers is of no concern to the banks unless that performance hinders profits. The same argument, however, cannot be made for government. It is the responsibility of governments to consider the impact of this approach on consumers, with particular regard to low deposit consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that reforms will continue. The role of government is not to pick a side in the reforms but rather to manage them so that banks are able to fulfil their duties to their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shareholders and provide an acceptable level of service to their customers.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8321"><TITLE>Domestic Violence and Drunkenness</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise, as a matter of public importance, domestic violence and drunkenness and whether self&hyphen;induced intoxication should be available as a legal defence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent decision by the ACT magistrate, Shane Madden, to acquit Canberra Raiders rugby league player Noa Nadruku of two assault charges has not only provoked community outrage, it has also raised some important legal and social issues for federal, state and territory governments and for local communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Irrespective of one's views on the outcome, the presiding magistrate correctly applied the law as it stands in the ACT. In Nadruku's case, the established facts were that, on 22 February, Nadruku consumed 28 schooners of beer, six stubbies and half a bottle of wine. He then assaulted his wife and two other women who were total strangers. His wife actually refrained from pressing charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the ACT, where Nadruku appeared in court, a defence available to him was that he was so drunk he could not have formed an intent to commit the offences. The important legal question that arises is whether voluntary intoxication should continue to be a legal defence in such circumstances, as still exists in some state and territory jurisdictions across Australia. The community response to this question would undoubtedly be no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is more than this one legal issue to overcome if Australian jurisdictions are to have a common standard making adults legally responsible for self&hyphen;induced intoxication that leads to committing a criminal act. The High Court in O'Connor v. the Queen held in 1980 that evidence of intoxication was admissible to raise a doubt about whether the defendant was capable of forming an intent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of voluntary intoxication raises difficult questions. In legal terms, since gross intoxication may affect a person's ability to form an intent at the time of the offence, evidence of intoxication can be raised as a defence. The so-called `drunks defence' 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8322"> is that a person was so intoxicated, he or she did not know what he or she was doing and could not have formed an intent to commit the offence. Often this creates a dent in the prosecution's case, which needs to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that both the act of the crime and the mental element or the intent of the crime were present. Not all intoxicated offenders will necessarily be able to rely on this defence. Only the most grossly intoxicated are likely to succeed in establishing that they were incapable of intending the consequences of their actions. But it is often in these circumstances that the crimes committed are the most horrific.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Traditionally, legal principles relating to intoxication as a defence have not been applied consistently by the courts. In the United Kingdom, the House of Lords settled the matter in 1978 in the case of the Queen v. Majewski, where it was held on public policy grounds that intoxication should not be admissible as evidence to raise a doubt as to the existence of an accused's mental state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court of Australia rejected this view in the past on the basis that it violated a fundamental legal principle regarding capacity to form an intent. This past stance led to the High Court being accused of creating `rights for drunks'. According to a 1986 Victorian Law Reform Commission Report, however, the common law intoxication defence has been successfully raised in only a negligible number of cases in the 18 years since O'Connor was decided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995 the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General prepared a Model Criminal Code which attempted to standardise criminal laws throughout Australia. With respect to principles of criminal responsibility, the O'Connor rule on intoxication was rejected and the Majewski rule was preferred. These principles have since been enacted by the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996 an amendment to the New South Wales Crimes Act inserted provisions dealing with voluntary intoxication along the lines of the Criminal Code Act. It is, however, a matter of some concern that the common law relating to intoxication, as stated in O'Connor, still applies in the ACT, Victoria and South 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia. The New South Wales position also remains problematic. Intoxication is held to be irrelevant to crimes of basic intent but relevant to crimes of specific intent. The potential for inconsistency is still present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Writing on this topic in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, law lecturer Kumar Amirthalingam suggested that the recommendations of the 1975 Butler committee warrant consideration and further examination. The Butler report basically proposed the creation of a new offence of culpable intoxication, which is not intended to criminalise drinking but is a method of enforcing individual responsibility for self-induced irresponsible behaviour out of step with community thinking on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the wake of this most recent incident, the ACT Attorney-General, Mr Gary Humphries, said that the territory will review the law allowing a defendant to be acquitted on the basis of being too drunk to form an intent to commit a crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Nadruku case has since been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The licence of the Canberra premises where Nadruku was drinking was also being examined and Nadruku himself has been driven out of the Canberra Raiders. Is this overkill? Should the community bear some greater responsibility for approving of a culture where drinking oneself into a stupor is one of the rights of passage to mateship? It is difficult to enter a pub anywhere in Australia without hearing the topic of football. The cultural nexus between football and alcohol is more than incidental.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most recent court case certainly sends mixed messages to young people, where more than 60 per cent of drug related deaths among young people are actually related to alcohol. The case also undermines the confidence that Australians, particularly women, have in the protection afforded by the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Canberra Raiders club has been portrayed as taking a firm stand against violence towards women in the absence of a more definitive court ruling, by terminating Nadruku's contract on the grounds of damaging the club's family oriented reputation and bringing the game into disrepute. The club's response to Nadruku was curious. Firstly, it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8323"> raises the question as to the timeliness of justice, given that the determination was called for eight months after the drinking binge and the end of the 1997 football season, and after Nadruku had, in fact, been acquitted. Secondly, it raises questions about the appropriateness of institutions other than courts&mdash;societal disapproval, if you will&mdash;dispensing justice or retribution outside the legal system. However reprehensible his actions, is it appropriate that he should be subjected to trial by the community following his acquittal at law?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But more than anything else, the court decision undermines the fight for widespread acknowledgment of the fact that alcohol is no excuse for violent behaviour. When alcohol is often the cause or trigger for a huge proportion of domestic violence cases and general assaults against women, the law must step in to correct existing anomalies that relieve an offender of personal responsibility for deliberately irresponsible conduct. There is ample evidence to suggest that other spouses feel the same way as Nadruku's wife, Kolora Kurimalawai, who said that she was often scared when her husband went out drinking with the boys.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst there is no national database on the incidence and patterns of family abuse, the available data does indicate that family violence is a grim reality in Australia comparable to the scale of family violence in the United States and Canada. A 1995-96 parliamentary research paper indicated that up to five per cent of men and 22 per cent of women may experience spousal assault each year. The monetary cost of violence against women is estimated to be about $1.5 billion annually in New South Wales alone. Costs include medical treatment, income support, special accommodation, lost productivity and legal services. The mental and emotional costs are immeasurable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A 1996 ABS report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Women's Safety Australia</EMPHASIS>, indicates that almost half a million Australian women experienced either physical or sexual violence in the year preceding the survey. Twenty-three per cent of women who have been married or are in a de facto relationship experienced violence at some stage 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> during the relationship. More women experience physical violence from a current or previous partner than from a stranger. In the previous 12 months, in the vicinity of 104,000 women experienced physical violence by their current partner, 75,000 by a previous partner and 67,000 by a stranger. Thirty-eight per cent of women who experienced violence by a current partner said their children had witnessed the incident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the survey, more than half of all women who experience violence tell only their family and friends. Only 19 per cent of women who were physically assaulted and 15 per cent of women who were sexually assaulted in the last 12 months reported the incident to the police. Even fewer women used crisis and other services after being assaulted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main reasons that women gave for not telling the police were that they felt they wanted to deal with the incident themselves or they did not regard it as serious enough. A further 12 per cent of those who were sexually assaulted said that they did not report the incident to the police because they were ashamed or embarrassed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government is serious about addressing the issue of domestic violence and violence against women. Today the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) will advise all states and territories that he will raise the issue of intoxication as a legal defence at the next Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and call for its abolition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the SCAG meeting in December the Attorney-General will ask the Victorian, South Australian and ACT Attorneys-General to adopt the approach of the Model Criminal Code which will outlaw the use of the `drunks defence'. This announcement comes on top of a number of initiatives introduced by the Howard government to combat domestic and family violence in Australian homes. Initiatives include the launch of the rural domestic violence information kit by the Minister for the Status of Women, the Hon. Judi Moylan, on 15 October this year and the establishment of the rural and remote domestic violence initiative pilot program. Closely allied with the supported accommodation assistance program, the pilot program has set up a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8324"> number of information and referral services in rural and remote locations across Australia for women and children escaping domestic violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Domestic Violence Summit convened by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) will for the first time bring together the Commonwealth and states and territories to establish a coordinated national four-year plan. On a personal note, I am looking forward to participating in the Women's Emergency Services Network's first national conference in over 10 years, scheduled for early December 1997. The conference is called `Working with women and children escaping violence: strategies into the millennium'. The themes of the conference are access and equity, responding to the diversity of need, national directions and how to move our decisions forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not dwell too heavily on this most recent case involving the football star. Equally distressing events of domestic violence and drunkenness occur every day to average Australians and largely go unnoticed. But this is not an issue for the too&hyphen;hard basket. Rather, we can work together to eradicate existing anomalies in the law and have common legal standards across the country which send the unequivocal message that violence of any description cannot and will not be tolerated, least of all when a person is so drunk that they risk losing not only any sense of individual responsibility but also their own self&hyphen;respect.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8324"><TITLE>Breast Cancer Awareness Week</TITLE>

The excellent advances in the treatment of breast cancers will be lost if we do not do the research into the cause of this insidious disease.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk today about a body of research which is emerging on the links between melatonin, Tamoxifen, 50 to 60 hertz electromagnetic fields and breast cancer. At the first world conference on breast cancer held in Canada in July this year, consultant Cindy Sage said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 1979, scientific studies have linked electromagnetic field exposure and various cancers, including breast cancer. EMF has been reported in epidemiological, laboratory and whole animal studies to be associated with increased breast cancer rates and several hypotheses have been offered, including melatonin modulation and cellular membrane dysfunction. If EMF is even a small risk factor for breast cancer, the public health consequence will be very large, given the incidence of that disease.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Decision making on public health issues where there is a large industry presence, which may suffer financial consequences with the admission of liability for carcinogenic product, creates a most difficult climate for funding, evaluating and acting on new scientific information. The state of the science becomes a battleground where scientific uncertainty (or lack of causal evidence of scientific proof) is argued as reason to defer action or take trivial or meaningless action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Standards of evidence for triggering interim public health advisories are different than the standard for scientific certainty. A lower threshold of evidence is permissible where the weight of the evidence warrants interim action. To wait for conclusive scientific evidence as judged by purely scientific research standards is inappropriate where the weight of the  existing evidence is persuasive, the trends of studies is generally positive and consistently confirmed and the consequence of taking no action has a potentially large adverse public health impact and where relative costs of avoidance of the risk may be low.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As the Senate will be aware, the Democrats have, a number of times, alerted the government to the need for research. To give it its dues, $4.5 million was set aside for research into the health effects of electromagnetic radiation in the last budget. The Senate will also have noticed that the NHMRC called this week for applications for that research money. So it is timely this week to mention breast cancer in this context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will seek to incorporate a discussion paper on the subject, which has been prepared by Mr Don Maisch. The paper draws on a range of research material which shows that low&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8325"> level exposure to 50&hyphen;60 hertz electromagnetic fields, which is the powerline frequency, may block the body's natural production of melatonin and, therefore, its ability to suppress breast cancer cells. Melatonin, for the information of the Senate, is produced at night by the pineal glands and it acts to clean up cancer cells.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The studies referred to in this paper have been done only in the last few years and many of them are still awaiting peer review processes. Of course, this process can take years. In most circumstances it is quite proper to wait for the peer review to be completed. We know that the telecommunications industry, for instance, often dismissed research because it has not been replicated. As we also know, research dollars are very tight and it is usually the new and the groundbreaking research which will be funded ahead of replication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument I want to make here is that the $4.5 million is not a lot when, firstly, it is spread over four years and when, secondly, you see it in light of the fact that research is very costly. For instance, it cost Telstra $500,000 to conduct its research into exposing mice to mobile phone frequencies quite recently. Research costs money and it takes time but the point is that, where there is a reasonable doubt, we cannot afford to ignore the evidence and we have to take some precautionary measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To return to the paper that I referred to earlier, Australian exposure standards are currently designed to avoid immediate high&hyphen;level hazards. The guidelines that we have in this country are for 1,000 milliGauss for residential and 5,000 milliGauss for occupational exposure. What these standards do not consider is the prolonged, low&hyphen;level exposure of the 50&hyphen;60 hertz field. Researchers have, for some time, suspected that low&hyphen;level powerline frequency magnetic fields in the 50&hyphen;60 hertz range may reduce the pineal gland's production of melatonin. Its ability to suppress cancer cells is referred to as `melatonin hypothesis'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the program bulletin of the Second World Congress for Electricity and Magnetism and Biology and Medicine, held in Italy 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in June this year, mention is made of this melatonin hypothesis:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of experimental studies have been conducted to test the melatonin hypothesis. Although the literature is still evolving and consensus is being built, it is fair to say a) there exists credible scientific support for the hypothesis and, importantly b) this support encompasses in vitro, in vivo, and epidemiological research. The melatonin hypothesis, thus, currently represents one of the more well documented/tested interactions in the field of bioelectromagnetics.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The question which is posed in this discussion paper is: what is the medical fraternity to do when it is presented with a significant body of scientific evidence that exposure to low&hyphen;level powerline frequency magnetic fields may well be a risk factor in breast cancer?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge senators and the public to read this discussion paper. Much of it is quite technical, but if we can get beyond questions of treatment and early detection of breast cancer, and make some inroads into that three per cent increase in breast cancer incidence, then we need to be open to exploring possible causes and we need to be prepared to take action on the remedies which arise from those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concerns expressed in this discussion paper are not about powerlines per se. At the Italian congress, a paper was presented by the University of Tokyo which reported on a study which set out to determine whether the effects of long&hyphen;term powerline frequency EMF from electric blanket exposure, for instance, suppressed the melatonin in humans. The study suggested that exposure to electromagnetic fields through frequent use of electric blankets:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . could lead to changes in melatonin production and rhythm, at least in highly sensitive individuals.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The subjects in this study were healthy young male volunteers. The authors wrote of a need for more research into the effects on immune systems that are already under strain; for example, chemotherapy patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Long&hyphen;term employment trends for women point to an urgent need for research into occupational EMF exposure. Through part&hyphen; and full&hyphen;time work in service industries and offices, women are increasingly engaged in work involving a high degree of VDU use. A 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8326"> Boston University study on breast cancer rates found that a 43 per cent increase in breast cancer was apparent amongst women with a high potential for occupational exposure to magnetic fields; namely, women working with mainframe computers. Several studies have detected little, if any, change in melatonin levels overnight and on weekends in office workers, suggesting that electromagnetic frequency exposure is a persistent entity. It seems the reduction in melatonin levels from a full week in the office cannot be counteracted by a weekend break or by spending the occasional day at work away from the computer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With breast cancer prevention high on our research agenda, we cannot afford to neglect the possible role of EMF exposure. The International Breast Cancer Intervention Study, which has been running for five years, is investigating whether the drug Tamoxifen can be used as a prophylactic by women who have a strong family predisposition towards breast cancer. The participants are women aged from 35 to 70 from the UK, New Zealand, Australia and Europe. Various studies suggest that the inhibitory effect of Tamoxifen in cancerous cells may be reduced by electromagnetic frequency exposure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have just managed a couple of excerpts from that discussion paper. Time does not allow me to go into more detail on those but I think it is time that we stopped sitting back and saying, `There needs to be a balance of interests,' and trotting out those age&hyphen;old arguments about the risks of getting this disease being akin to being run over by a bus. That sort of fatalism, which says that if it happens it happens, is all very well until it hits you or somebody in your family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I urge senators to read the discussion paper and to do more than endorse awareness about breast cancer. My message is that the research must be done and, in the meantime, there should be a much greater awareness of the need to act in a precautionary manner.

These figures reflect a growing community concern and as a consequence, in 1995 the Federal Government allocated $3 million over a 3 year period, solely for breast cancer studies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is unfortunate however, that apparently no current Australian breast cancer research is examining the growing evidence that low level exposures to 50-60 hertz electromagnetic fields (EMF) may block melatonin's ability to suppress breast cancer cells and reduce the pineal gland's nocturnal production of melatonin, thereby increasing susceptibility to breast cancer. This evidence consists of both human and laboratory studies, some of which are summarised in this paper. Almost all of these studies have been conducted only within the last few years and are still awaiting the peer review process which can take years to complete. As a result, many of these studies do not yet constitute part of the body of substantiated scientific evidence, often referred to by national and international expert regulatory groups, such as the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In drafting its own guidelines for both residential and occupational exposure to powerline frequency (50-60 Hz) EMFs, Australian authorities, such as the National Health &amp; Medical Research Council (NH&amp;MRC) and the Australian Radiation Laboratory (ARL) have taken their maximum exposure guidelines from overseas expert groups, mainly the ICNIRP, which are as follows, (for magnetic fields):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For Residential Exposures: 1000 milliGauss (mG)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For Occupational Exposures: 5000 milliGauss.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the official position taken by Australian regulatory bodies. However it is important to note that these guidelines are only designed to avoid immediate high level hazards and do not consider prolonged low-level exposures at all. This was admitted in 1991 by Dr Keith Lokan, from the ARL in a conference paper published in Radiation Protection in Australia (Vol 9 No.4, 1991), referring to IRPA/INIRC guidelines which were taken over by the ICNIRP in 1993 and reconfirmed at that time. To quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`These limits [as above] represent plausible field values, below which immediate adverse health effects are unlikely, and as such serve a useful purpose. They are NOT intended to provide protection against possible cancer induction by continued exposure at the lower field levels implicated in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> studies we have been considering at this workshop. (1 to 3 mG).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So not only do the official guidelines fail to consider low level exposures but the scientific research they are based upon (substantiated evidence) was last considered in 1993, when the current ICNIRP guidelines were reconfirmed. This predates the entire body of evidence as examined in this report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The idea that low level powerline frequency magnetic fields may reduce the pineal gland's production of melatonin and that melatonin's ability to suppress cancer cells is blocked by these fields, is called the `melatonin hypothesis'. At the recent international conference, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Second World Congress for Electricity and Magnetism in Biology and Medicine, </EMPHASIS> held in Bologna, Italy in June of 1997, it is mentioned in the program bulletin:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`A number of experimental studies have been conducted to test-the  [melatonin] hypothesis. Although the literature is still evolving and consensus is being built, it is fair to say, a) there exists credible scientific support for the hypothesis and, importantly, b) this support encompasses in vitro, in vivo, and epidemiological research. The melatonin hypothesis, thus, currently represents one of the more well documented/tested interactions in the field of bioelectromagnetics.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the medical fraternity to do when presented with a significant body of reputable scientific evidence that exposure to low level powerline frequency magnetic fields may well be a risk factor in breast cancer? Advice from such government bodies such as the NH&amp;MRC and the ARL can only reflect their official position as mentioned above.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Considering the prevalence of breast cancer in Western society and the extensive body of recent evidence pointing to a connection with EMF exposure, it is the position of this report that with breast cancer patients, avoiding excessive EMF exposure should be part of the treatment, under the Precautionary Principal, which in this case could be defined as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The precautionary principal should guide decision-makers when confronted by potential threats to human health. The lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent exposure to these potential threats. If measures generally reducing exposure can be taken at reasonable expense and with reasonable consequences in all other respects, an effort should be made to reduce exposures to a level below that level which evidence indicates may be harmful to health.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">1.0: Melatonin</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both human and animal circadian rhythms are driven by the day/night cycle and are synchronised 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8328"> with natural geomagnetic electromagnetic fields. The major control gland over this natural cycle is the pineal gland which secretes the neurohormone melatonin. During the day, light falling on the eye's retina produces signals which are biochemically amplified to stimulate the pineal gland to reduce its melatonin output. At night the absence of light with sleep stimulates the pineal gland to produce melatonin. The circadian production of melatonin is thought to control important processes in the eyes, including restoration of rods (for night vision) at the end of the night, and renewal of cones (for colour vision) at the end of the day. One theory on how man made EMF's may affect the pineal gland is that the pineal gland may `sense' EMF's as light and therefore reduce melatonin production. A possible cause for such an effect is from insoluble granular material contained within the pineal gland.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research by Dr. Sidney Lang, an expert on piezoelectricity, which is the production of electric fields by pressure on crystalline structures, has shown that the pineal gland has piezoelectrical activity. Dr Lang hypothesises that this activity is a function of this granular material and if so it may be responding to narrow wave lengths. ( 1 )</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once melatonin is produced, its ability to pass through the cell membrane allows it to pass directly into the blood stream. Once in the blood melatonin has access to every cell in the body where it passes through the cell membrane to the cell nucleus, which has receptors for it. A few cell membranes also have receptors for melatonin, which may control the 24 hour circadian rhythm of the endocrine system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the cell nucleus, melatonin plays a role in regulating gene expression. The ability of melatonin to enter all cells is also essential for one of the other important functions of melatonin, which is to act as a scavenger of highly toxic oxygen-based free radicals. The production of these free radicals is a consequence of the utilisation of oxygen by all organisms. About 1-2% of inspired oxygen ends up as toxic free radicals which can damage macromolecules such as DNA, proteins and lipids. This damage is referred to as oxidative stress.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of its ability to eliminate free radicals, melatonin is probably the most efficient natural cell protection and oncostatic agent in our bodies. At night, melatonin production floods our bodies, eliminating the build up of free radicals that are being produced, allowing the DNA synthesis and cell division to occur with a far lower chance of damage and hence producing more healthy cells. Melatonin also dampens the release of oestrogen, prolonged exposure to which may increase the risk of breast cancer. (2)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As for the role of melatonin in effective chemotherapy, researchers at the Tumor Radiation Laboratory at the University of Milan in Italy found 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that elevated blood levels of melatonin significantly enhanced the effectiveness of chemotherapy. The study included 42 cancer patients of both sexes, including 10 breast cancer patients, 13 lung cancer patients, and 11 colon cancer patients. It was found that 75% (12 of 16) patients whose melatonin levels were enhanced after chemotherapy exhibited objectively measured tumor regression, whereas only 8% (2 of 26 patients) whose melatonin levels did not go up after chemotherapy exhibited tumor regression.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does not necessarily mean that the above <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">in vitro </EMPHASIS> study conclusions can be directly applied to breast cancer patients. However, it is important to note that some recent human exposure studies also indicate a melatonin/EMF effect, and that levels around 12 mG can be routinely encountered in daily life, for example, electric blankets can give emissions in excess of 12 mG, depending upon manufacturer and setting used. Sleeping with an electric blanket on is a special concern, as it is at night that the pineal gland, located near the centre of the brain, produces melatonin. In the study by Liburdy and Harland, indications were that a prolonged exposure may be required, which is a further possible implication of electric blanket use while sleeping.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a study by Yaofei Liu and Dr. Indra Chatterjee at the University of Nevada they found that with electric blankets, `The average current density (induced in the body) in the head is higher than the torso because of the smaller cross section of the head.' (11)</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Nocturnal exposures to 50 Hz EMF generated from electric blankets was not related to melatonin production in terms of its mean values (for 8 subjects excluding one whose rhythm could not be calculated) but showed tendencies of suppressing peak value and/or delaying phase of melatonin rhythm in 7 of the 8 subjects. The present findings may suggest a possibility that exposure to ELF-EMF by electric blankets, if magnitude and duration are sufficient, could lead to changes in melatonin production and its rhythm, at least in highly sensitive individuals. However, a definitive conclusion could not be obtained from only the present results, since the experiments were performed under unrestricted daily lives. Experiments with major possible modifying factors for melatonin metabolism being controlled are warranted.' (12)</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a soon to be published follow up study by Dr. Henry Lai and Dr. Narendra Singh, who earlier found single and double strand DNA breaks in rats exposed to low level radiofrequency radiation (RFR) after a single two hour exposure, the treatment of either melatonin or a free radical scavenger (PBN) to the exposed rats immediately before and after RFR exposure prevented the DNA damage.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This indicates the importance of melatonin in DNA repair mechanisms, and therefore in cancer suppression, but not that the RFR is effecting the rats own pineal melatonin production.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.2: A preliminary study of 60 workers at a Finnish garment factory found `a highly significant effect' of EMFs in reducing nocturnal melatonin levels. Magnetic field measurements were taken for the two types of machines used in the factory and operators were assigned to high or low exposure groups, based on the type of machine they were using, with average exposures either above of below 10 milliGauss. Unexposed non industrial workers were used as controls. The results of this study found strong effects of both magnetic field exposure and smoking on night time levels of melatonin. No difference was found in melatonin levels on week nights and Sunday nights, indicating `that the possible suppression caused by magnetic field exposure is chronic, with little recovery during the weekend.'

The lack of an effect on the first day (following a weekend or equivalent) may indicate a cumulative effect of exposure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some studies have suggested that EMF effects on melatonin may depend on whether the field is continuous or intermittent. Reif and Burch found that magnetic fields in the home that were `tempo

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.4: Office workers who used computer monitors (VDU's) had a significant reduction in circulating levels of melatonin over a course of the working day, according to a study by researchers Drs. Bengt Arnetz of the Karolinska Institute, and Mats Berg of the Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm Sweden. No such change was found during days at the office with no VDU use. According to the researchers; `This suggests that there is a direct impact from the electromagnetic environment of the VDU on levels of melatonin.' Levels of a different hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), went up during the working day and this showed a strong correlation with worker's subjective assessment of mental strain. Arnetz and Berg note that ACTH is `known as a classic stress hormone that reacts to mental strain.' But in contrast, `occupational strain did not correlate with melatonin levels.' (19)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This finding supports the Boston University breast cancer study, in which Patrica Coogan and co-workers found a 43% increase in breast cancer among women with a high potential for occupational exposures to magnetic fields, notably those working with main&hyphen;frame computers.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not all human exposure studies found a melatonin reduction effect. A study by Dr. Charles Graham <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">et al </EMPHASIS> at the Midwest Research Laboratory in Kansas City, MO. conducted for the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), found that a continuous 60 Hz, 200 mG magnetic field applied to people while they slept had no effect on nocturnal melatonin levels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a similar study published in 1994, Graham found no overall effect for intermittent EMF exposures, however, data from that study showed that men with preexisting low levels of melatonin had even lower levels when exposed to EMF's, suggesting that a person's prior melatonin level may be an important factor. Later research by Graham, failed to replicate this finding however.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Graham cautions against a conclusion that EMF's do not effect melatonin.

Thus, if in fact artificial electromagnetic field exposure increases the incidence of cancer in humans, a plausible mechanism could involve a reduction in melatonin which is a consequence of such exposures.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr. Reiter also notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Epidemiologists should look for other possible changes, including psychological depression, fatigue, sleep inefficiency, chronic feelings of jet lag, endocrine disturbances and other symptoms; all these may result from a chronically low melatonin rhythm.' (25)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of his latest study Dr. Reiter now proposes that melatonin is `more rapidly taken up into tissues during the exposure'. He noted that if EMF's result in higher levels of free radicals, then an antioxidant like melatonin `would disappear from the blood more quickly than is normal because it would be required for the scavenging of free radicals'. (26)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Reiter's hypothesis is correct, then prolonged exposures may tax the pineal gland's ability to maintain adequate levels of melatonin to cope with the extra stress created by EMF exposure, and also Tamoxifen's ability to inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">6.0: World Conference on Breast Cancer on the U.S. National Cancer Institute Linet Study</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At The First World Conference On Breast Cancer, held at Queens University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada, from 13 to 17 July 1997, over 600 delegates from around the world met to establish a Global Action Plan to eradicate breast cancer, which currently affects one in eight women in North America. This plan will later be presented to the United Nations, the World Health Organisation and other major international organisations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted in the conference bulletin, the conference was `a massive and truly global undertaking, organised by grass-roots women's organisations, survivors, environmental groups, scientists and health-care professionals. For the first time ever, the voices of the women and others most affected by this disease will take centre stage, as experts from around the globe assemble to share knowledge and experience of this complex problem.' Less than two weeks before the conference, the U.S. National Cancer Institute released a study, conducted by Dr. Martha Linet and co-workers, in which it was claimed that there was no evidence that powerline electromagnetic fields increase childhood leukemia risks. This study was published on July 3rd 1997 in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New England Journal of Medicine </EMPHASIS> and has widely been mis-reported in the world's media as the final word in exonerating powerline frequency EMFs from any connection with cancer. This line is also being promoted as proof that future research into EMFs and cancer should cease.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NCI study was specifically examined at the conference and many concerns were raised on the calls for ending future EMF health effects research, based on the NCI Linet study. The following is a joint press release on the NCI study from the conference:</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Dateline: 1st World Conference on Breast Cancer, Kingston, Ontario, Canada, July 15, 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The recent report in the New England Journal of Medicine by Linet and colleagues has been widely reported as showing no link between exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) and one type of leukemia in children. On the basis of this new study, some scientists and some news media organisations, including the major networks, have repeated the questionable claim that the link between EMF exposure and cancer risk is no longer an issue, and further research is unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such statements, based on a single study, are troubling. More disturbing still, is the fact that the data presented in the Linet study do not support the assertion that no link exists. Even a cursory review of the main data set shows a 53% increase in leukemia incidence at magnetic field exposure 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> levels above 2 mG; a 72% increase (which is statistically significant) above 3 mG; and a more than 600% increase at exposures of between 4 and 5 mG. Above 5 mG, no link is shown, but there are too few cases in this range to yield any significant result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr. Bary Wilson, who has co-authored a recent book on EMF and breast cancer, and several other speakers at the World Conference on Breast Cancer, including Dr. Kjeli Hansson Mild of National Institute of Working Life in Sweden, have stated that a study which is apparently positive and limited only to leukemia should not be used to discount a possible link between EMF and cancer in its entirety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any statement claiming the demise of the EMF and cancer issue should be based on an analysis of all the available data and not one study, particularly one in which the reported data are apparently not reflected in the conclusions. In fact, available data on the subject, provided by many scientists over more than a decade, do not support the hypothesis that there is no link between EMF exposure and increased risk for several types of cancer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cindy Sage of Sage Associates and Chair of the EMF program at the conference points out that, `even a small increased risk of breast cancer due to EMF exposure has enormous public health implications given the high incidence of this disease in developed countries.' Based on the Linet, et al. study, it is clearly not justified to call for the end of research into the possible link between EMF and cancer. Given the growing body of evidence for a possible link between EMF and breast cancer, in particular, cessation of research funding at this time would be reckless and scientifically indefensible.'</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">7.0: Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence as outlined in this report, quite clearly identifies commonly encountered environmental magnetic fields of 12 milliGauss, with a possible dose-response relationship down to 2 milliGauss, as being a probable cancer promoter. As to the role of cancer promoters, Dr. Robert O.Becker in his book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cross Currents </EMPHASIS> states:  `Cancer promoters, however, have major implications for the incidence of cancer because they increase the number of cases of cancer that become evident. We are constantly exposed to cancer-causing agents in our  environment ranging from carcinogenic chemicals to cosmic rays. As a result, we are always developing small cancers that are recognised by our immune system and destroyed. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8334"> Any factor that increases the growth rate of these small cancers gives them an advantage over the immune system, as a result more people develop clinical cancers that require treatment.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, it would be fair to say that in the situation of residential and occupational exposures, where cancer patients are routinely being exposed to levels in the order of 12 mG, the necessity of avoiding these exposures is paramount.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the recent World Conference on Breast Cancer, held in Ontario Canada, there is an increasing overseas awareness that EMFs are a risk factor with breast cancer, but at present there are no figures as to the degree of risk. In relation to breast cancer patients, an important first step is to determine how many are being exposed to EMFs of the order of 2 to 12 mG?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important initial step would be to conduct detailed surveys of groups of breast cancer patients to build up a profile of any prolonged exposures in relation to the 12 milliGauss level. If we take 2 mG as a no-effect level and 12 + mG as a definite level of effect, we could get some idea of the percentage of participants who are most likely at increased risk from this exposure. Ideally such a survey would be conducted independently in several countries, using the same criteria and results then compared.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The outcome of this would be to develop effective advice for patients to avoid exposures, which can come from many sources, such as electric blankets, electrically heated water beds, improperly grounded home wiring, in-floor electrical heating systems, older computer monitors, florescent lighting systems, occupational exposures, etc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although this paper only deals with powerline EMFs, electromagnetic radiation (EMR) from radiofrequency and microwave emissions are also now being implicated in breast cancer. Besides some epidemiological studies, such as one showing a significant increase in breast cancer for female radio operators, there is evidence that breast cancer tumours absorb significantly more EMR than other cancers, or healthy tissue. To quote from one study, conducted at Duke University, North Carolina, USA, in 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`In general, at all frequencies tested [50 to 900 MHz], both conductivity and relative permittivity were greater in malignant tissue than in normal tissue of the same type. For tissues of the same type, the differences in electrical properties from normal to malignant were least for kidney (about  6% and 4% average differences over the frequency range in permittivity and conductivity, respectively), and these differences were the greatest for mammary gland (about 233% and 577% average differences in permittivity and conductivity, respectively).' (27) 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ability of breast cancer tumours to absorb significantly more EMR than normal tissue should be of concern when compared to an official joint statement, made in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Information sheet, Safety of Mobile Phones and Towers&mdash;The Answers </EMPHASIS> (Nov.1995) by the Australian Radiation Laboratory, Spectrum Management Agency, Austel and the Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organisation, (under the heading, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Is Cancer an issue?)  </EMPHASIS> `There is yet insufficient scientific knowledge of many aspects of health effects of radio waves. One common question is: Do radio waves from mobile phones increase the risks of cancer? The answer is that there is no experimental evidence that radio waves directly cause cancer. Laboratory studies on animals suggest that where cancer exists, radio waves may  accelerate its growth.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For this reason, acting under the Precautionaly Principal as mentioned previously, one should also consider radiofrequency and microwave exposures as a possible risk factor to be avoided.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator. People in the southern areas of Australia regard the north as remote but, in reality, the north is in close proximity to Asia and, as such, should really be regarded as Australia's front door.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the north of Australia in general, and the north of Western Australia in particular, has enormous potential for tourist development. Overseas visitors come to Australia to see things which are different, and the things which are different about Australia are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8336"> in the north of Australia, whether they are the Great Barrier Reef in north Queensland; the Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory; or the Purnululu National Park, the Karijini National Park and the Ningaloo Reef on the west coast. All of these things are in the north. The north offers visitors contrast; the wide open spaces, the richness of the colours and the striking natural beauty of the region make the north especially attractive to visitors from middle Europe&mdash;countries such as Austria, Switzerland and Scandinavia&mdash;where the conditions, especially the climate, are in strong contrast to those they find in their own countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By promoting the diversity of this region, the economic benefits will follow, not only to the states concerned but also to Australia as a whole. I would like to congratulate both the state and federal governments for their foresight in using marketing strategies and grant allocations for development of the tourist industry both in Australia in general and in the north in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the interest of senators, I would like to quote some figures which give an idea of the economic importance and the  scale of the tourist industry of Australia. Nationally, the tourist industry employs seven per cent of Australia's work force. It contributed 15 per cent of Australia's total export earnings and around seven per cent of our national gross domestic product; that is, a sum of around $36 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The projections for growth in the tourism industry, according to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, the Hon. John Moore, are also very promising. In the year 2006, 8.8 million overseas visitors are forecast to come to Australia, which is double the number that came in 1996. The tourism industry has shown its capacity to provide sustainable economic growth over an extended period of time and, as time goes on, will become an increasingly important industry in the Australian economy. In Western Australia, the tourism and travel industry contributes some four per cent to the state gross product. In 1995&hyphen;96 it generated between seven and eight per cent of employment in Western Australia. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the Western Australian government and the federal government are continuing to provide incentives to assist the growth of a sustainable tourism industry. Tourism in Australia has been targeted and assistance has been provided, especially for small tourist operators which, in the long run, will benefit the economic development of regional Australia, providing sustainable employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Western Australian Tourism Commission, through its office in London, is promoting Western Australia as an adventure, diving and nature based holiday destination to tie in with the trend for tailored tourism facilities and services. This trend, already evident in Europe, is set to develop in the Asian market over the next five years. The trend to promote the natural environment has also been taken up by the federal government through its national tourism development program. Destination Australia identifies tourism as a high national priority and aims to spread the benefits of tourism to regional Australia, capitalising on the trend of tourism to experience something beyond the city based package tour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The announcement by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism of the national tourism development program will benefit the development of sustainable tourism enterprises outside major urban areas and international gateways. This program will be of great benefit to the tourist operators of the north&hyphen;west of Western Australia, as well as to those of the Northern Territory and north Queensland. The projects that have been selected under this program have been selected to meet national tourism development needs, provide tourism enterprise building models, and generate flow&hyphen;on benefits to regional and rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Western Australia, the Federal Government has allocated a grant to the Monkey Mia Visitors Centre through the WA Tourism Commission and the Department of Conservation and Land Management&mdash;known as CALM&mdash;in the Gascoyne region of the state. This grant was allocated because it meets the abovementioned guidelines and will assist the development of a new visitors centre, as the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8337"> old centre could not accommodate the growing number of visitors to Monkey Mia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to promoting Monkey Mia, it will have the dual purpose of assisting visitors with information about the Shark Bay world heritage area, Hamelin Pool, Shell Beach, the Francois Peron National Park, the Kennedy Ranges and Dirk Hartog's landing. Dirk Hartog came to Western Australia in 1616, long before Cook came up the eastern Australian coast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently launched the Green Corps program in Shark Bay, which is in the Francois Peron National Park. It is a very lovely area and is an extremely useful example of the initiative of the government in helping to develop infrastructure in some of these places. The group in Shark Bay is renovating the Old Denham Homestead and helping to prepare a resource centre for tourists. This project is integrated with the aims and objectives of funding allocated through the national tourism development fund. The project is also linked to programs within the $1 billion commitment under the National Heritage Trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia and, in particular, Western Australia must capitalise on the natural benefits of areas such as Shark Bay and the Ningaloo Reef through ecologically sustainable tourism enterprises to provide opportunities for business growth and employment in regional and rural Australia. Another project which received funding was Oxers Lookout, in the Karijini National Park. The Karijinis used to be known as the Hamersley Ranges, and Oxers Lookout was named after a Wittenoom doctor who loved the Hamersley gorges. After he died his ashes were scattered through the area. The lookout, which is located in a high position in the Hamersley Ranges, was causing safety concerns, so it was allocated a grant to assist the financing of two new lookout platforms and the provision of picnic tables and wheelchair access. This project is strongly supported by local tourism associations, the Karijini Aboriginal Corporation and tour operators who share concerns about the safety of visitors to this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again in Western Australia in the Kimberley region, a group called Kimberley Cultural Expeditions was provided a grant to assist the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> operations of its 10&hyphen;day cultural tour from Broome to Kununurra. This venture is Aboriginal&hyphen;owned and involves 10 Aboriginal communities who give tourists insights into the Kimberley region and some experience of Aboriginal culture, for example, samples of bush tucker. The project aims to attract an increased number of domestic and international tourists to the Kimberley region, and will provide employment opportunities for indigenous communities. It will also enable participating communities to enjoy the economic benefits of tourism and will be used as an incentive to pursue new tourism ventures in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1997&hyphen;98 budget, the Federal Government also announced an extension to the export market development grants scheme which will enable tourist operators to access funding through this program. This will mean that tourist operators will be able to enhance the export marketing of their programs and claim as promotional expenses, for instance, the actual cost of providing samples of these services to wholesalers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During 1996&hyphen;97, 375 Western Australian companies received more than $20 million in export market development grants. As I have stated, from 1997&hyphen;98 tourist operators will be able to access these grants. I encourage tourist operators throughout the country&mdash;especially those in the north&mdash;to consider applying for such grants, which will greatly assist them in developing their programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Kimberley Tourist Association has also initiated a regional awards scheme to increase recognition of quality tourist operations in that area. The various categories include a land operator award, a charter operator award, an accommodation award, an individual award, an aviation award and a new product development award. These awards, which were presented only a few days ago at Fitzroy Crossing, sought to recognise those who have contributed to tourist development in one of the more remote areas of Australia. The awards give recognition to the innovation and enterprise of the people involved in developing tourism in the Kimberley area.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8338">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the Kimberley Wilderness Adventure tour operator, which was the winner of the land operator award; Triple J, the winner of the charter boat operator award; Singlair Heliwork WA, winners of the aviation ward; `Kimberley Klub', the winner of the accommodation award; and the Broome Brewery and Matso's Gallery, the winner of the new product development award. The individual award was given to Steve Sharpe from Lake Argyle Cruises. I congratulate all the winners of these inaugural awards and commend the contribution they have made to regional and rural employment in the north&hyphen;west.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, of importance in terms of access to the north of Australia is international air access. There are presently target markets of backpackers in South&hyphen;East Asia who come down as far as Thailand and Indonesia and who could be encouraged to come into Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon, in this matters of public interest debate, I will address the issue of recent criticisms of and by the judiciary generally. Honourable senators may recall recently that the Chief Justice of the High Court embarked on an attempted defence of the judiciary in his recent speech to the 30th Australian Legal Convention, where he was somewhat critical of the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His Honour's comments were variously reported and attracted headlines such as `Bombshell by the Chief Justice'. His speech was described as `slamming the Attorney&hyphen;General', which of course gave an opening to the shadow Attorney&hyphen;General (Senator Bolkus) to enter onto the stage as well. At best it was very naive of His Honour to give the opposition such an opening; at worst, a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> deliberate entry into the political fray. I must say I believe it was the former.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was this bombshell? His Honour was upset that the Attorney&hyphen;General did not defend the High Court and the judiciary against political attacks. He asked, `Why should an Attorney&hyphen;General not defend the reputation of the judiciary, explain the nature of the judicial process and repel attacks?' The chief justice's desperate plea for someone to defend the judiciary is, I submit, pitiful, but also exposes the chief justice's incapacity to comprehend the judiciary's self&hyphen;made problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once you have lost respect you are not going to win it back by trying to bully the Attorney&hyphen;General into running a defence on behalf of the court. The simple fact is the attacks on some elements of the judiciary are the products of those same judicial officers playing politics and being political. The chief justice must surely understand that, just as an umpire cannot don the colours of his favourite team and then demand respect for the independence of his decisions, similarly judges cannot stoop to partisan political debate and then claim immunity, trying to hide under wig and gown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe His Honour would have done a greater service to this nation and the concept of separation of powers and respect for the judiciary if he had called upon his fellow judges to refrain from political controversy and abide by legal principles. Such a message would have automatically commanded respect. His injudicious demand seeking respect will, I fear, have the opposite impact. You cannot demand respect; you can only command it and then, by your own presentation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chief justice is surely not oblivious to the behaviour of some of his fellow judges. Examples of this behaviour include a Supreme Court judge addressing a rally called to dissuade the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) from pursuing certain amendments to the Native Title Act. According to the chief justice we should accept such partisan behaviour. I submit that such behaviour disqualifies the judge from the respect the chief justice craves, as does the behaviour by a Federal Court judge who attacked the government's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8339"> 10&hyphen;point plan in response to the Wik High Court decision, and urged people to see something sinister about the plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That judge's criticism was at a forum where I was present, and it was more strident than that of the Aboriginal activist who was putting the indigenous case. One wonders why a judge of the Federal Court found it necessary to be so strident and, indeed, extreme and political in that criticism. Unfortunately, every level of the judiciary is tainted by the antics of some who are clearly&mdash;in my mind, at least&mdash;frustrated legislators. Possibly the most gross example is that of the Chief Justice of the Family Court. I note with interest that the previous government, through its now shadow Attorney&hyphen;General, said of this judge that he had `damaged the integrity of his office with his ill&hyphen;informed and factually incorrect comments.' They were the words of the then minister for immigration, Senator Bolkus, the now shadow Attorney&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of us on this side of politics find ourselves  agreeing with Senator Bolkus&mdash;albeit that it is somewhat distasteful for us to be seen to do so. Both sides of politics have had occasion to highlight this behaviour which, unfortunately, reflects poorly on the judiciary as a whole. In an expose of the Family Court, recently printed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, we are told, `The court is a very nasty political place,'&mdash;the `court' being the Family Court&mdash;`the way they got rid of people they did not want absolutely appalled me.' Yet the Chief Justice of the Family Court tells us politicians how to run the affairs of state when his own court is subject to substantial criticism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the chief justice's attack on One Nation is, I submit, similarly unacceptable. Let me state for the record that I agree personally with his criticisms of One Nation, but I do not believe it is appropriate for a judicial officer to come into a political debate taking one side or the other. Although I agree with his criticisms of One Nation, my argument is that it is not for him to make those sorts of criticisms. I would submit that it is not for a judge in a non&hyphen;judicial context to accuse an elected parliamentarian of `bigotry, xenopho 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bia, racial intolerance and misinformation', and then make links with Nazism.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="N26">Senator ABETZ</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ian Macdonald raises the point, `I hope she never has to go to his court' and that is the point I am about to make, Senator Macdonald. You, as a former lawyer like myself, understand the principles very well. It is the exactly the same behaviour that the Chief Judge of the High Court railed against when he sought protection from politicians who make allegations that the High Court has made the country ungovernable. The question, of course, has to be asked. If I were a family court lawyer and I happened to know that my client's spouse had somehow had an involvement in One Nation, take the tip: if I knew the Chief Judge was going to sit on that case, I would try to wangle it into the affidavit material to let His Honour know that the person on the other side had in fact had some involvement with One Nation&mdash;because the judge had already shown a gross bias towards One Nation. I might add that it is a bias which I personally share with His Honour, but he should not have been making those sorts of comments in the gratuitous way that he did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example can be seen on page 636 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee of 7 March 1997 where we were discussing legal aid, and the Family Court put in a submission signed off by the Chief Judge. This statement was in it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economic rationalist argument that `the community can no longer afford it' does not stand up to international comparisons . . . and is, in any event, a generalisation without substance . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would have thought, with respect, that if the Family Court were concerned about these matters they could have sent along a non&hyphen;judicial registrar who could have given expression to those sorts of concerns on behalf of the Family Court administration, without the judge involving himself in that sort of partisan comment. I put to His Honour, `I am just wondering about the wisdom of the judiciary embarking upon such a course.' His Honour replied:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8340">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that there are difficulties about that course. But I am certainly not going to back off from what the court has said in relation to these matters, because we do think there is a mistaken approach being taken.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Take the tip. If he thinks the federal government and the executive have taken a mistaken approach to certain elements of those things which are clearly within the province of government, why should it then be that we as parliamentarians are not allowed to comment on those things which are clearly in the judicial domain when judges make decisions? It is a two&hyphen;way street. The judges in this country cannot have it both ways&mdash;as seems to be the case, as it has been presented by His Honour Chief Justice Brennan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will make further reference to His Honour the Chief Judge of the Family Court. In an address on 3 August 1996 to the Law Society of Western Australia, he was basically defending himself in relation to a speech that he had made. On page 8 of that speech in Western Australia, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the most unusual responses from a politician was that my remarks reflected `narrow cast but very trendy beliefs'&mdash;a rather unusual claim to fame for a Judge! They were also considered `an attack on the institution of the family' and a step towards a `non&hyphen;reproductive society' which had to be fought `tooth and nail.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Just in case we did not know who had said all those things, he kindly footnoted it and told us that it was the Deputy Prime Minister of this country, Mr Tim Fischer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the judge is going to make comments about political debate in this country gratuitously when he is invited to give speeches, he does invite political partisan comment in return. That unfortunately embroils His Honour in partisan political debate where there is a conflict of ideas and a conflict of values, and I believe that that besmirches His Honour then when he seeks to sit on the bench and be seen as completely independent and above the political fray. Let me also say that on page 11 of that speech His Honour tells us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is instructive to observe how far behind this country is on issues such as this when compared to Canada&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and he is talking about another matter now&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">with its Charter. In this country a Bill of Rights is anathema to most conservative lawyers and politicians and quite a few on the Labor side of politics.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What is a judge, who is still a sitting judge on a bench, doing by engaging himself in a major political debate as to whether this country ought to have a bill of rights or not? In fact, that was tried as a referendum some time ago, albeit as a limited bill of rights, and was overwhelmingly rejected by the people of Australia. I think that that course of conduct by a judge is most unwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that disturbed me deeply was in this same speech at page 16, where His Honour commented on a first instance decision of 1983 known as L and L, which suggested that a court faced with a homosexual applicant should consider a checklist of factors. I will not delay the Senate with what those factors ought or ought not be, but he then goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Interestingly, the correctness of the L and L approach has not been the subject of a challenge before a Full Court.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And then, wait for this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot say what a Full Court would do with such an issue, but I would hope that the passage of years and the resulting change in community attitudes would be reflected in the Court's consideration of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Basically he is saying right up front, `If this matter comes before me or any of my brother or sister judges on the Family Court of Appeal, I would hope that they would make a different determination.' Any person who would then be in the position of appealing such a case to the Family Court would undoubtedly think that they had a head start, and the opponent of such a case would realise that they were behind the eight&hyphen;ball right from the beginning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think I have set out enough examples where the judiciary have let themselves down. I plead with the judiciary to stay out of politics. Having said that, I trust that this country can return to a proper separation of powers, where judges stay out of politics and where the politicians do not make the sort of adverse criticism of our judges that we have witnessed over the past year or so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are many people in this country at this point in time who are rather vexed by the fall in the stock market&mdash;not just this stock market, but a number of stock markets around the world. I do not intend to come before the Senate today and say, `I told you so,' but there are a lot of commentators who have been saying that a stock market correction has been long overdue. I am of the belief that the correction which we are seeing has, in fact, been long overdue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What worries me is that many of the people who invested in the stock market were perhaps unaware of the savageness with which the market can correct itself. For example, the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong eight days ago was standing at 12,403.1 points. Yesterday, it closed at 9,059.89 points. In other words, it was 17 per cent down on where it was a week beforehand. There have been similar falls across other markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that there have been substantial falls in some markets versus where they were on 1 January. For example, the stock market in Hong Kong has lost 31.3 per cent of the value it had on 1 January. The Australian stock market is down 13.9 per cent on where it was on 1 January.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is appropriate for us to ask: what is the cause of this stock market volatility? If this was all reasoned investment based on the fundamentals of the companies in question, then one would doubt that there would be huge swings and lurches in the stock market. What has in fact happened is that we have seen an enormous amount of speculation; not investments in the companies in the hope of getting a return in the way of a dividend, but investments in the companies in the hope of getting a capital gain. Where has all this money come from? That is the question we have to ask ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In large part, the money which has been gambled on the stock markets has resulted from the excess money that has been in the superannuation funds. Why do I say that? A couple of years ago I did a survey which showed that the stock market, if you took all of the new issues coming on to the market, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> could only absorb between one&hyphen;quarter and one&hyphen;sixth of the new moneys paid into the superannuation system in that same 12&hyphen;month period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, honourable senators will know that the new capital raisings are not all available to the superannuation funds. Some will be rights issues and so on, so that they cannot all be taken up. So what you have is a situation where there are excess funds in the superannuation system, and they are literally being punted on the stock market and demand is driving up the prices of the shares to unrealistic heights. One only has to look at the price&hyphen;earnings ratios of some of these shares to see that the fundamentals were not backing up the investments that were being made. On top of that, we now have a low growth environment and, on top of that, we have seen a collapse of the South&hyphen;East Asian bubble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are certain things that can be done to protect against one's nest egg being at risk on the stock market. I am very glad to see that we have been joined by the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, because&mdash;</PARA>

But I want to single out Senator Kemp for particular praise because Senator Kemp will recall that about four or five years ago he and I were campaigning for retirement savings accounts. One of the reasons we campaigned for retirement savings accounts was so that people could shift their superannuation savings out of the stock market and into a more secure environment. That, I believe, is important. And I believe that this stock market crash vindicates, Senator Kemp, the stand that you and I, and others on this side of the chamber, took when we were in opposition, because that is very important.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Mackay interjects that it is a bit of a long bow. It is not a bit of a long bow. The facts are that somebody who plans to retire next year, or this year, unless there is an equally sharp 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8342"> upturn in the stock market, will find that they do not have the money in their superannuation that maybe they had been expecting to have. This stock market correction will affect many people who are close to retirement age who had, for whatever reason, left their funds with superannuation funds that had invested heavily on the stock market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another problem as well. I believe that we have a structural problem. The structural problem is that we have too many superannuation funds. I believe that we would have been better to go the Singaporean route. That decision has been very much made for us, and it is very difficult to unscramble the egg. But if we had taken a route where we said to people, `We expect you to make a higher rate of contribution, get a lower rate of return, but your savings will be guaranteed so that what is there today will definitely be there tomorrow, and maybe a little bit more,' then we would not find this problem where people's savings have been so heavily savaged by the corrections in the stock market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe what the government now needs to do is give consideration to whether it is a good idea to have hundreds of superannuation funds out there competing with each other, replicating administration costs, replicating promotional costs. Or maybe, when we talk about the contributions that people make from their own wages as opposed to the contributions that employers make on their behalf, it might be a good idea to put those funds into a lower risk, lower growth, centralised superannuation system so that they can quarantine a portion of their superannuation contributions from corrections in the market, and ultimately we will ensure that fewer people are hit as badly as many soon to be retired people will be hit by this correction in the stock market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My prediction is that there are many people who would like to retire at the end of this year or next year and who will now defer their retirement because of the correction in the stock market, because their superannuation nest egg is not what they want, and that will have consequences for unemployment. I believe we now need to look at the superannuation system as a whole and try to find

The government has said that residents in care prior to 1 October will not have to pay a bond to keep the place they are

The reality is that the fiscal position was very poor. This was despite the fact that Labor had promised time after time that the budget was in surplus. I need only remind the Senate of perhaps one of the most famous quotes&mdash;certainly one the Labor Party would prefer to forget; certainly Senator Cook would prefer to forget it&mdash;of Senator Cook in November 1995.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, Senator Alston. There are media reports today which say that the Labor opposition are now opposed to any further sell-down of Telstra, contrary to the position adopted in their draft policy platform, which provides for a further 16 per cent sell-off of Telstra. Do either of these policy positions commend themselves to the government? What would be the impact on Australia's international reputation if either proposal were adopted?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the short answer is that no, neither of these extraordinary propositions do commend themselves to the government. We do not want to be an international laughing stock. We are not prepared to allow our policy positions to be determined by the trade union movement. We are not prepared to hand over a veto, as clearly the Labor Party is prepared to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue first arose last week, when the cat was let out of the bag with the draft policy documents saying that Labor was prepared to retain Telstra in majority ownership. We then had a relaxed and comfortable shadow minister saying that Labor had no plans to further sell down, that the conference might approve the document and that the draft was no more than a statement of principles and did not suggest scope for a further sell down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is where he stood last week, until of course he realised that this was diametrically opposed to his clients' interests and that in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fact not only is his preselection under threat from the phone box minority in South Australia laughingly called `the Bolkus Left' but significant sections of caucus would not have a bar of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the absolute antithesis of leadership and policy responsibility. The Australian public want to know why you are not prepared to face up to the international reality. If you want to align yourselves with North Korea and Albania, that will not do. I can assure you that you will not get any support for that sort of approach in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We read in today's paper that Mr Beazley, the epitome of pusillanimous leadership, is now telling caucus that he would oppose any further sell down. This is the bloke who has never had the guts to come into this parliament and deny that he told Frank Blount on a number of occasions that he was more than happy to privatise Telstra&mdash;probably lock, stock and barrel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what has happened is that Mr Gareth Evans, who is desperately keen to get his hands on the money so he can fund a few election promises, went off on a frolic of his own without even consulting, presumably, Mr Beazley or Senator Schacht. What sort of a doormat do we have here? Here is the bloke who is supposed to be responsible for policy clearly having not the faintest idea that this was in the draft policy platform!

Poor old Senator Schacht clearly had no idea what was in the draft policy platform or, if he did, he is utterly derelict in his duty as far as the caucus is concerned because they will not wear it. So now he is getting up telling them he is going to draft a motion to be put to the conference ruling out any further sell down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is laughable. This is highly embarrassing for us on the world stage. Let us be perfectly clear about this: there is only one 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8346"> reason why Mr Beazley went to water, as usual, and that is that, if he had not said he was opposed to any further sell down, he would have gone to gaol, because the Telstra offer document, the form of which he approved precisely, said the Leader of the Opposition has stated that the Australian Labor Party is opposed to the further privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Leader of the Opposition has gone out there and told the entire Australian population that he is opposed to that, even though we know he is not, at the same time as his deputy has been out there trying to open the door&mdash;presumably to renovate the policy and to be freed from the shackles of the trade union movement, but more likely to get his hands on some billions of dollars&mdash;and is sitting there hoping he will get away with it and no-one will notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happens? They both go to water as soon as it sees the light of day and Senator Schacht clearly finds himself in an utterly untenable position.

I was making the point that that is why France can make claims within these negotiations that basically it creates energy through a lower percentage of fossil fuels. But I presume Senator Lees is not advocating that Australia convert to nuclear fuel, firstly, because of the cost of doing so and, secondly, because there is another waste issue involved in it, which is certainly not a greenhouse issue. But the environmental picture does not just involve greenhouse gases; it involves other consequences as well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Correct, is it, Senator Woodley? So you start to rule out the other alternatives, Senator Woodley. You are learning how this works. Certainly there is greater opportunity for the use of natural gas in Australia, but it is to date a much more expensive alternative. Somebody has to pay the cost difference and that has an effect upon GDP growth and therefore upon jobs. We want to encourage the development of the gas market so there will be greater competition from natural gas, and that can contribute to a better greenhouse outcome as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, there is the additional factor that, if we can reduce energy consumption or reduce it from business as usual, there is a greenhouse gain, and we accept that. That is why we have had a voluntary program, particularly with industry, to reduce energy consumption on a win&hyphen;win basis. It is good for the environment and it is good for their

Also, that is why we are going to be soon announcing further domestic reforms&mdash;as I have said to you, but you have ignored&mdash;which will require even greater effort from the Australian people to reduce their consumption of energy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill. Having kept our commitments to privatise one&hyphen;third of Telstra and use part of the proceeds to establish an environment rescue package by establishing the Natural Heritage Trust Fund, will the minister inform the Senate as to the progress of the $1.25 billion trust; in particular, the response from community groups in Victoria and what the Victorians can expect from the Natural Heritage Trust this financial year?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="8354" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator, certainly the contrast is there&mdash;quite stark&mdash;between this government and the ALP. The ALP claimed that it would not privatise public concerns such as the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas and the like but, of course, it immediately reneged. I suspect we are seeing the same occurrence, unfortunately, in relation to Telstra at the moment. Mr Beazley says it is not the intention of the ALP to further privatise Telstra. Yet there is an item on the agenda of the national conference to enable him to do so. It sounds like the same rock solid promise that we have heard before from the ALP.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, we have kept our promise and we are seeking to sell one&hyphen;third of Telstra, and we are committed to providing the capital funding for the Natural Heritage Trust out of that money. Under that anticipation we are, as you have indicated, currently making grants to community groups, in particular, to enable them to get on with the task of reinstating the health of Australia's natural environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therein lies another contrast between our approach to environmental matters and that of the ALP. We on this side of the chamber believe that the solution really lies in the hands of the community, the best way to respond is therefore for government to support the community in its efforts and you will get the best result in terms of environmental 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8355"> bottom line. We have very much structured the trust program to achieve that objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that light, we have already been able to indicate that we can support more than 1,000 projects worth $63 million in South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia. What is more important, and consistent with what I have just said, is that the community applications account for more than 60 per cent of the successful projects. Victoria, which is the state you particularly mentioned, Senator, is in line for at least $33 million this year in trust funding. Last Friday we announced 416 successful projects worth $23.8 million, and of these 266 were from community based applications for projects across the state of Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">South Australia will receive at least $24 million from the trust this financial year. I recently announced the first instalment of some $15.7 million for 309 projects from across my state. What is pleasing is that 239, or more than 75 per cent of the successful projects, were from community based applications&mdash;a total of some $7.5 million. In Western Australia, 336 projects will receive $23.5 million, with 210 of such projects coming from community based applications. Once again, this is just the first instalment for the state of Western Australia, which is expected to receive at least $30 million in this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are hopeful that New South Wales will be signing up to the trust this Friday and that Queensland will do so next week, after which we will be able to give similar good news to the community bodies within both of those states that are seeking Commonwealth support to implement the environmental remedial programs to which they are very much committed. It demonstrates that this government is a government that keeps its promises, that it supports the community in solving environmental problems and that it will continue to do so until we can produce a better environmental outcome not only for this generation but for future generations.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of an answer given by the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) to a question without notice asked by Senator Gibson today, relating to the privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It would be apparent to everyone over the last week that Senator Alston has become the world's greatest expert on the Labor Party's draft platform on communications. I am glad he is an expert on something because, when you look through his track record, you can see why he is not concentrating on portfolio matters. After all, this is the minister who scabbed on his promise to maintain funding for the ABC. After all, this is a minister who back&hyphen;scuttled on his promise to continue Radio Australia. This is the same minister who let the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) roll right over the top of him and prevent a full public inquiry, as promised by Senator Alston, into cross&hyphen;media ownership. This is the same minister, the same pathetic performer, who could not even deliver the start to lunch session of the cricket, as his predecessor did. This is now the minister who has put off decisions on anti&hyphen;siphoning and on digital television, because he just cannot handle those portfolio issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But suddenly he has become an expert on Labor Party policy. He has made a big statement here today, as he often does, without one shred of proof, referring to the fact that Mr Frank Blount is willing to state that Mr Beazley said he would sell off all of Telstra. Come in and put your evidence down, Senator Alston, and we might believe you. Or walk outside the door and have it tested in courts. But do not accuse Mr Beazley of lacking the bottle to do so, when  you will not do that at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this is understandable in the context of Senator Alston's career, because he has never much understood politics. He is known in the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party as the `Melway man', because he got the 14th edition of the Melway street directory and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> covered the whole metropolitan area looking for a seat. He went down to Flinders and got rolled by Peter Reith. He went up to Kew and got done by Jan Wade. He even tested the waters, but Roger Shipton would not go in Higgins. You name it, Senator Alston has covered it. He covered more ground in Melbourne looking for preselection than I did as a cabdriver. He has never understood politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me explain the situation. The Labor Party is governed by its draft platform and by way of resolution. Those two factors govern a future Labor government. What the platform says is that we believe in majority ownership of Telstra, and that is exactly where we are at. We are not going to accept your definition of that&mdash;20 per cent, 30 per cent, 40 per cent, 50 per cent or whatever. The principle is that we support majority ownership of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In government, if we are successful at the next election, we will be governed over the ensuing three years by a resolution. That resolution will say, `A future Labor government will sell not one share more in Telstra than is being sold off by this government.' We recognise the reality that it is not possible as a future government to go back and buy back one&hyphen;third of Telstra. That is impossible. Once that gets down the track, that is absolutely impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Senator Alston comes in here, not understanding the relationship between platform and resolution, not even understanding the difference between draft platform and eventual platform, and he rabbits on. He is not a bad middleweight performer in the chamber, I acknowledge that, he is a good journeyman, but his trouble is that once he walks out of this chamber he does nothing. What does Senator Alston do as communications minister? He wanders down to the Murdoch farm for a weekend. He does not even get to meet the big players now. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) does that. So he does absolutely nothing.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has now become the resident expert on the Labor Party. He does not worry about digital television or anti&hyphen;siphoning or cross&hyphen;media ownership&mdash;even though these are the things we are paying him to look after. They are all put off into the never&hyphen;never. All Senator Alston is worrying about is that the Labor Party is going to win the next election&mdash;and he basically concedes, by the way, that it will. He is absolutely terrified. He is talking about what we are going to do when we win the next election. I would not think the Prime Minister would be too happy with such an early concession.

Yesterday, on this same issue, I listed&mdash;and it would take more than five minutes to list them&mdash;this minister's range of broken promises, as significant as they are. There is the $55 million cut to the ABC budget, although he had promised on election night that it would be maintained; the promise that better communications would be maintained; the cuts to and destruction of Radio Australia, although he had promised that it would be maintained; and the promise that he would hold an open public inquiry into cross&hyphen;media ownership rules.

He is doing nothing at the moment&mdash;absolutely nothing&mdash;and when he does get around to doing something, he breaks another promise. His only activity now&mdash;he thinks he is rather smart and maybe politically slick&mdash;is to try to find ways to stand up in the Senate in question time and attack other political parties in a typical, low&hyphen;life barrister style, as though he was representing landlord racketeers in the Prahran Magistrates Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the style this minister has, and that is what he thinks is very good parliamentary performance. But when you get to his ministerial performance it is one of the worst of any minister. His only achievement is the corrupted vote of Senator Colston on the privatisation of Telstra. He offered a $16,000 salary increase to Senator Colston and the deputy presidency of the Senate. That is his only achievement. When we asked him questions about how that was achieved and whether he knew about letters that Colston staff member Christine Smith wrote and so 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8360"> on, we saw an abject backdown&mdash;a very cautious comment about his involvement when Christine Smith withdrew her letter saying that she was responsible for the problems that Senator Colston had in his travel arrangements. That is this minister's only achievement: a corrupted vote. Everywhere else he has broken every significant promise, and that is why he is a hopeless minister. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to be part of this debate. I must say that Labor led with its chin by asking the Senate to take note of the very sensible answer given to a question asked by my colleague Senator Gibson of a very capable and competent minister, Senator Alston. Senator Alston's answer today&mdash;and, indeed, each and every one of his answers&mdash;shows why he and we are on the government benches and why the Labor Party languishes in opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Schacht enters the debate today having taken some five months to ask a portfolio&hyphen;specific question of Senator Alston yesterday and, as soon as he had his five minutes in the sun, he scurried out&mdash;as did Senator Ray. I must say that while listening to Senator Ray's contribution I got the distinct impression that, after he had thought it was a good idea and launched into it, he had second thoughts and so, as soon as he finished, he scurried out of the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the people of Australia know is that when Kim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, makes a promise to them, it cannot be believed. What was the most important promise he made during the last election? `The budget is in surplus.' What did we find? A $10.3 billion deficit. I ask whether those opposite honestly believe the Australian people will say, `Sure, Mr Beazley, and sure, Labor Party, we are going to trust you on this promise.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has made similar promises in relation to privatisation. It faithfully promised the Australian people that, after the sale of 49 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank, not a single extra share would be sold. In the words of Senator Robert Ray, not an extra one per cent of the shareholding in Telstra 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would be sold. That was its solemn promise in relation to the Commonwealth Bank, but what did it do? As soon as it gained another term in government it flogged the whole lot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what about another great Labor icon: Qantas? What was your attitude in relation to that? Hand on heart you said, `We cannot sell Qantas. It is a national icon.' But what did they do? Of course they sold it. And why did they have to sell it? Because the economy that they left to the Australian people was in such a mess that they needed the capital funds to keep their recurrent funding going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have said in relation to Telstra and, in fact, what we have done in relation to Telstra is to sell one&hyphen;third off and use that money to retire debt. That is a very responsible course of action, because if there is one thing I do not want to leave the children of this country with, it is a legacy of government&hyphen;inflicted debt that they, through their endeavours, will have to pay off. So I fully support what the government has done in relation to Telstra.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people recognise what the Labor Party's promises are worth and, what is more, the Australian Labor Party recognise that as well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the motion to take note of the answers given by Senator Alston. Senator Alston has come into the Senate today, as he has on numerous occasions, seeking to comment on the Australian Labor Party's processes and policies in regard to Telstra. What an expert this man is; what an extraordinary expert this man is! This is the man who gets rolled by his own backbench on a regular basis. This is the man who has got real concerns about caucus or, as the Liberal Party calls it, their party room. His concern is that he cannot deliver on anything. He cannot deliver on anything because he stands for nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This is the man who came into this parliament, after a distinguished career at the bar defending all sorts of people, as a wet. The great Liberal reformer he was going to be. It took him five minutes to realise where the numbers were&mdash;and this man of principle jumped ship. He jumped in, of course, with the dries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the man who has a long track record of supporting dubious causes in the name of what he sees as great reform. Do you remember the great reforms he had in regard to John Elliott? He was supporting John Elliott to come to Canberra to roll John Howard. He went on to support Andrew Peacock when he was the leader&mdash;for a little while. Of course, he supported John Hewson&mdash;for a little while, that is. And, of course, he supported John Howard the second time around against 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Alexander Downer. And now who does he support? Is it Reith or is it Costello? We do not know. We will wait and see. We will keep a real weather eye on what is actually happening in the Liberal Party, depending on where Senator Alston comes in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What he will say is that he is never disloyal. He is just never in the front row of support for anybody. As Senator Ray  quite correctly pointed out to us all, he is the Melways man; the man who likes to comment upon the operations of the Labor Party. But he is a man who has a long, distinguished career of doing shifty things in the Liberal Party&mdash;a record that goes back to his days in the Liberal Party as an apparatchik. Coming from a silvertail background, he has been able to find an easy path through the Liberal Party, in the days when it was fashionable to be a wet. These days, of course, it is fashionable to be a dry, and there is none more fashionable than Senator Alston, because Senator Alston does not stand for anything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Hill knows only too well, when he missed out on his opportunity to do over Senator Hill, he of course supports Senator Hill. You have got to get right behind a bloke to stab him in the back. That is Senator Alston's style. He is a man who covets the job of Senator Hill, but he is not a man to be relied upon in a close fight. As I say, in the classic, tricky, barrister style, always read the fine print when you are talking about Senator Alston. He is the man who told us before the election that he was the bloke who was going to maintain funding to the ABC. Again, read the fine print when it comes to Tricky Dicky Alston&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy President, you know that I do not get up too often to speak in this type of debate but I must say that if we ever needed proof of how effective Senator Alston has been, it is the fact that today we have got the heavies from the Victorian Left and the Right coming in here, such as Robert Ray and Kim Carr. The Victorians decided it was get Richard Alston day. What a pretty pathetic effort it is. Senator Carr is talking about the minister being rolled and not being able to deliver on anything. I have only got five minutes but, really and truly, Senator Carr, if you gave me the opportunity, I reckon if I went through the achievements of our Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts it would take me about an hour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind you that one of the things we have had to do since we have taken government in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the last 20 months is catch up on telecommunications&mdash;and that is one thing that Senator Alston has worked very hard at. I do not need to remind you that with the new Telecommunications Act 1997 we have caught up with the rest of the world and we have got a customer service guarantee for the first time. You had 13 years and what did you do about it? Absolutely nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of talk today about Telstra privatisation. The people of Australia know what the benefits of that one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra are going to be. We have got the Natural Heritage Trust, a $1.1 billion trust&mdash;the biggest amount of money that has ever been set aside for the environment in this country. In my own state of Tasmania, Senator Abetz, as you know very well we are starting to feel the benefit of that. We only just recently, through the good work of Senator Alston, have got the Tasmanian Electronic Commerce Centre being set up there, worth $1.5 million&mdash;a direct result of a part of that $250 million regional telecommunications infrastructure fund that came out of the sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of that increase and the upgrade of telecommunications in my own state, we were able to get the Ansett Call Centre in Launceston. That has provided jobs. It is the centre of the whole Ansett booking service right throughout Australia. They are the sorts of things that we need in our state of Tasmania and they are the sorts of things that Senator Alston has been able to achieve in a very short term of 20 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we look at the arts portfolio. I can remember as a member of the public works committee driving out year after year to have a look at the site for the National Museum. Who has now done it? Who fixed it? Who today launched the building of the new National Museum that this country has been looking for for so long? It was the minister, Senator Alston, right here in Canberra. Some $7 million was announced in the budget and the $133 million made available for the new museum was announced and launched upstairs today. If ever you wanted to pick on somebody, you could have picked on somebody else apart from Senator Alston.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8363">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Film and Sound Archive building is something that your government let slide for such a long time. I am pleased to see it is going ahead to protect the important things, the history of Australia in film and sound. It is all happening. What about the international telecommunications market that this government has been promoting? We are actually catching up with the rest of the world. On a recent trip to Ireland that I was lucky enough to be the leader of, we saw that one of the things they are doing in Ireland is realising they have got to be up&hyphen;front with technology.

One of the things we have achieved through the portfolio that Senator Alston so well looks after is better telecommunications in the bush. You ask the people out in the bush what has been achieved in the last 20 months. We are already three years ahead of Labor's schedule that they had for telecommunications in the bush. Indeed, 17,000 Australians with untimed local calls is one of the benefits that is coming up. You do not need to be told about the problems we have had. I think it is a credit and a compliment to Senator Alston that the Labor Party decided to come here today, pick him out and try to denigrate him, when in fact if you are looking for a successful minister in the Howard government, you would need to look no further than the minister for communications and the arts. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTRALIAN MEAT AND LIVE-STOCK INDUSTRY BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;Stock Industry Bill 1997 and associated bills, is to provide a legislative framework to facilitate the move from statutory to new company structures and operational arrangements, for the Australian red meat and livestock industry. The new arrangements are a major step forward, advancing industry towards management of its own affairs and importantly, increasing efficiency and competitiveness in structuring this industry to continue as a world leader. This reform is focused on the future needs of industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Background</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is committed to improving the overall international competitiveness of all Australian industry. We are particularly keen to do so in our important agricultural industries. Unless we continue to improve productivity and cost efficiency throughout the food supply chain, we will lose ground against our international competitors and will not be able to maximise our national wealth, export opportunities and value enhancing potential.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The meat and livestock industry earns Australia, on average, about 3 billion export dollars a year. We need to set our targets for achievement at a higher level. As a single agricultural commodity export earner for Australia red meat and livestock ranks third, after wheat and wool. The potential of the industry is considerable, however to realise this potential we need to deal with a range of inefficiencies including high costs in the processing sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1994, the Industry Commission inquiry into the performance of the meat processing industry confirmed the importance of achieving and maintaining improvements and competitive efficiencies. No one can contest these simple objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commission found that Australia was not able to capitalise on its comparative production price advantage because the industry's processing sector was operating at significantly higher cost levels than the processing sectors of our major competitors. The commission, at the time it put forward its report, found that Australia was losing market share in almost all its major export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not just these barriers in the processing sector which are impeding the meat industry's capacity to be competitive in world markets. Other costs associated with Australia's labour market, waterfront and quarantine and meat inspection processes, are also being addressed. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators will no doubt agree that we must have a vision for the future and that reform in these key areas is vital to the long&hyphen;term viability of Australia's meat and livestock industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government is tackling these necessary reforms and significant initiatives are already under way. For example, in the key area of industrial relations the government has put the workplace relations act in place and, as a consequence, award simplification test cases have been formulated for examination by a full bench of the Australian industrial relations commission. One of the test cases includes the meat processing industry and the particular issue of the tally system. The outcome of these cases will have particular importance for the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The response to the Industry Commission's 1994 report was the establishment of the Meat and Live&hyphen;Stock Industry Act 1995 which allowed for some institutional restructuring, particularly in relation to priorities and policy direction. The act was designed to commence the process of engaging industry to accept a greater role in self determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, in effect, takes the major final steps towards empowerment by providing the industry with a structure which offers ownership and management of its own affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Review of current arrangements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By the end of 1995 it was clear that beef producers were suffering from the effects of a major drought and other significant international market factors which forced saleyard prices down to very low levels with consequential reduced returns to producers. Furthermore other red meat producers and other sectors of the industry were also facing problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government instigated a review of the current institutional arrangements to determine if early action might address at least some of the meat and livestock industry's problems. To that end, a joint industry and government meat and livestock industry reform task force was established in 1996. The task force reviewed the structural arrangements, the financial management and operational effectiveness of the present statutory bodies. It also pinpointed key industry policy and program issues for early action by government and industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The task force found that market and industry circumstances had changed since the establishment of the Meat and Live&hyphen;Stock Industry Act 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The task force found that the current statutory arrangements, which had worked well in the past, needed to be adjusted to deliver what industry required for the future. Prevailing and future commercial realities demand a structure which can deliver more flexible and focused commercial programs and operations. A sense of industry 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8370"> ownership and deeper involvement by levy&hyphen;paying stakeholders is also required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Working from these findings, the task force report offered a wide range of recommendations based on two underlying principles. The first was that the meat industry in Australia must move towards a more self&hyphen;regulated, responsible and market driven operation. The second was that the role of government must move to one side, with a more clearly defined set of core functions for industry while at the same time improving strategic alliances with and within industry for the delivery of these functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report also suggested that significant savings could be achieved by changing the current structures and levy&hyphen; funded functions and making the provision of services fully contestable and transparent to the industry stakeholders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the report advanced proposals for government on joint industry/government policy and program actions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These proposals cover a broad range of joint actions that in large part cross state/Commonwealth responsibilities and those of industry. Many aspects of these proposals are already being addressed by commonwealth and state agencies, in direct consultations with industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of recommendations were made on the need for uniformity in regulatory legislation and administration across Australia. A whole of government approach is essential to ensure an integrated and consistent basis for meat safety and other regulations and provide a national regulatory underpinning for industry driven quality assurance and self&hyphen;regulation schemes. My colleague, the minister for primary industries and energy, the Hon John Anderson, intends to continue to advance these issues with his colleagues on the agriculture and resource management council of Australia and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New arrangements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government decided on new arrangements following extensive consultations with all parts of Australia's vast and divergent meat and livestock industry. Full consensus has not been possible and is not possible. In an industry as diverse as this one, this is not surprising. I am pleased to say, however, there is broad agreement on major issues and each sector is in the process of implementing the changes sought. These included the need for a non&hyphen;government, commercially based organisation; the necessity for industry to manage its own affairs; a more hard headed approach to how levy&hyphen;payer monies are spent; and separately accountable beef and sheepmeat marketing and promotion divisions 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and separately accountable research and development divisions, within a commercially based organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another key area of agreement is that joint industry functions such as research and development, food safety and quality, market intelligence and market access issues, animal health and welfare, crisis management, eating quality standards, and Ausmeat should be dealt with co&hyphen;operatively and collectively, and be adequately funded and serviced. The industry is now focused on their collective responsibility in scoping projects and programs within each of the joint function areas. This is fundamental and very important.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new structures will consist of a new producer owned service delivery company, limited by guarantee under the corporations law, to provide a range of services to the industry including professional guidance. The role of the company needs to be recognised, more so than the fact that it will be producer owned. The company will replace the statutory authorities of the Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;Stock Corporation (ALMC) and the Meat Research Corporation (MRC).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The company will be accessible to all sectors within the industry in every sense, including service delivery, professional guidance and advice. All sectors will independently enter into contracts with the company for specific services. Importantly, the company will be a fully professional organisation which will be able to develop initiatives and proposals and advise industry and government on key issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be separate companies, limited by guarantee, for the meat processors, livestock exporters and for the red meat advisory council, which I will discuss shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between industry sectors and government to ensure co-operation in the overall interests of the red meat industry. There will be a commitment to the principles of a meat industry strategic plan and collective activities under genuine partnership arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is designed to free the industry from the legislative constraints imposed upon statutory bodies. The new, privately owned structure will allow industry to take appropriate steps towards:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Increasing industry's role in self&hyphen;determination and self&hyphen;regulation, in a commercially oriented environment;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Enhancing industry's capacity to determine and address areas of market failure;</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8371">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Encouraging inclusion of all parties through willing partnerships, as well as separate contractual arrangements;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Improving industry co&hyphen;operation, principally through empowering industry leadership, with rapid development of sound policy decisions and co&hyphen;operative mechanisms;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Minimising government intervention while at the same time, ensuring continuing and appropriate representation, governance, accountability and crises management arrangements; together with,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Providing clear ownership by levy payers and non&hyphen;statutory contributors, and appropriate participation in decision making processes and resultant benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new arrangements will empower the industry peak councils to take leadership roles. The peak councils are expected to be as broadly representative of their sectors' interests as possible, bearing in mind that there will always be dissenters and detractors of any systems put in place. Under voluntary systems, it is rarely possible to have full representation. Members of each sector should seek to make their views and concerns known to the peak councils. It is the responsibility of each and every participant of the industry to make their views known and seek to influence industry representation where appropriate. A requirement of what we are doing is that the relevant representative bodies be open to all views and embrace genuine representative responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Peak councils will carry responsibility for decisions on levels of levies and non&hyphen;statutory funding for the new service delivery company. They will be responsible, among other things, for the development of their sector's input into the meat industry strategic plan and for the implementation of that plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To be able to effectively carry out the new responsibilities which will be required of them, the peak councils will need to be adequately funded so that they can have access to the professional expertise they will require. A primary new source of funding for peak councils will be income earned from investment of industry reserves. We must approach this issue, practically and sensibly, according to the needs and responsibilities of each sector or agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `Red Meat Advisory Council', which may operate under another name, is primarily to provide advice to government on issues affecting the whole of industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed that the advisory council be incorporated as a company limited by guarantee with directors being the chairs of each of the six peak councils who will be voting members, and representatives of the processor and livestock exporter companies who will be participants. It will also 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> draw, as appropriate and when required, on advisers from government and other involved expert areas of the industry. The framework in which the advisory council will operate will be agreed in the MOU. Its functions will include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">advice to the minister;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">custodianship of the MOU and the Meat Industry Strategic Plan (the MISP);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">co&hyphen;ordination and development of, and assessment of performance against, the industry strategic plan;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">being the trustees (within a deed of trust) for industry reserves currently held by the statutory corporations, and ensure the investment of these monies by a reputable and reliable trust fund manager;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">administer arrangements to fund peak councils including the distribution of funds (from investment of reserves) to peak councils;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provide an interface for resolving sectorial differences or problems in a way which does not adversely affect industry but in a way which promotes the image and purpose of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The terms of the council's custodianship of the industry reserves will be determined jointly by industry and government. The principal requirements will be that the funds be used for the benefit of industry as a whole, be managed transparently in a manner consistent with an industry developed strategic plan, and be based on accepted commercial practice. It is envisaged the returns on investments would be used, primarily to fund peak councils and, in a small part, to defray the costs of running the council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Levies, charges and other funding</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under present arrangements industry levies and charges primarily go towards funding the industry's three statutory bodies&mdash;the ALMC, the MRC, and the Meat Industry Council. Other agencies which receive funding from industry levies and charges, include the National Residue Survey (NRS), the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC), the National Cattle Disease Eradication (NCDE) program and the Australian Animal Health Council (AAHC).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new arrangements contributions will be sourced from various industry sectors, either on a statutory or a non&hyphen;statutory basis. The collection of statutory levies will still be based on the present system but with changes allowing for a transaction levy on sheep, lambs and goats to replace the livestock slaughter levy previously paid by processors, and a separate transaction levy component on grain fed cattle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transaction levy approach for sheep, lambs and goats was adopted at the request of a clear majority of industry whose submission met all of the  re 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8372"> quirements of the government's levy principles. A similar request was also submitted by the grain fed cattle industry sector for a separate cattle transaction levy. Again this submission met each of the government's levy principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing levy and charge imposition acts have been modified to provide for clear sectoral ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Processors and livestock exporters will contribute on a non-statutory basis. To accommodate the non&hyphen;statutory nature of the funding, the now separate processor and exporter levies will be set at zero, provided these sectors meet their share of whole of industry obligations under the new arrangements. There will be no changes to current levy rates until the new arrangements, including formal agreement on the nature and extent of processor and livestock exporter contributions, are fully in place and contractually deliverable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should the non&hyphen;statutory contributions by processors and livestock exporters fail to meet agreed funding levels for joint industry functions, and as specifically agreed by these two sectors, the government has their prior agreement to maintain levies at a required level to ensure there is adequate funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The buffalo industry sector has chosen to use RIRDC to meet its collective research and development programs and will not be contributing to the new service delivery company. Separate levy legislation will provide for direct buffalo industry sector contributions to RIRDC, and continued contribution by this sector to the NRS and NCDE.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will continue to match industry r&amp;d commitments. Matching funds will continue on a dollar for dollar basis on eligible expenditure up to the maximum matching of 0.5 per cent of the industry's gross value of production. However, to qualify for matching funding for levy monies, contributing groups will need to meet specific eligibility criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MOU and deed of grants</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill recognises that much of the prescriptive detail for flow of levy funds and management of reserves will be set out in a deed of grant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The deed of grant will be implemented between the government and the producer owned service delivery company. The deed will set out the conditions upon which levy monies and matching funds are passed to the company and how those funds may be applied. It will also set out the minimal accountability requirements that enable the minister to meet his responsibilities under the Audit Act 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The MOU will primarily be between industry peak bodies, and also the government. Where appropriate and where they have identified responsibility the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> service delivery company and other entities will be required to be signatories. The document will consist of a statement of principles and supporting schedules, clearly outlining the new arrangements to which industry sectors have agreed. It will also outline intended joint function areas, core function areas and set out the guiding principles for the operation of the Red Meat Advisory Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Assets and liabilities</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In consultation with industry and appropriate central Commonwealth agencies, my colleague, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon John Anderson, will determine the most appropriate placement of the assets and liabilities of the ALMC and the MRC. The legislative provisions to effect the transfer of such assets and liabilities to private companies is provided for in the Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;Stock Industry (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the industry reserves will be transferred to the new service delivery company to offset liabilities which exist at the time of transfer and to meet start&hyphen;up capital requirements. A full due diligence exercise will be conducted for accountability purposes to ensure all assets and liabilities are identified prior to transfer. Start&hyphen;up capital will also be provided to the processor and livestock exporter companies. Minister Anderson will, in consultation with industry, determine how the balance of reserves will be used to benefit the industry as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Role of government, ministerial powers and accountability</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The role of government in the new arrangements will be minimal but will remain necessary while tax payer monies are involved. Ministerial powers of intervention and mechanisms to guarantee appropriate standards of governance and accountability to parliament and levy payers will be retained through the combination of legislation (including the corporations law), regulation, appropriation, deeds of grant and the industry MOU.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will not be a member of any of the new companies, nor will it have board representation or carry any liability in relation to their operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will, however, continue to fulfil its responsibility. The government will also continue to assist industry through working to ensure the economic framework provides for a genuinely competitive environment and that the global trading environment does not disadvantage our competitive advantages. The government will continue to maintain a strong presence in areas of food safety and hygiene, research and development, industry adjustment processes, training and education delivery, market access negotiations, competition 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8373"> and contestability, workplace reform, and infrastructure.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal bill makes provision for some staging (by proclamation) of implementation. This is critical, because many of the mechanisms which will underpin effective and efficient industry management, the creation of representative corporations, the development of industry contractual arrangements, and negotiations by industry leaders, must be completed before the current legislation is repealed and levies adjusted. These activities are well advanced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation provides for the continued management of existing export licences, export quotas and enforcement powers. At present these functions are managed by the ALMC and paid for by levy payers. They will now transfer to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, including the provision for full cost recovery for the administration of licences and quotas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision is made in the bill for the secretary of DPIE to have regard to policies formulated by prescribed industry bodies when exercising licensing and quota powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision is also made for levy funds, for marketing and promotion activities and r&amp;d functions, to flow to the new service delivery company. There is also provision for the government to identify those organisations which, after meeting prescribed conditions, will be recognised as eligible donors for the purpose of Commonwealth matching funding on eligible r&amp;d expenditure within the service delivery company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal legislation makes provision for ministerial direction, but only in situations of emergency and where the national interest is involved. The power of direction is limited to matters for which the Commonwealth has authority under the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new structural arrangements impact directly on other legislation, including the meat industry's present levies and charges acts. The Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;Stock Industry (Repeals and Consequential) Bill 1997 makes provision to repeal or amend relevant parts of the affected acts. In addition, a new set of levy and charge bills has been drafted to accommodate the change to the nature of future contributions. The changes are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Cattle Export Charges Act 1990 will be replaced by two new Cattle Export Charge Acts which deal separately with producers and exporters. This allows for subsequent reduction of the export sector levy components to zero, when that

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Live&hyphen;Stock Export Charge Act 1977 will be replaced by two new Live&hyphen;Stock Export Charges Acts which deal separately with producers and exporters. This will also allow for subsequent reduction of the export sector components to zero.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Live&hyphen;Stock Slaughter Levy Act 1964 will be replaced by a Livestock Transactions Levy Act and a Livestock Slaughter (Processors) Levy Act, to allow for the separation of producers' and processors' funding and for the processors' funding to move to zero levy rates.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the particular requirements of the buffalo industry will be met by new Buffalo Export Charge and Slaughter Levy Acts. Separate levy acts are needed because the buffalo industry will retain slaughter levy and export charge arrangements. Contributions from the buffalo industry will continue to go to RIRDC, the NRS and the NCDE, as at present.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Beef Production Levy Act 1990 will be amended to allow for the processors' funding to move to zero levy rates.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the new act replacing the Cattle Transaction Levy Act 1995 will provide for the imposition of separate levy components for grass fed and grain fed cattle producers to support their individual contributions to the new service delivery company, as well as continued funding to the NCDE and AAHC.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a revised set of National Residue Survey bills has been included in this package to allow for continuation of the provision of producer linked payments on cattle, buffalo, sheep, lambs and goats.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all cases, the promotion, marketing, r&amp;d and program specific components will be specifically identified. Provisions will ensure collections of levies and voluntary contributions relating to any particular sector will be clearly and transparently identifiable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Collection arrangements and cost recovery for these levies will remain as they are at present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National eating quality standards scheme</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minister Anderson has long promoted the need for a proper meat grading system. He expects the new service delivery company to maintain the high priority being given to the early introduction of the proposed national eating quality standards scheme and further expects funding for this initiative to be of a high priority for the industry sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Support for producers' marketing initiatives</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new service delivery company will be asked to give careful consideration to ways to assist 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8374"> groups of producers who wish to pursue various marketing initiatives. Such initiatives would include the development of brands and the development of niche markets and a means by which innovation and initiatives can reap rewards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I would like to repeat that the legislation package I have just outlined will facilitate the reshaping and refocusing of the Australian red meat and livestock industry. The new statutory arrangements will:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">empower industry;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">reduce government involvement;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">achieve a more focused and cost efficient service delivery;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provide a more responsive structure capable of adapting to rapidly evolving competition and customer needs; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">encourage the development of systems and structures which promote the culture of industry cooperation and a sense of corporate behaviour in developing and ensuring the future prosperity of the Australian red meat industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These new arrangements represent a radical move to industry self&hyphen;determination. The changes will be carefully implemented to ensure that structures, relationships and operations are corporate in their nature and have proper and workable settings and control measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the announcement of the government's decision, industry has had time to appreciate the historic opportunities being offered to it and acknowledged that the package will accommodate most, if not all, of what the various sectors have been seeking. All sectors have assured minister Anderson they accept the decisions taken and that they will get behind them to ensure their effective implementation. Above all, industry has recognised that the new arrangements are offering a necessary opportunity to bring about a fundamental cultural change. Rather than relying on government involvement and legislated instruments, the package offers industry control and ownership of its own destiny.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R267">Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Bill</XREF>  and the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R268">Snowy Hydro Corporatisation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997</XREF>  facilitate the corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains Hydro&hyphen;Electric Authority as agreed in 1995 between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian governments. The corporatisation thrust of this legislation has been agreed by those on this side when we were in government and we continue to support it now. At this stage I foreshadow, though, that the opposition will move an amendment in the committee stage of the bill. That amend 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment will be discussed in detail at the appropriate time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rationale for the corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains Authority is that it will enable the authority, under a new corporate entity, the Snowy Hydro Ltd, to participate fully in the emerging competitive national electricity market. This is an important advance in the move towards establishing a national electricity market and ensuring competition amongst energy suppliers. The establishment of a national electricity market has been pursued since 1990&hyphen;91 and was started by the Labor government. I can interpolate here, being a Western Australian senator, that it covers every state in the Commonwealth except Western Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have a lot of water over there&mdash;it is in the north&mdash;and we have a lot of natural gas, but our tariffs are a lot higher than for electricity generated by the Snowy scheme, which I think provides the cheapest electricity generated by any source in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nature of the Snowy Mountains Hydro&hyphen;Electric Authority is that complementary legislation is required to be passed by the Victorian and New South Wales governments. I understand that this is in the process of occurring. The Victorian legislation is expected to be passed by the Victorian parliament in the near future. The New South Wales legislation has, unfortunately, been blocked by the New South Wales upper house in the first instance. An amended version of the New South Wales legislation is expected to be introduced into the New South Wales parliament later this year or early next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The corporatisation of the Snowy is such that the Commonwealth legislation cannot be proclaimed until complementary state legislation is passed and an independent water inquiry on the water flow of the Snowy has been conducted. It is that aspect which goes to the heart of the amendment which I will move in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bills terminate the existing legislative arrangements in relation to the Snowy scheme 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8378"> and form a new company, the Snowy Hydro Ltd. The Snowy Hydro will manage and operate the Snowy mountains scheme and the Commonwealth and two state governments will have shares respectively in the new company. New South Wales will have 58 per cent, Victoria will have 29 per cent and the Commonwealth will have 13 per cent. The corporatisation will also seek to ensure that the Snowy operates on a financially viable basis in accordance with the corporate plan approved of by its members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to transitional arrangements, an issue that is always important on this side of the chamber, all current Snowy Mountains Authority staff will be offered a transfer to Snowy Hydro Ltd and no net loss of their benefits or their entitlements will occur. In addition, the corporatisation process will enable the facilitation of repayment of substantial debt owed by the Snowy Mountains Authority to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, the opposition will support this bill, but I do foreshadow an amendment. I must say, as someone who in a previous parliamentary life had ministerial responsibility for the Snowy Mountains Hydro&hyphen;electric Authority, I hope all of these changes can result in the authority being able to develop some capital investment to upgrade some of its operational needs, particularly on the power generation side. Some of the turbines have been maintained in a way which is a tribute to the ingenuity of Australian engineering. With that commercial for some capital investment in the scheme, can I say that we will support the bills.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is apparently happy to wash its hands of the most important river system in the country&mdash;and also of one of the most degraded rivers we have, the Snowy River, thanks to the fact that it now effectively has no water in it. The government is saying basically, `Don't worry about that, the states will look after everything.' What does this government believe is important enough for it to maintain an active interest in? If this is not an issue that the Commonwealth feels it should maintain an active decision&hyphen;making role in, what is?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we all know, we live on the driest inhabited continent on this planet. But it seems that, for this government, water use, water allocation is a secondary issue to the making of money through, in this case, hydro electricity; and that really it is not an issue for the interest of the national government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is shamelessly aware that both the New South Wales government and the Victorian government are preparing to privatise their shares of the Snowy scheme. He has, in fact, indicated that the Commonwealth will consider selling off its 13 per cent share. I think one of the reasons given was to `simplify the governance' after the scheme has been corporatised. All of this, without any idea as to how the final water allocations will work out!</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8379">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation does contain corporatisation principles, but it does not safeguard community or environmental concerns. All is pinned to the water inquiry that is yet to be agreed to and commenced. Here is the legislation before the Senate, with the government apparently&mdash;and, as I hear now, also the opposition&mdash;happy just to let it through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public is being asked by the federal government to accept a corporatisation package that leaves out the most important details. On top of this, there is no provision in the legislation for the federal government to have any responsibility for the Snowy River Alliance once agreed to: no responsibility for the environmental flows, no responsibility for the affected rivers, passing it all over to the states to look after it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, New South Wales and Victoria have to be very closely involved in the process of looking at, first of all, the licences but, in particular, the whole issue of corporatisation. But we have got it around the wrong way. Let us first get all the interested parties together, sort out what we are doing with the water, and then sit down and look at the pros and cons of corporatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister claims that he does `place a high priority on ensuring that arrangements to corporatise the scheme recognise the community interests in the future of the Snowy scheme'. But how, Minister, will you ensure that this happens, if you are effectively passing it all over to the states? We do have the power to say no to corporatisation until the outcome of the water licence is determined. But, obviously, with the opposition supporting you, that will not happen here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just like fellow senators to consider for a moment in particular the fate of the Snowy River. There have been many concerns raised about this river for many years, and I just bring a few to the attention of the Senate today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Total Environment Centre in New South Wales argues that the federal government should not allow its desire for maximum sale price to affect the environmental flow outcome for the Snowy River. If it is sold for less, then the other side of the coin is that it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is really an investment in the health of the river, and in a potential job creation scheme. The centre points out that additional jobs will not come from corporatisation but from expanding tourism along the restored Snowy River. This could be an opportunity, indeed, for the New South Wales and federal governments to work on an invigorated ecotourism plan for the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Conservation Foundation has stated that they:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . regard the Snowy River as a litmus test of Government policy on river health&mdash;to returning water to stressed river systems and restoring them to health. Without major increases in flows, the Snowy River is doomed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They look at the Snowy scheme itself and comment that it is a scheme that has profited from running the Snowy River dry, and it is now time to repay the environmental debt ahead of the Commonwealth's financial debts and return the Snowy to health. The snowy mountains hydro was built and has operated under the Commonwealth act and it has virtually destroyed the Snowy River in not much more than 30 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Presently, the diversion of the Snowy River inland is shared equally between the Murray and Murrumbidgee rivers. However, without restrictions on the equal release of water, there may be opportunities to divert larger quantities down one side. More importantly, if we look at this legislation, the potential to change the timing of these releases during the course of a season can affect irrigation entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if the primary objective is to make money, and water is needed for hydro electricity, how will the needs of the rivers, particularly the Snowy, of irrigators, of inland communities be dealt with? We need to have all of that organised first&mdash;to know the timing, to know the volumes, to know where the water is being allocated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victoria National Parks Association believes that the proportion of water from the Snowy River diverted to the Murray and Murrumbidgee rivers should not be increased&mdash;indeed, it should be reduced. Any water savings made from upgrading irrigation schemes should go back to restore the Snowy 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8380"> River flow&mdash;and I certainly agree with the association wholeheartedly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the federal government passes this legislation prior to the detail being worked out, then it will be automatically supporting any decision that New South Wales and Victorian energy and treasury ministers make on water resources and on the management of this system for the next 125 years, which is the term of the licence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the construction of the Snowy scheme, flows to the Snowy River just below Jindabyne Dam have been reduced to less than one per cent of their natural flows. The Snowy Mountains Hydro Power Act 1949 did not allocate any water for the Snowy's environmental requirements at all. Thirty&hyphen;odd years of this has virtually destroyed the Snowy River and as a result this Australian icon has become a narrow, weed&hyphen;choked stream virtually devoid of native species and indeed aquatic life at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Snowy scheme was originally planned as an engineering undertaking and only limited, if any, consideration was given to a wide range of community needs and to the likelihood and pattern of environmental changes. Surely in 1997 we know better than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community based group, the Snowy River Alliance, has seen what the bottom line of the argument is against passing this legislation now. They believe that the new legislation must allocate adequate environmental flows to the Snowy River and that this must be done prior to consideration of corporatisation. I will quote from one of their documents:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if the parliament passes this legislation before a decision is made between the states, then the parliament has rubber stamped any decision that the states might make.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Placing the control of a large section of south&hyphen;east Australia's water in the hands of a corporate entity will result in the interest lying with the maximisation of profits through power generation and not with environmental issues. Both the ACF and the Snowy River Alliance have expressed concern for the cost to taxpayers in the future if we wake up and find that we really have damaged these rivers 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to such an extent that we have to change the licence allocations in years to come. I will quote from the alliance which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there is going to be compensation involved, we believe that there will be a great reluctance by governments to alter those arrangements. Given the length of the term of the licence, it would be quite foreseeable to see a situation in ten or twenty years time, where there needs to be significant changes in those arrangements. That could mean that we will be paying the Snowy Hydro, which could be privatised by then, compensation for over 100 years.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Local residents, supported by environment groups, have been saying that there should be a restoration of flow to the once mighty Snowy below Jindabyne to enable the ecosystems at least to survive at a tenuous but possible level in the Snowy River. In June a group of local residents on foot and horseback protested outside Parliament House in New South Wales when the analogous legislation for corporatisation was before the New South Wales parliament. It was notable that the New South Wales Premier, Bob Carr, did not come out to speak to that group of people. In the coverage of that protest by Snowy Mountains and Snowy River residents this was said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Snowy Mountains Hydro&hyphen;electric Scheme diverted water flow into the Murray and Murrumbidgee irrigation schemes in 1967, the flow has dwindled to less than one per cent of the original flow, Snowy River Alliance chairman Paul Leete said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The trouble is, they took the lot. They wiped the Snowy River clean off the map . . . (Scientists) all say that if we don't get at least one quarter of the river back then we might as well get the liquid paper out and wipe it off the map."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Leete and about 40 fellow protesters, several of them on horseback&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">as I have said&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">invited the Premier . . . to accept a framed photograph of the Snowy River before the flow was halted.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was not possible because the Premier ducked the protest. However, veteran actor Gus Mercurio was at the protest and, as the report goes on:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It's choked with weeds. It's a shrivelling, little meaningless creek held together by pools . . . The Snowy that I and thousands of Australians once knew is in its death throes."</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ms Stewart, who said she was born on the river's banks where her ancestors had spent much of their time, said camping there had been a central part of daily existence.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it is, there is an amendment from Labor which concerns the holding of the water flow inquiry&mdash;and what a remarkable thing; we are being asked to pass this bill before the results of an inquiry into the need for returning flow to the Snowy River are available, before that inquiry has been held. However, Labor has an amendment flagged before the Senate which would enable the minister to act on the results of that inquiry. The minister, it turns out, is Senator Parer, the Minister for Resources and Energy. So here we have an environmental outcome being placed in the hands of the minister for holding back the flow of the Snowy River, who sees this as an irrigation outcome.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8382">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have recently watched the environmental concerns of the minister in question regarding the mine at Jabiluka in the Northern Territory. I have noticed no great proclivity for understanding the concerns, social and environmental, of local Aboriginal people, let alone the sentiments of a wider nation about Kakadu National Park. So it would be quite foolish and  remiss for the Greens to accept that the same minister might have a different point of view, a different approach, a greater sensitivity, when it comes to the needs of the Snowy River. Of course he has not. That is absurd. Of course we cannot expect that anything but a greenwash will occur post-corporatisation as far as the flow of the Snowy is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And, of course, it will be the holy dollar which determines the outcome&mdash;not the needs of the river, not the concerns of the Aboriginal community and not the concerns of all those communities downstream of the scheme right through to the Victorian coastline. They are not going to rate when it comes to a corporate entity which is doing business and which is selling that water for money. We do not live in that sort of society and we cannot expect in this day and age that sort of outcome. We know from the behaviour of the minister, as I have just said, that we certainly cannot leave this in his hands. We would be very foolish to put the safety of the chookhouse in the hands of the fox.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make an appeal here to the Labor opposition. This is a matter of holding up a process of corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains authority, not the flow of the Snowy River west into other systems for irrigation or for the production of electricity. That will go on. This is an appeal to halt the process of corporatisation, and essentially the Commonwealth divesting the influence it has, until the environmental safety of the Snowy River is returned; until an adequate flow&mdash;and the scientists say 28 per cent is the minimum&mdash;is returned to this majestic river.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of months ago here in Canberra I watched film of the river as it was. I saw canoeists going down this remarkable, majestic river on the snow melt, on the spring thaw from the Snowy Mountains, back in the 1940s. It can only be described as stupendous: 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a fabulous experience, a life&hyphen;moving experience. Today, if you go to emulate that experience, you find, as Mr Mercurio said, a riverbed choked with weeds, a shrivelling little meaningless creek. If we as a nation cannot get this right, if we as a nation cannot return 28 per cent to nature, to the environment, to local residents, to the Aboriginal community&mdash;it sounds minimal to me&mdash;while 72 per cent goes to the other pursuits for which the Snowy Mountains scheme was put in place, what does that say about us?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we as a Senate&mdash;and I include particularly the Labor opposition in this&mdash;cannot say, `Let us stay the execution of the Snowy until we get the outcome of the relevant inquiry into water flows, till we know what we are dealing with. Let us put off this corporatisation and not divest ourselves of powers until we ensure that the health of the Snowy and the aspirations of the people who live along it are met,' what does that say about the Senate, what does that say about the parliament and, indeed, what does that say about the Labor opposition and its claim to be sensitive to social and environmental matters of this sort?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not hold out any hope with the government. I do not hold out any hope with Senator Parer. I do not hold out any hope even with government members who represent communities along this mighty river. But we have got the numbers in this place to delay this corporatisation until the river is spoken for and until those people are spoken for. So I make this appeal to the opposition to join the Greens, the Democrats and, hopefully, the independent component in this place so that commonsense, if not environmental excellence, prevails and we get the information from the water inquiry into the needs of the Snowy River for centuries to come. What is the basic flow, the minimum flow, the least we can give back to this grand river to ensure its health into the future? We should have that information before we throw away our ability to do the right thing by the river and the people who live along it.</PARA>

The Snowy system is of significance to this country. It is significant to the heritage and the folklore of the country and it is significant to people within the Labor Party because the Snowy Mountains project was something that was seen as being very much the brainchild of the Chifley government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very vital system. In the diversion down the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, it provides a lot of vital water&mdash;and down the Murray&mdash;enabling the existence of some significant irrigation areas and some significant irrigation systems. This system supports the maintenance in jobs of many thousands of people who live in vibrant, stimulating and interesting communities on the system&mdash;communities which contribute a significant, valuable input to the economic viability and wellbeing of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the Murrumbidgee system is Griffith, which is the centre of the area which produces the greatest quantity of wine in this country. I know that those from South Australia, Victoria and elsewhere are going to be absolutely aghast at this and not believe me, but the wine production of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area&mdash;particularly that of the Griffith area&mdash;is the greatest, by volume, in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wine produced in the area is of a standard higher than rough red or pretty rough white. Over the last few decades, the vignerons have worked very hard to improve their standards and they are now providing very important wines, both in terms of volume and of the blends their wines are able to be used for. They used to be known for their fortified wines, but that is no longer the case. They are now known for being able to provide blends for some of the top wines that this country produces&mdash;and we know that this country produces wines that are of international standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have a significant chicken industry down there. It would not be there if there were no water. The Bartter's enterprise is significant. The factory alone employs 1,500 people. We have the ricegrowers cooperative 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> down there. This industry was started by a Japanese gentleman who moved to the area around Griffith and Leeton. Now we are beginning to see Australian ricegrowers being able to export their rice back into places like Japan. That is of major significance to the economy not only of the area but of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of fruits are also grown down there. The orange industry is in a bit of a bad state at the present, and the government has got to do something to address the problems associated with that, but the area is productive and fertile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Around Wagga Wagga, Narrandera, Leeton and Hay we have some feedlots. These are not enterprises that are at all sustainable without an adequate supply of water. That is where the availability of water to those involved in the irrigation and farming industries on those valleys becomes of the utmost importance&mdash;not just to the valley but, as I say, to the whole country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been concerns on the part of the irrigators, and they are seeking a guarantee that in times of drought they can be assured some access to the flow. They recall that in 1983, during the previous El Nino when the drought was very severe, they were able to go to the then state minister, Terry Sheahan&mdash;whose actual electorate was Burrinjuck, which of course included Burrinjuck Dam and a significant part of the upper reaches of the Murrumbidgee&mdash;and negotiate with his department a sensible arrangement between all the major parties involved. They were able to ensure that, if the drought did not break before the end of the autumn, they would be able to keep a sufficient flow for the hydro to meet its water needs for electricity production for heating and power during the peak times in winter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also they were able to ensure that it was possible to tell the ricegrowers&mdash;halfway through the season when the season was particularly bad and the problems were becoming critical&mdash;how much water they could have on allocation over the next couple of months. While not getting the full amount of water they needed, they were able to get enough to enable them to get the crop off. It 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8384"> enabled them to remain viable in that district, and it enabled us as a country to have our exports and earnings. They still talk about it being a very amicable arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New South Wales is currently engaged in a review of water in that state&mdash;a review which is most important for the state, and, probably, for this country. The health, the use and the future needs of all the New South Wales water systems  are being looked at. For this  Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Bill  to be passed and proclaimed prior to that inquiry being completed would be the most ridiculous, stupid thing that could possibly happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is vitally important that the amendments that get passed make it very clear that no proclamation will take place until all the parties are satisfied. The electricity generators, the irrigators and the environmentalists need to be satisfied. This system is one that has to balance the needs of at least three major groups in our country. It is vitally important, therefore, that the amendments to be moved by Senator Cook get passed, because that is one way of ensuring that the legislation will not be proclaimed until after this has been sorted out&mdash;until after agreements and arrangements can be instituted and put in place such that there can be an equitable and fair distribution, to the benefit of all the players involved in this great river system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be absolutely foolhardy to ignore the work that the New South Wales Minister for the Environment, Pam Allan, and the Minister for Land and Water Conservation, Kim Yeadon, have undertaken in recent times, and are continuing to undertake with this water inquiry. It is certainly under way. Reading my local media it is quite apparent to me that the community is being involved. The community is being invited to participate and to have its point of view heard, and visits are being planned and public hearings and community consultation times have been set aside for all of the major river systems: the Darling; the Macquarie leading up to the Bogan and the Darling; the Gwydir area; down the Lachlan; and the Murrumbidgee and the Murray as well. So it is vitally important that nothing of this legislation be proclaimed until that inquiry has been completed, there 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has been a resolution and concerns have abated, and the three major groups have had an opportunity to have considerable input and reach agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the vital part of this issue: if this water is handled badly and the power generators get the vast majority, and get the overriding say, the other two groups are not going to be happy. They are not going to be satisfied and there are going to be problems. It is vitally important that such issues as how to handle El Ninos and major droughts&mdash;such as the drought of 1983 when Blowering Dam was empty and water had to be moved between two dams to keep the generation of power available&mdash;have to be resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has to be a balance struck between the needs of the generators, the needs of the irrigators, the needs of other farmers as well&mdash;because there are farmers who do not irrigate but who certainly rely upon the water for stock in particular&mdash;and the needs of the environmentalists for the water in that area. It is vitally important that all those needs are balanced.

I also believe that such privatisation or corporatisation will result in large, unrecoverable, negative consequences for the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the face of the almost certain passage of this bill, I want to be assured that the issue of the environmental impact is addressed as a part of its passage. For that reason, I am moving my second reading amendment which, if passed, would defer this bill until the environmental matters concerning the rehabilitation of river systems are resolved.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8385">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason why I oppose this bill is that the corporatisation is a mechanism to allow privatisation. Even corporatisation removes the ability of the public to act through government and the bureaucracy to manage the Snowy scheme in the public interest. It is part of the law. Corporate managers are legally bound to defend corporate profits and are not bound to defend social or environmental policy except as required by law. So if it is not specifically stated it is not available to corporate managers to impose something which might be considered a cost on their shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The corporatisation narrows the ambit of responsibility for management of the Snowy scheme. The corporation is seen primarily as an independent electricity generator in the national electricity market rather than having a role in water management. Yet it does retain high levels of control over water originally established under defence provisions to override state interests. The corporatisation gives the Commonwealth 13 per cent of stock, Victoria 29 per cent, and New South Wales gets control of the corporation with 58 per cent of the stock. Under normal corporate law, there is no requirement for a majority shareholder to consult or consider minority shareholders as long as it is not acting to the commercial detriment of minority shareholders&mdash;that is, as long as it is acting for profit maximisation. There is no way to guarantee that this means it must be of benefit to the environment or the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New South Wales is understood to want to include the Snowy shares as part of the sale of state electricity production assets. While we recognise that the privatisation of New South Wales electricity assets has been rejected by the rank and file of the ALP, it is also clear that the executive favours it and would not let it drop altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition would privatise in a moment, should they gain power. In such a case, the majority ownership of the Snowy plan would go to the private sector and entirely out of the public domain, except as a commercial investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no body which has been given the charge of regulating the Snowy scheme&mdash;that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is, the environmental impacts or the social impacts of the scheme&mdash;under New South Wales environmental laws. There has been some discussion of a Snowy scientific committee being given a role in integrated management, but there is nothing about that in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the issues that arise about the environmental management of the riparian ecosystems and the history of failure to consider the environment, I believe an integrated approach is required which represents the interests of both New South Wales and Victoria, as well as the Commonwealth as the body protecting our natural heritage on behalf of nature and of the wider public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there needs to be an administrative body with the specific tasks of regulation, oversight and assuring that measures taken in the interest of nature and people are enforced. I do not believe that the interests of New South Wales are necessarily equivalent to the interests of Victoria and the Commonwealth. In particular, I do not see how New South Wales environmental water and planning laws will deal effectively with environmental impacts of the Snowy scheme on rivers such as the Snowy River in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The primary objection I have to this bill is the fundamental one that I do not believe the interests of the people of Australia, of New South Wales or of Victoria are best served by taking the Snowy scheme out of direct public control. There are too many issues affecting the environment and people around the distribution and pricing of water resources, of power and the environmental impacts of how the scheme is run. I think that direct control through those who operate it is the best mechanism, rather than attempts to regulate a for profit corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The secondary objection I have is that there is no responsibility taken in this bill for the environmental issues. It is that objection to which my amendment is directed, and I note that Senator Brown has spoken to that already and Senator Lees has mentioned those issues in relation to the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government and the ALP will claim potentially that their amendment and their water inquiry are sufficient, even though the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8386"> legislation in its form will already have gone through. So basically the legislation will not take account of the findings of the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reference to the water inquiry, while dealing with water flows, does not have as any sort of reference the re&hyphen;establishment of water flow rates sufficient to see the environments of the river system re&hyphen;established. So we can assume that, no matter what happens, there is nothing to ensure that that will happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report may raise those issues, and they will certainly be realised during the inquiry, but it will not necessarily make recommendations to support the re&hyphen;establishment of such flows. It is really not an inquiry that even includes a brief to determine what those flows might be, though it is currently widely reported that they&mdash;and Senator Brown has mentioned this&mdash;are around 28 per cent of the original flow. Currently, the flows in the Snowy are only about one per cent of the original flow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am further distressed because the procedure being followed is again to pass a bill with known problems, with some indication or promise that after passage the problems will be examined and fixed. We saw that occur with the competition policy legislation, which was passed without any adequate treatment of what `public interest' meant and with no clear idea of what bills would be exempted. We were told that that would be sorted out in the future. The states were given a year to establish what basis they would use for asking for exemption and what community service obligations would be imposed. As far as I know, there is still no really clear notion of what constitutes public interest, and yet there are over 2,000 pieces of legislation throughout Australia&mdash;that is Commonwealth, state and local legislation&mdash;being reviewed as we speak.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the Snowy scheme, I do not think it is adequate to have an identified problem with a bill and then pass that bill on the condition that an inquiry will be held. The inquiry will make a report, present options and these may or may not be taken up in any final agreement.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you are doing is effectively removing the power of the Commonwealth parliament to have any effective input or review of this process. We do not know if the recommendations will be adequate and if what is agreed upon will be adequate to address the issues. We know that there are issues, and many, many people, especially in Victoria in the Snowy watershed, are concerned. We have no idea whether their issues will be addressed or addressed adequately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are being asked to pass a framework to create a problem&mdash;to create a problem, I emphasise&mdash;without being aware of any solution being offered and in a way that the parliament will never get to have input into that solution. This is not an adequate way to deal with such an important issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Snowy hydro scheme is an important issue. It covers a very large part of the watershed of the south&hyphen;east of Australia and many of our significant river systems. It is not just about electricity privatisation. It is not just about getting a quick payback for the Commonwealth by generating private sector debt or the sell&hyphen;off of an asset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My amendment would reverse the current process. It would say that, before corporatisation or privatisation are even considered, the environmental issues must be resolved and some means of assuring that regulation, oversight and enforcement be provided. This should be included in legislation. At that point, the parliament can examine the provisions and consider whether they are adequate and well formulated and whether changes must be made. I commend to the Senate my amendment,  which says that the bill should be withdrawn until that time. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issues of corporatisation, I would like to make a few additional points. One of the issues arose in respect of the hearings into competition policy. I mention that because there is so much about this which was brought up in relation to competition policy in respect of the whole issue of environment and public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the issues which arose then was in the submission of the Institute of Engineers. They made the point that one result of corporatisation and privatisation would be the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8387"> loss of intellectual capital and intellectual history, using the examples of the dams and water management. They pointed out that once that history and expertise is lost, as it almost certainly will be with outsourcing and contracting out of dam maintenance services, the result will be the loss of that engineering expertise from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is not big enough nor does it have enough dams&mdash;probably fortunately&mdash;to maintain a single contractor for dealing with the engineering issues of large hydro&hyphen;electric projects. The result the Institute of Engineers outlined would be loss of such expertise here and contracting out of such services to experts from nations such as the United States and Canada.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By far the biggest issue being raised is that of the effect of the current water flow practices into the riparian ecosystems, especially that of the Snowy River. From a major river system which was one of the significant features of the Australian continent, the river has been now slowed to a trickle. This is in a region which is relatively unrepresented anywhere else in Australia and hence anywhere else in the world. The Australian continent is biologically unique. We have huge numbers of unique species and in creatures such as the marsupials we have unique lines of biological development. This is due to our geographical isolation. Continental Australia is relatively flat and the only area of significant mountains is the Snowy Mountains. As a consequence, the ecological conditions in much of this area are not duplicated in other areas of Australia. This area is therefore a unique area in a unique continent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The plant and animal systems evolved within that area with certain river flows. Cutting off those flows constitutes a huge change to ecological systems and conditions. It affects plants and animals, insects and other creatures that depend on them directly and indirectly.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of the Snowy hydro scheme effectively closed off those river flows. From 1967 flows into the Snowy River dropped to about, as I mentioned, one per cent of the level they were before construction of the dam at Jindabyne.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result has been large changes in environmental conditions in that watershed. It has been estimated that you need about 28 per cent of the flow to re&hyphen;establish even the basis of the ecosystem. The changes that have occurred do not have an impact only on the Snowy Mountains, they affect the entire river system all the way down to Orbost. The environment at the very mouth where the river enters the ocean has been affected and the reduction in flow has meant massive sea salt incursions from the sea into what was a rich and diverse fresh water delta system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin Commission may have a role in the regulation of the Snowy scheme it is a somewhat marginal role in terms of its ability to argue that it can regulate the flows into the Snowy without being granted specific powers to do so. An example of the problem of corporatisation is that the corporation is seen as an electricity company, rather than as an integrated system manager. There is little or no consideration of either the ecological effects I have already mentioned or the management of the resource for irrigation purposes. There are no guarantees that the water flows to irrigators will be maintained and, once corporatisation occurs, there are no real mechanisms to address this other than the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin over&hyphen;irrigation means that rising salinity has already badly affected 500,000 hectares of some of the best land in the country. There is little or no way the Commonwealth can effectively regulate water use. The term of the water agreement granted to the corporation is 75 years with a 50&hyphen;year renewable option. The New South Wales legislation has, I understand, options for more frequent review&mdash;every 10 years&mdash;but this does not make the Commonwealth abrogation of responsibility more acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The terms of the corporatisation principles at the end of the explanatory memorandum extend the existing rights through a licence agreement which under defence acts allow the authority to effectively exert full control over the water. While there is some leeway for changing the current water regime most of the clauses, and indeed the inquiry into environ 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8388"> mental impacts proposed in the ALP amendment, refer to the existing or current pattern of water flows. These are inadequate to maintain the Snowy riparian ecosystems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to again highlight the proposed second reading amendment which is in my name because passage of the amendment will result in the bill being withdrawn until after an inquiry. An inquiry will be required to establish the flows required to re&hyphen;establish ecological viability of the Snowy ecosystem and to make what recommendations are necessary to ensure that such flows can be established and maintained. The recommendations and a mechanism to ensure that the environment oversight can be maintained and regulation enforced must be incorporated into any bill to corporatise the Snowy scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliament would then get to see the entire package before it removes the Snowy scheme from the sphere of effective and accountable public control. I have to repeat, because it is very important, that if the bill goes through without those measures in it then under the Corporations Law it becomes very difficult, if not impossible, for the public interest to be included in the way that corporation is operated.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think our amendment is the proper and responsible approach to dealing with this issue. If my amendment gets up the bill will be withdrawn. If it does not, I will oppose the bill. In principle, I believe that the control and ownership of the Snowy hydro scheme should remain in public hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is one of those issues, if we add it into the lot of what is happening in the government, that should be seen in perspective. Bit by bit the Commonwealth is withdrawing from nearly all aspects of environmental oversight in relation even to such things as world heritage areas. Not only has the Commonwealth not taken action on such areas as Shark Bay, for instance, but in fact as soon as there has been whatever agreement, adequate or inadequate; as soon as whatever action has been taken by the state governments like Western Australia; as soon as whatever has happened to hound species, whatever has happened in inadequate research, whatever has happened in inadequate reporting or whatever has happened anywhere, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it is considered by the government to be okay. As long as they get it off their hands, as long as they can turn their back on it it appears to be okay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Handing over holus bolus to states seems to be the only method this Commonwealth government has of dealing with the environment. I guess if I was to make a fairly sure assessment of the future I would say that as soon as the Natural Heritage Trust money runs out that will go hand in hand with the Commonwealth by that stage having got rid of just about every element of environmental oversight, even to do with the Commonwealth bills they are supposed to be administering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly hope by that stage that there is some sort of High Court challenge. I hope that, if not, there is a major debate within the community about the urgent need for constitutional reform to make sure that no Commonwealth government can act in this way again; that is, to pretend that the environment is not their responsibility and to pretend that they have no responsibility in Australia for those things such as ecosystems that straddle more than one state. There are issues of ecological sustainability and issues such as world heritage areas and species that they will not accept any responsibility for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More and more, people are believing that Commonwealth, state and local governments all have a responsibility. That is my firm belief as well. I believe it is only when these kinds of responsibilities are firmly entrenched as a right of citizenship&mdash;that is, that ecological sustainability is a right of citizenship in Australia, as it is in many other countries&mdash;that we will have an assurance that Commonwealth governments of any sort will take their responsibility seriously.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An officer from my electoral office and I took the time to travel down to the Snowy River to have a look directly at the environmental damage and degradation that has occurred as a result of not having environmental flows on that river since the dam was constructed. I endorse the observations made by previous senators about the state of that river. It is weed&hyphen;choked and it is dying. There is a golden opportunity for the governments of Australia to rectify this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to talk about the potential for rectifying this issue. We understand quite clearly that this process of corporatisation has progressed to a critical point. So I would like to backtrack slightly and look at the motivation as to why we would consider this window of opportunity to deal with the issue of environmental flows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, the act being amended presents the only window of opportunity prior to corporatisation for this issue to be addressed from an environmental perspective. Post corporatisation there will be very little opportunity, if any, as there is a direct correlation between an increase in the flows for the Snowy River and a reduced output for Snowy Hydro, which is the company to be formed once this bill is eventually passed&mdash;if it is passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Post corporatisation, there will be very little opportunity for any changes to be made to the flows. I am speaking from a very pragmatic 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> point of view. Of course Snowy Hydro would be able to make such a decision, but in the context of the way Snowy Hydro is being established, and considering its role, purpose and intent, I think due consideration of environmental issues is something that certainly is not likely to be at the forefront of its agenda and not of primary consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the motivations? Not only is there an opportunity for the Commonwealth to play a direct role in instigating and rectifying activities to enhance the environment of the Snowy River corridor, but also there are some economic reasons to do it. Regional development is one, which I will turn to. If environmental issues are not enough to motivate this government to take the appropriate action that is open to them through our amendment, if it is passed, then some of the regional development issues could be factored into their decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The whole area of the Snowy River beyond the dam is not exactly a thriving opportunity for local industry to develop. But an increase in Snowy River flows opens all sorts of opportunities, including ecotourism and the development of sporting and recreational activities downstream, in both New South Wales and Victoria. It also opens the doors to the consideration of building an agricultural industry based on the reintroduction of flows to that river. So it is too simplistic for this government to stick to its dry arguments about its motivation for not addressing environmental flows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning now to the water inquiry: we have heard about the mechanism that is provided through the water inquiry to allow the minister to play a role in determining the merits or otherwise of that water inquiry and, if you like, endorsing or otherwise its outcomes and its processes. This window of opportunity that our amendment provides for does just that. Although not too much of what this government has done gives one hope for such due consideration to be made, it does lock in a mechanism that will give the minister an opportunity to deal with this issue prior to gazettal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The water inquiry I think has quite a high degree&mdash;perhaps an undue degree&mdash;of focus 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8390"> in the context of the debate about this bill. There could have been a far simpler mechanism, which is this Commonwealth government insisting that that inquiry be completed prior to this bill being considered. But, failing that, the mechanism that we are providing for will provide such a process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to now turn to the role of the Commonwealth with respect to Snowy Hydro. It is a player in terms of the three governments that are involved in this issue. The Commonwealth's involvement in Snowy Hydro is one of great responsibility, and that responsibility will essentially be dispelled with the passage of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make some references to the report of the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee on this particular bill and in making such references turn to a quote that Mr Collis of Native Fish Australia made. He pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the state of the Snowy River has come about directly as a result of Commonwealth government activities. We see that the Commonwealth government has a responsibility to do something about that situation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">No&hyphen;one can argue with that statement. There is no doubt about that. The question I think here is whether or not the government will take up the opportunity to act in conveying a strong view about the water inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there is the opportunity under that water inquiry to determine that environmental flows must begin. That could in fact be a recommendation of that inquiry. I know from all the evidence that I have heard, through both particular Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee hearings and my dealings with Paul Leete from the Snowy River Alliance and all the other activists who have devoted a significant proportion of their personal time to solving this issue in favour of the river and the communities that live around it, that this issue is quite fundamental. They still see there is an opportunity for these flows to be allocated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The campaign of these people&mdash;and I would like to acknowledge particularly the work of Paul Leete through the Snowy River Alliance&mdash;has been one of passion and one of dedication, and they have had a high degree 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of commitment to what is a fundamental government responsibility. It really does pare this issue right back to the bare bones of what government is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth did initiate the Snowy River scheme and, because of this convoluted process of government responsibilities and proportional allocation of assets relating to the Snowy hydro&hyphen;electric scheme, we as a Commonwealth find ourselves in almost a legislative bind in terms of process and hence a quite disempowering process from the Commonwealth government in that the joint decisions between the Commonwealth and states are driving it. Hence the argument will no doubt be put by Senator Parer that this is not the Commonwealth's baby; it is something that is being driven at best jointly, at worst by the states, and something in which the Commonwealth is just a bit player.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that in this day and age such an argument holds any merit and that, in issues relating to the environment, environment protection and in this case restoration of the environment that is achievable through a government decision, any such ducking of responsibility is acceptable. I do not believe it is acceptable to the community and it should not be acceptable in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to put forward the view that the people who involve themselves in the water inquiry have to take the highest degree of responsibility for these considerations and should not see it as just an exercise that was negotiated to allow the passage of these bills and the progression of the corporatisation agenda. They should see it for what it is constructed to be under this legislation: a genuine inquiry into all matters relating to the water that flows through the Snowy hydro scheme, and that of course includes the environmental flows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be a great shame if that water inquiry were to be allowed to focus specifically on the economic issues relating to the flows coming out the other end of the Snowy hydro scheme, and not take into consideration the full environmental impact of not allowing the Snowy River to flow again through water allocations. I believe that the minister, Senator Parer, has a direct responsibility to make sure 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8391"> that that water inquiry addresses that specific issue in a thorough way, in a contextual way, with a strong environmental focus. I would go so far as to say that that environmental focus must begin to consider how to quantify how much we value a river. How do we put a price, an economic value, on something like that? It is very difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to see the minister make sure that this water inquiry take into their considerations these very broad issues, recognising of course that that single opportunity that is articulated certainly in our amendment to provide the minister with that opportunity is probably the last opportunity in the context of the corporatisation bill. If he fails in relation to that responsibility, and it is a pretty tough call for Senator Parer, he will be condemning not just the river but also the community that has grown around that river for the last however many years and has seen the degradation that has arisen as a result of the restriction of the flows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a report about the environmental flows. When we talk about environmental flows, we are talking about the restoration of about 28 per cent of the original water flows to the Snowy River. This figure is not arbitrary; it is based on a scientific study that has been presented before the committee and circulated well in the context of the consideration of this bill. At this stage the government has not shown any degree of interest in acting upon that particular study. But it has, through its statements as part of the inquiry and public statements, indicated that all such research will be considered as part of that water inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 28 per cent flows are what is required to restore the river to a minimum degree of flow that will strive to achieve some sort of ecological balance and sustainability for a river. Nonetheless, it still will be far diminished. In the preparation of that particular study and the activities once again of the Snowy River Alliance, a high degree of maturity, sensibility and practicality has been shown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Minister, it is obviously a situation of dealing with more than just a strung&hyphen;together community group. You are dealing with a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> group in the Snowy River Alliance who have taken the time to prepare their facts and figures, have had the opportunity to come before various committees as witnesses and state their case and have had the support of significant environment and community organisations who are concerned about the Snowy River. To disregard their evidence and not give it the status it deserves is as much an abdication of the responsibilities of this government as would be allowing the water inquiry to proceed without the factors being taken into account, as I have discussed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to make the point again about the Commonwealth's responsibilities. There was some discussion in the committee about section 100 of the constitution and the application of the Commonwealth jurisdiction in the establishment of the Snowy River scheme in the first place. I alluded to the convoluted nature of the way the states and the Commonwealth have had to negotiate the process to achieve corporatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, I believe, an anomalous situation. By the virtue of that fact, I think that strengthens the argument that the Commonwealth must take the highest possible level of responsibility in dealing with this, as the gazettal of this bill will remove the opportunity for the Commonwealth to ever have a say on environmental factors of the Snowy River. When it was established, there were no comprehensive environmental reports conducted and there is nothing on the record to explain or assess the potential impact of the Snowy River scheme in the first place. For that, we as the parliament and you specifically as the government have to take responsibility in the very first instance.</PARA></SPEECH>

This legislation does seem to have confused purposes. I am sure the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), with his intellectual ability, will be able to resolve the confusion in his usual lucid way. The attachment to the explanatory memorandum, as an introduction, says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8392">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority . . . and related aspects of the Snowy Mountain Hydro-electric Scheme (collectively the Scheme) by the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria is a significant national micro-economic reform initiative and is being undertaken in accordance with Council of Australian Governments commitments.The message that comes through there is clear&mdash;that this is a micro&hyphen;economic reform, that this particular bill is aimed at ensuring that Australia's economic wellbeing is forwarded. That would be consistent with attachment 1 to the explanatory memorandum, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal purposes of Snowy Hydro are to include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) participation on a commercial basis in the emerging NEM&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is the national electricity market&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as an independent electricity generator;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) participation on a commercial basis in any future developments and operations approved by its Board; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) meeting appropriate water arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A reading of that particular document would indicate that this is an agreement between Victoria, New South Wales and the Commonwealth to ensure that there is a commercial basis to the scheme and that the gross national product is going to be increased by the way that particular scheme is put into operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having read that, it would be reasonable to assume that the sooner this act is passed the better, because that is the basis upon which it would go forward. So why should there be any delay? That is if you look at the attachment to the explanatory memorandum. But when you go to the second reading speech, that does not seem to be the thrust. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The idea is not to bring this legislation into operation as soon as possible but to delay the coming into operation of this legislation for a considerable period.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Indeed&mdash;a period beyond six months. Mr Acting Deputy President, as you know, six months is the usual period that is allowed, the longest period that is allowed, before legislation comes into operation. Drafting instructions, for example, say that any legislation that gets the royal assent should come into operation within six months of that happen 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing. That is not the case with this legislation. So you say to yourself: why the delay in the time at which this legislation comes into operation? The answer probably lies on page 8 of the second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the broader level, the Council of Australian Governments agreed to a process for water industry reform in Australia at its meeting on 11 April 1995. Of particular relevance to the corporatisation of the Snowy scheme is the agreement by government that the environment is a legitimate user of water.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On page 21 of the explanatory memorandum the word `environment' is not mentioned. So a different concept is now introduced into the equation in the second reading speech. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments have taken these concepts seriously. A water inquiry is to be held before the scheme is corporatised. The inquiry will examine issues arising from the current pattern of water flows in the rivers and streams within and flowing from the Snowy mountains area, resulting from the operation of the scheme. The Commonwealth has agreed that New South Wales and Victoria are the two states which have principal responsibility for the Snowy scheme. Water management will jointly sponsor the public inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So if we set aside the concepts of commercialisation, of competition and competition policy and take on the issue of the environment, then it makes sense that you have to have an inquiry. That is the thrust, as I understand it, of page 8 of the second reading speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the question arises&mdash;and it has been referred to already by previous speakers: why does this bill come in now when the second reading speech says: `No, the effect of corporatisation should not become apparent until after an inquiry'? This legislation, if it is passed today, will come into operation more than six months down the track&mdash;which is not good, according to drafting instructions and according to such outstanding committees as the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. This legislation will come into operation at a time that is not in accordance with the general rules about legislation. It will come into operation after an inquiry, which inquiry will have, I would have thought, some significant impact on the very question of whether this scheme should be corporatised.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8393">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt one of the problems that faces the government is that this is an agreement between three governments: New South Wales, Victoria and the Commonwealth. They have sat down and had a look at this and they have come to an agreement. Part of the agreement is that each of those jurisdictions will bring into operation legislation. It is always difficult, no doubt, to arrange things so the actions of all the governments synchronise in the way that is wanted. Nevertheless, taking into account that issue, the problem remains: why take an action now that depends upon another action further down the line which may well impact upon the action of these three governments? So there seems to be a confusion of concepts in this legislation. The second reading speech goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry will be conducted by a single commissioner appointed by New South Wales and Victoria and will report within six months, followed by a two month period to agree a final outcome corporatisation to agree a final outcome. Corporatisation legislation will be finalised in all three parliaments following the states' agreements on the outcome.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So you have this paragraph in the second reading speech which guarantees that the legislation is going to come into operation more than six months down the line. Indeed, it might be a considerable time down the line because there has to be a report within six months followed by a two&hyphen;month period to agree a final outcome. How that is going to happen within two months, I do not know. Say the states do not agree. Say, in the light of the report by the single commissioner, Victoria does not agree or New South Wales does not agree or the Commonwealth does not agree. Then what will happen?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can anybody prior to an inquiry agree that there will be a final outcome? It seems to me to be a strange logic that you have an inquiry now; that the results of that inquiry are to be sent to three entities, the Commonwealth and two states; and then they have to finalise an outcome within two months. But suppose that they cannot; suppose that the discussion does not allow for that&mdash;unless there is already an agreement as to what will be the final outcome. If there is already an agreement as to what will be the final outcome, why do you need two months after the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> inquiry to get to it? This piece of legislation is a matter of concern. The speech continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Corporatisation legislation will be finalised in all three parliaments following the states' agreement on the outcome.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Does that mean that the Commonwealth does not have to agree? Does it mean the only agreement that is relevant is the agreement between New South Wales and Victoria? If the Commonwealth also has to be a party to the agreement, then why does the second reading speech say&mdash;and I read it again&mdash;`Corporatisation legislation will be finalised in all three parliaments following the states' agreement on the outcome.' What about the Commonwealth's agreement? Is the Commonwealth to have no say in this? The speech goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any outcome on environmental flows can only be determined in light of the finding of the water inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That sounds a very sensible and logical statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister's second reading speech is really saying that you can only determine a very central issue to this whole issue in the light of the finding of the water inquiry. Has there been an agreement? What is the extent of the agreement? What effect is the water inquiry to have on the outcome? Is it allowed to have any effect on the outcome? If so, that would seem to be inconsistent with some of the assurances given in the second reading speech as to when a finalisation of this matter is to be reached. The speech continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry will allow the views of all interested parties to be considered&mdash;irrigators, environmental interests and other downstream users of water. Until then, there is no valid basis on which governments can take any action to alter water allocations from the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Why bring in legislation prior to all these issues being determined? Is it being brought in now because the three governments cannot agree without there being some sort of legislation such as this put in place? If that is so, how does this legislation assure that that agreement will take place? Further in the second reading speech, the following statement is made:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8394">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments have been unfairly accused of taking no notice of calls for increased environmental flows for the Snowy River. To respond only to the views of one interested group in advance of a public water inquiry&mdash;particularly by legislating for environmental flows in the Snowy River&mdash;would clearly disenfranchise other legitimate interests in the inquiry from the decision making process. Governments have not been prepared to do this.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is good that they should not do that. It is good that, as this second reading speech says, everybody's interests should be taken into account&mdash;not only the environmentalists' interests but also the interests of farmers, of people who use the water generally. That seems to be a most sensible sort of a suggestion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But why have legislation introduced and why go ahead with this now when in the second reading speech the minister himself says, `Look, it would be a silly sort of a thing and a bit unfair to do anything before you have an inquiry.' That seems absolutely correct. But then, having said that in the second reading speech, the government goes ahead and does do something: it introduces this legislation and wants to pass it through. So it is a very confused message that comes out of this legislation, that comes out of the explanatory memorandum and that comes out of the second reading speech. The second reading speech continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also important that the potential financial impacts of any changed water arrangements impacting on Snowy Hydro Limited be identified before the corporatisation legislation is proclaimed. This will ensure that the company is established on a sound commercial basis and can operate in the competitive national electricity market.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That again makes a lot of sense. But then why take the steps that are taken in this legislation, without having all this worked out? If it had all been worked out, the minister could have come in here, in his lucid and intellectual way, and said, `Look, this is what we've done. We've had an inquiry. This is what we've found out. We've looked at the commercial projections. These are the sound commercial projections we are going to have with this corporatisation. We'll go ahead now and do it.' Then there would not be any need to put the proclamation of the legislation off to some unspecified time in the future.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Probably the best way of making the point is to ask: if this legislation is passed, when will it come into operation? I do not think anybody can tell us that. If they can tell us that, then much of the material in the second reading speech does not have the force that one would have thought it should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of passing legislation now and putting off its proclamation until some time down the line, why not go ahead and conduct the inquiries? Why not look at the economic ramifications, the environmental ramifications and the ramifications that it will have on the farmers? Then, with all that knowledge that will be before us, we can look at this legislation in a calm and measured fashion, as we always should in this chamber, and, as the minister would know, the measured debate which we always have in this chamber can be repeated in respect of this legislation. They are my thoughts from sitting here and listening to the debate. It seems that what has been said by previous speakers has a lot of force.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Margetts's excellent amendment because it builds on the commonsense of the argument that the heart of the Labor Party&mdash;if I might describe Senator Cooney and Senator Lundy in that  way&mdash;put to the committee. It is absurd to have a situation where the corporatisation, and therefore the loss of power, of the Commonwealth is being proposed in this bill when we do not have the results of a water inquiry into the sort of flow that is needed down the Snowy River to ensure its environmental viability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To reiterate, since the dam was built in Jindabyne, the flow down this remarkable river has dropped to less than one per cent of its previous natural flow. The result has been catastrophic. The description of everybody who goes to the river these days is that of languid pools, weed invasion, a shrivelled river, a haunting echo of the grandeur of the wild Snowy River of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Scientists have already established that more than a quarter of the natural flow&mdash;28 per cent&mdash;is the minimum required to ensure some ecological viability for the river in its flow through southern New South Wales and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8395"> Victoria to the ocean in the centuries ahead. Once corporatisation has occurred, that will not happen. The problem with the Labor Party's argument on this issue is that it does not flow through to a logical conclusion. We should take this opportunity to ensure that the outcome of the water inquiry is debated in this chamber before we go ahead and wipe our hands of responsibility. That is what we are doing if we pass this legislation for corporatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Labor Party is really serious about these concerns that the river be given viability, if it is genuinely going to do what it can and act on behalf of the river, its residents and all those who have come to love it, it will support Senator Margetts's amendment. What is the difference between Senator Margetts's amendment which says, `Let's withdraw this bill until we have the results of a scientific and community inquiry and then we can proceed,' and Labor's amendment which says, `Let's pass this bill in the Senate now, divest ourselves of power and leave it to Senator Parer to decide whether he is satisfied at the end of the inquiry to allow the corporatisation to go ahead'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difference is that of course Senator Parer will be satisfied. It will not matter what the outcome will be of the inquiry into the Snowy River's environmental health. As I said earlier, look at what Senator Parer did with the Jabiluka uranium mine proposal. Firstly, the traditional owners are opposed to that mine. Did he safeguard the key interests of that community? No, he did not. It was thumbs down to them; thumbs up to the uranium cartel. He gave the mine the go&hyphen;ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, there are extensive environmental reasons why that mine should not go ahead. For example, it will impact on the wilderness and the natural ecosystem, and there are insoluble problems that result from uranium mining, with uranium being dispersed around the planet. Does he have answers to those concerns? No, he does not. Has he held up the environmental concerns&mdash;</PARA>

If you really mean that you are going to act in the interests of the Snowy River and the residents downstream of the Snowy scheme, you support Senator Margetts's amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak to the amendment moved by Senator Margetts and to also indicate that the Democrats will be supporting this amendment. I am very disappointed that the Labor Party amendment is apparently&mdash;and from what we have heard, definitely&mdash;as far as they are prepared to go. In particular, I draw the attention of all senators to the speeches by Senator Cooney and Senator West, but in particular by Senator Lundy, who have outlined the concerns that Senator Brown, Senator Margetts and I have also been outlining. So how the Labor Party can now 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> apparently be prepared not to support the amendment I find amazing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what this amendment requires. It requires exactly what Senator Cooney was pointing out. Exactly the problem that Senator Cooney has identified will be solved if we support this amendment&mdash;if we look at the level of water flows before we move on and deal with the issue of corporatisation. I find it quite amazing, and interesting too, that the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) stands up, raises a point of order and says this bill is about corporatisation. Yes, of course it is, Minister, but almost all of us here are arguing that it should not be until we have dealt with the issue of what we are going to do with the water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the second reading speech of the minister says, and Senator Cooney has referred to this, all of this is set in place and the understanding of what needs to be done is well and truly on the table. But it is all being done in the wrong order. The order in which we should be dealing with this issue is, firstly, to decide where the water is going so that once it is corporatised we are confident that all community interests have been met&mdash;at least that they have been heard. But here we have a Commonwealth government hell bent on getting rid as fast as it can of any responsibility for basically the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin as well as the Snowy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the difficulties that giving more water&mdash;indeed, giving any water&mdash;over to the Snowy is going to create. That is why we need, I would suggest, a very thorough look at the upgrading of quite a number of irrigation schemes. If they are not upgraded they are finished anyway. Several of them are in their final throes. But the idea that irrigators seem to have that, yes, we will upgrade, but only if we can hang on to the water and then sell it off, is not in the best interests of any of our river systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if people such as Senator Lundy, Senator Cooney and Senator West, who have spoken very well about the key problems in western New South Wales and the key problems in the Snowy and the actual problems within the bill of the process, are really 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8397"> serious, hopefully they will talk the Labor Party around to understanding that we are not throwing out the concept of corporatisation. We are not even seriously discussing that here today. What we are saying is that we have to deal with the issue of where the water goes first. Surely, Minister, you understand that basic principle, that corporatisation should not go ahead until we know what is happening with the water out of the hydro&hyphen;electric scheme; indeed, the water out of all of that area in terms of whether it is even going to go east or west.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I ask the government but particularly the Labor Party to have another think about what we are doing here. I know the Labor Party is concerned not to be seen to be voting against corporatisation. We could have that debate later on down the track. If this amendment goes down and the second reading goes through at this stage, this government is abrogating its responsibility to the most important river system in this country. So I ask again that people seriously look at what the real issue is on the table before us today. Yes, of course it is the Snowy River. I have been there recently as well to look at the degradation. It is really a series of pools that are occasionally connected by a bit of a trickle. I commend a couple of the communities along the river in that some of the weeds have been cleaned up, but it is a losing battle unless we get some water back in the river. But this is not just about environmental flows to the east; it is also making sure we have sufficient environmental flows going west as well and looking at which rivers they are going to go into and how it is all going to be managed by way of timing. So I appeal to all senators to think again about what the real issue is before us here today.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since I last spoke in this debate, an amendment has been moved to the second reading by Senator Margetts of the Greens WA, and I would like to briefly address the amendment. The first thing I should do is rely on what I said at the beginning of my speech on the second reading. I said then that the corporatisation thrust in this legislation has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been agreed by those on this side when we were in government and we continue to support it now; and that at this stage I foreshadowed an opposition amendment to be moved in the committee stage of the bill. I will discuss that later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point in making both those observations at the commencement of my remarks on the second reading was to indicate that the opposition supports the thrust of this legislation and that were we in government it would be legislation that we would enact. Although that speaks to the principle of the legislation, the second part of my remarks was to mark the spot, that we did not regard the legislation as perfect in every detailed respect, and, at the same time as endorsing the principle, to indicate support for an amendment that I intended to move to bring the bill back to a level of detailed content that we could support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue that is behind the amendment moved by Senator Margetts I believe I understand well. Her amendment is quite clear. The effect of it would be that the bill does not have passage until such time as the findings of the water inquiry, as it has been referred to, with respect to the state of the river and the riverine systems affected by it have been brought to a conclusion and are able to be then proceeded with. So the obstacle that would be imposed by this amendment is that the bill would not proceed if this amendment were carried. That is not consistent with what I said at the beginning of my remarks&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the opposition believe though is that our amendment better addresses this issue. I know this matter has been the subject of debate, but I would like to go to the detail of our amendment. Our amendment is to clause 2 of the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Bill. It would omit subclause (3) of clause 2 and substitute a new subclause which would read:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Subclause (b) is irrelevant to this debate but enshrines back in the legislation what the provision essentially was before we deleted subclause 3.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the opposition's view there are two issues here. One issue is that of balancing Labor's very important concerns about the Snowy River and the surrounds of that river system. Those concerns have been canvassed by many members on my side&mdash;and I acknowledge their expositions and thank them for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also concerned about the electricity generating elements of the Snowy Mountains scheme and the need to press ahead with corporatisation in the context of rationalising electricity power generation in Australia: that is, in all parts of Australia except Western Australia. Therefore, we do not approach this from a one&hyphen;dimensional viewpoint. We approach it from the two&hyphen;dimensional viewpoint of what this scheme is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That does not mean to say that we place less weight on one or the other, but we do strongly state that both have to be considered. It is not a case of one to the exclusion of the other. In those circumstances we think that the amendment we have foreshadowed will address the problem that has been of  concern to the Senate this afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This does not delay the bill in the way the Greens' amendment would do. Therefore, we do not support the Greens' amendment. However, it does address both issues. For that reason, when the opportunity presents itself&mdash;if it does&mdash;we will move the amendment I have foreshadowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am on my feet, I must also say that I apprehend a further amendment that may be

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate on the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Bill and its associated consequential amendments. Following the introduction of these bills, the Treasurer, (Mr Costello), in his press release of 4 August announced changes to the way in which depreciations are to be calculated on assets of previously exempt entities that enter the tax net. As a result, any determination or regulation made under either Clause 51 or Clause 52 of the bill will be consistent with the policy announced by the Treasurer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts has moved a second reading amendment which calls for the bills to be withdrawn until a water inquiry is conducted and its recommendations are incorporated into the bills. As Senator Cook has quite correctly pointed out, that would kill this bill. The government will be opposing Senator Margetts's amendment. Senator Margetts obviously does not understand that corporatisation is not a threat to the environment. On the contrary, it is an opportunity to address any environmental problems that have been caused by the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme's existing arrangements prevent it from releasing water for environmental purposes, if that release reduces its capacity to generate electricity. That is the existing situation. In 1949, when the Snowy agreement was drafted, no&hyphen;one considered that there might be environmental problems associated with the scheme. Indeed, the whole great Snowy scheme was predicated on the diversion of the Snowy, predominantly, I might say, for irrigation purposes. The major engineering feat was incorporating the generation of electricity, in supporting that major aspect of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New South Wales, Victoria and the Commonwealth have worked closely together to set up a mechanism to address the environmental flow issue. It has been agreed that a six&hyphen;month water inquiry will be held before 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8399"> the scheme is corporatised. The legislation will not be proclaimed until after the inquiry has taken place and the states have considered its recommendations. If there are alterations to the water flow, they will be incorporated in the Snowy hydro's water licence. The licence will be reviewed regularly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were discussing the issue with New South Wales and Victoria&mdash;and this has gone on for a long time&mdash;there was extensive debate about whether the inquiry should take place before or after the scheme was corporatised. We have come out with the best result. We will be able to corporatise the scheme and implement the results of the inquiry process as soon as it is complete, rather than waiting for legislation to drag through three parliaments. I do not have to remind honourable senators of the long processes which can occur in getting legislation through three jurisdictions. That is quite an exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts wants to lock the results of the inquiry into legislation. It is a shame, Senator, that you did not attend the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee hearings of the bills, which you could have done. Senator Lundy and other senators on the committee did. You would have learnt that the Commonwealth does not have the constitutional power to grant water rights or to specify environmental flows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The corporatisation is an important initiative. As I mentioned earlier, it has been in the making for a long time&mdash;I think Senator Cook mentioned it goes back to 1990. It will enable the scheme to operate in the national electricity market; it will improve its corporate governance; it will facilitate the repayment of Commonwealth debt; and, at the same time, it will enable the process that we have outlined in the bill for a six&hyphen;month environmental impact flow inquiry, which will be broad and will cover all aspects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Someone mentioned Senator West's comments. I listened carefully to what Senator West had to say. One of her major concerns was the continuing flow for irrigation purposes to places like Griffith, and I think she talked about the great wine production that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> goes on down there. So it is not just the environmental aspects and not just the electricity considerations; it is also the water flows. It is the water that flows into the irrigation systems, and bear in mind that some of it flows eventually into South Australia. I commend the bills to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill gives effect to a number of measures announced in the Government's 1997&hyphen;98 Budget and to one non&hyphen;Budget item.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first of those measures is the introduction of a single parenting payment", to replace the current sole parent pension and parenting allowance. The new payment simplifies income support arrangements for parents by providing support for people with child rearing responsibilities, regardless of whether they are partnered or not. It also aims to reduce the social stigma which is sometimes associated with being a recipient of sole parent pension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parenting payment also aligns a number of conditions that currently vary between the existing payments. Administrative arrangements will be simplified, particularly where people move between lone parent and partnered status. Currently they need to cease receiving one payment and claim another. Core conditions, such as rates, income testing and concession cards will be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both parenting allowance and sole parent pension are paid for the same reason, except that parenting allowance is paid to partnered parents and the sole parent pension is paid to lone parents. A single parenting payment recognises a person's responsibility for caring for children irrespective of marital status.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the move toward simplicity and consistency, the bill also makes amendments to the social security allowance provisions aimed at simplifying the hardship rules that apply in relation to the ordinary waiting period, and the income maintenance period. Currently, the rules for waiver of various waiting periods in the legislation are inconsistent. They have different definitions of hardship and different types of expenditure can be taken into account. Amendments contained in the bill introduce a common approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The hardship rules will be standardised, with the first requirement being that the person is in "severe financial hardship". The test for determining whether a person is in severe financial hardship will be whether or not the person's readily available funds are less than the appropriate fortnightly rate of allowance. For the liquid assets waiting 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8401"> period and the income maintenance period, there will be an additional requirement that the expenditure that caused the severe financial hardship must have been "unavoidable and essential" (such as emergency medical treatment or mortgage/rent payments falling due in the waiting period.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides that the liquid assets waiting period may be partially waived, which is not possible under the current rules. This will align the liquid assets waiting period provisions with those applying to the income maintenance period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also contains amendments to simplify the Data&hyphen;matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990. In particular, the bill will remove references to specific payment and program types dealt with by the Social Security portfolio and replace these with a generic reference. This will remove the need to make legislative amendments each time a new payment is created or an old payment is renamed. Other amendments will also be made to the act to streamline the administration of the Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains amendments that introduce significant reforms in the area of child disability allowance. A simpler assessment process, involving a Child Disability Tool, will be introduced for use in relation to all new claims for disability allowance from 1 July 1998. The Assessment Tool will measure the impact of a child's disability on his/her functional ability in communication, mobility, self&hyphen;care and community living skills against developmental milestones. It will also assess a child's behaviour, emotional state and special care needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of the Assessment Tool will provide a simpler, more objective means of assessing eligibility for child disability allowance than the current criterion of "substantially more care an attention". It will provide a more objective method of assessment for parents and treating medical professionals, will minimise the subjectivity and inconsistency in the current criteria, will reduce the number of reviews and appeals, and will increase the level of understanding of the program by staff, parents and the medical profession. Parents with very disabled children have ben concerned that the child disability allowance payment has been seriously compromised over recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A list of manifest disabilities and a list of chronic medical conditions that will be attached to the Assessment Tool tables will provide fast tack entry to the program and less frequent medical reviews.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Existing recipients of child disability allowance are protected through the insertion of a 5 years savings provision. The amendments will also increase the number of days allowed in the temporary cessation of care provisions and a reduction in the maximum period for which child disability arrears are payable.  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes amendments that impact on Health Care Cards. The first change is a part of the major overhaul of the child disability allowance that has already ben mentioned. It is designed to assist those children whose parent or guardian does not qualify for child disability allowance (due to the amendments to the child disability allowance qualification criteria for a disabled child), by maintaining their eligibility for a Health Care Card. The second measure extends the period over which a person's income is assessed for the purpose of determining whether they are a low income, disadvantaged person who is eligible for a Health Care Card. The assessment period, presently 4 weeks, will be extended to 8 weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the bill changes the name of "family payment" to "family allowance". The change is made to help customers to understand more easily the social security system and their entitlements. Many families still use the term "family allowance", which was used to describe family payment entitlements from 1987 to the end of 1992.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sex Discrimination Act 1984 makes discrimination on the basis of marital status illegal. The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R238">Student and Youth Assistance (Sex Discrimination Amendment) Bill</XREF>  provides for a permanent exemption from that part of the Sex Discrimination Act for the Austudy and Abstudy student assistance schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, a person who is married, but not a person living in a de facto relationship, is entitled on that basis alone to the independent rate of Austudy, subject to the normal income and assessment tests and the actual means test, if applicable.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Abstudy living allowance, income testing and rent assistance eligibility criteria also come into conflict with the requirement of the Sex Discrimination Act in the same sort of way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Sex Discrimination Act contains an expiry provision which exempted student 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8402"> assistance schemes for a period of three years. This was to allow time for a way to be found to provide assistance to students without discriminating between those who are married and those in a de facto relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This point is very important because, unlike social security payments where the lower rates are often payable to people in married or de facto relationships, the incentive in Austudy is the other way. If de facto relationships, as well as marriage, were the sole criteria for receiving the independent rate, there would be a financial incentive for students under 25, where the independent rate is payable on the basis of age, to set up such relationships in order to be regarded as independent and free of parental means tests. This incentive is much stronger now following the government's unjustified and unreasonable decisions in its first budget to raise the independent age of Austudy payments from 22 to 25.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once the temporary legislative exemption for student assistance schemes in the Sex Discrimination Act had expired, the previous government sought exemption administratively through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Such exemptions are granted only for a finite period. When the Labor government's exemption period had expired the new coalition government sought a further exemption which will expire on 31 December this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In seeking this further exemption, the then minister, Senator Vanstone, undertook to provide a report to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission prior to the expiry of that exemption on long&hyphen;term solutions to address marital status discrimination in student assistance schemes. This report has only just been given to the opposition. We have only just received it, a very short time ago. I have not actually had an opportunity personally to view this report, but staff of the opposition received it a few minutes ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition finds it extraordinary that this bill which makes very clear the direction in which the government is heading on discrimination in Austudy and Abstudy was introduced before the commitment to report to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission had in fact been properly met. I say 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it ought to be properly met by our actually having the opportunity to study that report. Perhaps the government believes that the Commission would be too preoccupied with its own downgrading which has been forced on it to be concerned with student assistance matters. Perhaps the government just does not care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Either way, we in the opposition are appalled by such an approach. No&hyphen;one is going to deny that this is a difficult issue for any government to resolve. However, we cannot understand why a difficult issue must also be handled with such insensitivity. Student assistance matters have come in for a great deal of insensitive treatment from the Howard government, starting with the half billion attack on Austudy in its first budget, moving into Senator Vanstone's now infamous and incompetent administration of the revamped means test and culminating in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget's extraordinary attack on Abstudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recently completed review of the means test was initiated because of the anger amongst coalition backbenchers who had to go and face great numbers of angry meetings and deal with extraordinarily large numbers of constituent complaints. Constituents were frustrated and bewildered, complaining of up to 50 minutes in waiting time to get onto the so&hyphen;called hotline or having to wait for more than three months for a review. It is apparent that many have given up attempts to study because the minister's incompetence has restricted, beyond the point where they could carry on, their right to access income support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is not just a question of insensitivity in the way this matter has been dealt with. It is now, in the opposition's view, having a direct impact on the capacity of students to undertake study. The Commonwealth Ombudsman's report of 24 September said that Austudy needed a total overhaul. The report said the system was so complex that a PhD was needed to understand it and that it was failing students. At the centre of the complexity is the actual means test which has been changed by this government to make it almost unworkable.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8403">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1998 academic year will see yet another version of the means test. However, we hope that with the new ministerial arrangements the system will now be administered with a great deal more competence than has been demonstrated by this government in the past. In the 1997&hyphen;98 budget, the government turned its attention to Abstudy. It announced $38.7 million in cuts out of what was an annual expenditure of only $130 million. The government has described these cuts as better targeting but if this government was actually about better targeting then in the opposition's view these funds would surely not have been cut; they would have been redirected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Worse still, the government has announced a review of Abstudy after the cuts with a clear instruction that it should not recommend increased expenditure. These unjustified cuts demonstrate the government's lack of commitment to both indigenous education and to student income support. I know that the new Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, has indicated a preparedness to have another look at the Abstudy budget cuts and I hope this leads to a major rethink on the whole issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently the education committee of the Senate was in the Northern Territory speaking to Aboriginal groups about Aboriginal education and matters relating to the committee's work and it became abundantly clear that the government had not understood the full implications amongst Aboriginal communities of its changes to student assistance. It had not understood the impact on Aboriginal students in this country. During the second reading debate on the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill in November 1996 the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) spoke about the government's commitment to equal opportunity and the prevention of discrimination. Given the government's behaviour in relation to discrimination and student income assistance, however, and its pre&hyphen;emptory introduction of this bill it appears to have had no such commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill makes it perfectly clear that the government has decided that the issue of discrimination between married and defacto couples in relation to the student assistance 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> scheme is too hard. Of course, it is too difficult for this government to actually resolve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The opposition does not believe that this question should be dealt with in such a cavalier fashion. It is not good enough for the government to simply walk away from these important issues. We are not prepared to support a permanent exemption for Austudy and Abstudy from the marital status provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act. I will be moving an amendment which provides exemption for a three-year period only, during which time we would expect, and the community has a right, to see some sort of genuine effort being made by this government to address this difficult problem in a realistic, sensible and significant way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R238">Student and Youth Assistance (Sex Discrimination Amendment) Bill 1997</XREF>  seeks to grant a permanent exemption for Abstudy and Austudy from the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. I note that the exemption specifically applies to the treatment of students in defacto relationships and their definition as either independent or dependent. Currently student assistance schemes discriminate on the grounds of marital status in that the schemes differentiate between legally married and defacto couples.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats oppose the government's proposal for a permanent exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act. We believe that this is yet another deferral, another move, to avoid the task of finding a solution to this particular problem. We do not believe the proposal for a permanent exemption is acceptable and/or necessary. I take up Senator Carr's point relating to the report that was promised to this place and other senators. I acknowledge that it was faxed as soon as it was available, as I understand it, to my electorate office. So we have had an opportunity, albeit brief, to skim those pages. It is very important in the context of this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the most recent exemption that was granted to DEETYA by HREOC. I will quote from the correspondence that was addressed to the first assistant secretary of the youth, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8404"> students and social policy division on 29 November last year. In granting the exemption, HREOC gave a specific proviso. The precondition was the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator the Hon Amanda Vanstone, give an undertaking that a report will be made to the HREOC prior to the expiry of the proposed exemption&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is due to finish on 31 December this year&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on long term solutions to address the marital status discrimination within student assistance schemes (existing and proposed). This reporting would need to take into account the outcomes of the "Review of the Notions of Dependency" being conducted by the Minister for Social Security, Senator the Hon Jocelyn Newman.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clearly, this particular report is key to this entire debate because it was the basis on which the previous exemption was granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Democrats, like the opposition, will be moving an amendment. Originally we thought that a six-year exemption period would be appropriate. But I have decided that the most appropriate date would be 1 January 1999. That would be the maximum period of time that an exemption should be obtained or sought because it basically allows for the introduction and the operation of the common youth allowance legislation&mdash;something we will be debating in this place some time soon, I have no doubt. That is expected to start in July of next year. Assuming that something goes wrong, or it does not start on the date anticipated, I think 1 January 1999 is an appropriate time for which the exemption should be sought. I hope to see that amendment circulated shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the basis on which the Democrats would be prepared to grant an exemption. We think that it is time to have a short period. For that reason, we do not believe that Senator Carr's amendment is appropriate, simply because three years is too long. Governments&mdash;Labor governments and the current government&mdash;have avoided finding solutions to this problem for too long. If you have a period that is at the latest January 1999, it takes into account proposed changes to student and other assistance schemes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My understanding is that in that report and in the Commonwealth youth allowance legislation this anomaly, this discrimination, should be cleared up. If that is the case, I commend the government on actually solving that, but I look forward to the minister's remarks in response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 1976 to 1982 de facto couples were able to be defined as independent if they fulfilled certain criteria, including two statutory declarations, preferably from their parents. I note that that criteria was removed by the then Fraser government for new but not continuing students. That was back in 1981. In 1984, when the Sex Discrimination Act was enacted, section 40 of the SDA granted either a two-year exemption for prior legislation directly inconsistent with the act in order that those acts could be properly aligned with the SDA; or a permanent exemption for certain legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Student and Youth Assistance Amendment Act 1973 was not included on the permanent list. Instead, a two-year exemption was granted with a view to rectifying the discriminatory aspects of the act. In 1991 student assistance schemes were given a further three-year exemption. This exemption was granted despite the government's intention yet again to find a solution to eradicate the discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the minister, the Hon. Robert Brown, stated during the second reading speech of the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1991 in the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An exemption . . . is to be given to student assistance schemes provided for in the Student Assistance Act 1973. The criteria for means tests and rates of payment for these student assistance schemes are discriminatory on the basis of marital status. The Government has decided to undertake a review of the discriminatory provisions of these schemes over the next three years and has limited the period of exemption accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So after this expired Abstudy and Austudy became subject to a series of rolling exemptions through the system of administrative exemptions provided through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8405">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995, as some may recall, the ALP government proposed that a solution to address the discrimination was not to allow married couples to be granted independent Austudy. That proposal was rejected by the Senate and by the Australian Democrats. I mentioned earlier the most recent exemption to be granted&mdash;that is, in November last year&mdash;by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the proviso on which that exemption was based, and that was that a review was being conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is obvious certainly to the Australian Democrats and I hope others in this chamber that yet another exemption is not an acceptable solution to address marital discrimination in student assistance schemes. At no point over the past 13 years was it proposed that student assistance schemes be permanently exempted from the SDA, although there were such opportunities, I believe, in 1984 and 1991. However, the coalition government has decided to pursue this option&mdash;that is, of seeking a permanent exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the bill before us has passed through the House of Representatives without any member of parliament citing the particular report. We may be complaining, Senator Carr and Senator Margetts, that we have not seen a copy of this report but what about those members of the lower house who had to debate and make a decision on this bill with no knowledge of that report? It certainly does highlight the scrutiny and the nature of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But when this was raised in the House the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Mr Abbott, did brush aside this concern&mdash;that is, that no report had been cited or read&mdash;and he claimed that the government was preparing the report and it would be entirely consistent with the legislation that is before us today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can this be possible when the government has not been consistent in its own treatment of de facto couples? De facto status will enable a young person to establish independence for the purposes of the proposed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> common youth allowance, yet students will not be able to similarly establish their independence in this manner. So it seems a bit unusual and somewhat unfair to treat students in a different manner from that of young people generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be highly unlikely that the provisions made under the common youth allowance legislation to avoid `rorting the system' could not be readily applied to student assistance schemes as appropriate data matching and fraud checks are already in place.</PARA>
