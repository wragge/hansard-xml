<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating in the committee stages schedule 4 of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , which covers nearly eight per cent of Australia and lists those leases which have been advised as conferring exclusive possession and, therefore, where native title is unable to be claimed. The schedule includes all sorts of things&mdash;from Scouts halls to grazing homesteads and perpetual leases, but there are no pastoral leases in this schedule. There are some 15,000&mdash;nearly 80 per cent of the leases in Queensland&mdash;freehold perpetual leases that have been granted for ever and a day. If this schedule goes down, they will be subject to native title and all that implies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Premier of Queensland has worked very hard and assiduously to get these leases on. They are not, I repeat, a grazing lease; they are a perpetual lease. I would say that 80 per cent of Queensland graziers have this type of lease, some have dual ownership of this type of grazing lease. But most of the smaller holdings&mdash;the 20,000; 30,000; 40,000 acres&mdash;are these types of perpetual leases; the big properties are the grazing leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So if you draw a line from Dalby and out to Roma, most of the sheep country is covered by this type of lease. If this parliament were to let these people down&mdash;those who have been lulled into a false sense of security by the fact that the Premier of Queensland and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have told them that their leases are safe&mdash;if today they find that they are pushed out of their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> safety zone, then you are going to hear a big cry from the bush.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) talked very smoothly about certainty and how native title is mostly about fishing and camping. Under these amendments, they will expose farmers to the greatest uncertainties by refusing to confirm that their leases reflect exclusive possession. We keep coming back to the underlying uncertainty: what is native title itself? It is very misleading of the Leader of the Opposition to say that native title is mostly about fishing and visiting small parts of a property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most claims I have seen have been for millions of acres, and many prominent native title crusaders have said that native title is a lot more than just going onto a property and fishing or getting a piece of wood for a didgeridoo. We have heard it is from housing to economic development. Some Aboriginal people have said that native title&mdash;and I think Senator Harradine agrees with this, which surprises me&mdash;is a better form of title than a lease.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine corrects me and says that it is a different title and more underlying. Nevertheless, this uncertainty created by continually hearing that it is not just a visit to the property or going and getting a piece of wood for a didgeridoo. It is not just traditional pursuits. If that were the case, there would never be any opposition to people going on and moving around the properties. There never has been, and I do not think there ever would be. Even now, during this uncertainly of the times, I hear that Aboriginal people are still going onto the properties in Cape York.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very important schedule because it covers most of the pastoral activity in Australia. I certainly hope we can rely on Senator Harradine's support to defeat this amendment relating to this schedule and back up what Kim Beazley said&mdash;that he would give certainty and that Aboriginal native title was really only about going on small parts of properties. If it were only that, as I said, there would be no problems with native title. But 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10503"> until we know what native title is, until we know that these schedules are excluded from claim, there will continue to be a huge amount of uncertainty out there. I would support the continuation of schedule 4 in the legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to say anything until Senator Boswell made some comments. I must say to my friend Senator Boswell that what he has been saying has unnecessarily and unforgivably caused grave concern amongst ordinary people, farmers, in the bush, particularly in Queensland. If he does not know what native title is, he has not read the Mabo judgment or the Wik judgment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a matter that, as I said, we in the parliament over the years should have been dealing with in statute law. Had we done that we would have been able to have certainty and the farmers of Australia, the miners of Australia, the people of Australia, including the indigenous people of Australia, would have had certainty. But we failed in that responsibility, and that responsibility was taken up by the courts as a result of an application by persons who knew that they had an underlying right to native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court made the decisions. At the time, in 1993, I did say that the High Court had put us to shame for not doing what we as parliamentarians should have been doing over the years. I do not include in that everybody here. Those of us who were here are to blame. We then had to face the High Court's determination that terra nullius was a legal fiction. Arising from that, there was an underlying right to native title. Following Wik, at that time people did feel that pastoral leases extinguished native title. That was knocked into a cocked hat by the Wik decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what are we about? It seems to me that some people are going around the place saying parliament is doing and imposing this, that and the other on pastoral leaseholders. We are not. We are trying to codify with some certainty&mdash;as much certainty as we possibly can&mdash;in this legislation what we believe and what appears to be the common law rights, in any event, of native title holders 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and of everybody else. We are trying to do it with some degree of justice and balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My staff get calls from worried pastoralists and their wives, crying over the phone and that sort of thing. That is totally unnecessary and I believe unforgivable. Those people have been unnecessarily upset because, when this legislation goes through, pastoralists will be able to do the same thing that they were able to do before. You have not read it if you think otherwise. They will be able to do the same things without having to negotiate as they are able to do now. If they want an upgrade, depending on how big the upgrade is, that could trigger the right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Senator Boswell, through you, Madam Chairman: bear in mind that I come from the bush. I was raised in the bush and I was educated in my primary school in the bush. I know what it is like. I know what it is like to be on a farm where the mother is there with seven kids on her own. I know what persons may be feeling and the fear that is in the hearts of some of those women who are out on their own whilst their husbands are working elsewhere to make some money because the farm will not provide the necessary income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel that to describe this legislation now as fit for the ash can is also absolutely unnecessary. What we have here is the Howard government bill&mdash;90 per cent. Let nobody forget that. I am prepared to take the flak for this. I took the decision rightly or wrongly some two weeks ago that I would adopt a minimalist position. The government is here to govern. It is trying to do a job. It is trying to codify as best it can what the High Court has said, and I was prepared to help that situation. My amendments, I hope, will improve it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cutting edge issue, I suppose, is the mining on pastoral leases, if you want to boil it down to that. As I said last night, that is a matter where I believe it is just not appropriate for indigenous native title holders to be able to have the right to negotiate when it comes to mining on crown land and not have the same right to negotiate when it comes to mining on their land, their rights coexisting 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10504"> with pastoral leaseholders. That is it in a nutshell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us always remember, and I appeal to you to always understand this, that what Wik said really was that there could be coexistence of rights over a particular land&mdash;coexistence of native title rights with the rights of the leaseholders&mdash;but that the rights of the leaseholders and their interests prevail over the rights and interests of native title holders if the exercise of those rights interferes with pastoralists. That is it in a nutshell. The people I know out bush have coexisted with the Aboriginal people for years and years. They should not be concerned unnecessarily about this particular legislation. I was going to vote for the government on this schedule before you rose from your seat, Senator Bolkus, and I still am.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is very difficult because we had a member of the National Party yesterday saying that she would approve of pastoralists being armed with illegal weapons. I find this totally over the top.

It just gets to me that we constantly allow people to run around in the media and to raise the temperature in this debate, as members of the National Party have done.

Not only do we get a lecture, but we do not get from him any apology for those statements by De-Anne Kelly&mdash;no apology whatsoever.</PARA>

We have debated a number of times the fact that, currently, a native title claim over freehold land does not mean a thing.

It is not the requirement of those with freehold; you do not have to defend it, as some people have suggested. It does not actually prove anything.

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are numerous examples of native title claims which have been accepted by the National Native Title Tribunal (NNTT) over freehold and exclusive possession leasehold tenure in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of these claims specifically include freehold granted after 1 January 1994 despite the fact that these grants were made as a result of land subdivisions subject to pre-existing larger freehold titles. There are several thousand titles of this type issued in WA each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All freehold in the South-West is subject of claims which means that, every time a subdivision occurs and a new freehold title is issued, that freehold is automatically under claim and the owners are parties to the claims process. All these claims will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> eventually have to be referred to the Federal Court as they will be unable to be resolved by mediation. This means that the freehold owners will be forced to defend their interests in court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Invariably claims include freehold held by the state, government agencies and government trading enterprises. They also include freehold titles granted after 1 January 1994 even though these titles are created on land which had been previously private freehold and had been subdivided, or Crown freehold set aside as freehold land for many years, in some cases more than fifty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are over 40,000 such titles in the Perth metropolitan region alone. Every time one of these blocks of land is sold to a private party, it remains claimed and the private owner again becomes automatically a party to the native title claim process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One example of this problem is the recent sale of homes in the North West town of Exmouth. The land involved was acquired by the Western Australian Government from pastoral leases in 1963 in an agreement between the State Government, the Commonwealth Government and the Government of the United States of America for the purposes of constructing the Exmouth tracking station and the town of Exmouth to house and provide services for US servicemen and other residents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The land was subdivided in the 1960s for housing and servicing (road, amenities, community facilities).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the agreement for returning land to the State in 1992, each lot was to be offered for public sale. Land was returned to the Western Australian Government, including freehold land held by the Commonwealth, and passed back into the Crown estate before being offered for sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">94 Homes have been sold and new titles have been issued to the purchasers. These titles are now subject to a native title claim which has been accepted by the NNTT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another example of freehold being claimed in the South West region of Western Australia is where the holders of conditional purchase lease or a war service lease exercise their obligation to convert the lease to freehold. Since 1994 over 200 leases have been converted and the owners have been issued with freehold titles. All of these freehold titles are subject to accepted native title claims despite the State Government providing the NNTT with the details of the conversions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Title holders have been receiving notices form the NNTT to attend mediation conferences. Some farmers have had to interrupt their harvesting activities to attend these conferences in the last 3 weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are also 33 freehold titles subject to multiple claims in the Bremer Bay Townsite in Western 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10506"> Australia. In this case the land had previously been subject to conditional purchase leases which the Crown acquired and developed as a residential subdivision. The land was sold in October 1995. The purchasers have all been advised by the NNTT that their titles are under claim and they are to attend mediation conferences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was done despite numerous submissions from the State Government seeking to have these titles excluded from the claim. Mediation has not been successful and now the title holders will be required to defend their title in the Federal Court. Some have deferred plans to build homes on the land because of the claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to being subdivided and developed, this land was the subject of a conditional purchase lease which carries a legal right of conversion to freehold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to claims over freehold there are also claims over residential lease hold in various parts of the state. These are residential leases which have been granted with exclusive possession. One such example is the 99 year residential leasehold in Kalgoorlie which is under claim.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will attempt to be brief. Obviously there are legal disputes over property transfers, contracts and other things as part of our general law all the time&mdash;landlords trying to get rid of tenants and tenants complaining about landlords and whether a title has been effectively transferred and all those sorts of things. But we are dealing here with a completely different situation. This is the interaction of a statutory title issued by the Crown purporting to grant exclusive possession to the titleholder being challenged by a person exercising what they believe to be their common law property rights in relation to that exclusive statutory tenure and all the consequences that flow from that. That is the whole point about native title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why it is obviously difficult for most Australians to comprehend. Generally we do not have a concept any more of common law property rights as such, exercisable in the way that native title is. Our land title system is statutory. The interrelationship of that common law title, which is not defined and has to be determined on a case&hyphen;by-case basis based on the traditional law and custom of the people who make the claim, and the statutory title that has been granted over the land is the essence of the issue. If you have claims, as is happening at least in relation to public freehold, what is the relationship between the statutory title which purports to grant exclusive possession to the title holder when a common law claim is made seeking to exercise native title rights on that property?

It is when the crown exercises that sovereignty in such a way as to grant exclusive possession by virtue of its acquisition of the sovereignty that has the extinguishing effect. As Brennan makes clear, there is no reversion to the native title; there is a reversion to the crown because of the crown's acquisition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might address the issue of how schedule 4 was put together because it is obviously of some concern to the other parties. It is, as I think we have stated before, a schedule containing leases which the Commonwealth government considers on the basis of the common law of conferred exclusive possession on the lessee 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and, therefore, as a result of Mabo and Wik, have extinguished native title.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have rejected a number of the proposed state and territory leases which we were not satisfied were grants of exclusive possession. If there was any doubt, it was not put on the list. It contains basically specific types of residential, commercial, community purpose and agricultural leases. There are no pastoral leases in the schedule nor are there lesser interests, such as licences or permits, and mining leases are specifically excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did take the draft schedule, equally and at the same time, to indigenous and farming representatives, who were briefed on it and were invited to examine and discuss it with us before any final determination of it was made. We have gone through what I believe to be a quite exhaustive process in ensuring that this schedule is independently assessed on a legal basis and that we have adopted an extremely conservative approach. It covers only leases in those particular categories and those leases cover 7.7 per cent of Australia. It leaves open for native title claims 79 per cent of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe it is important that the parliament confirm the fact that exclusive possession has been granted in relation to these leases and, therefore, native title is extinguished. If you do not say that and you say that native title may have survived on these leases and that they are all the same, then all of those 60,000 lessees who have grants of exclusive possession are open to native title claim and potentially every one of them is subject to a determination in court as to whether or not exclusive possession has been granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legal advice we have, as I said&mdash;independently assessed by a separate professor of law at the University of Sydney&mdash;is that they grant exclusive possession, therefore, the prospects of native title surviving are, in our view, zero. But if you leave them open to be tested, you leave open to the courts potentially 60,000 case-by-case determinations as to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10508"> whether or not a grant of exclusive possession has been granted, when that is clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To us it seems much better to have the energy, resources and time of this nation devoted to determining the existence of native title on the 79 per cent of Australia on which we know it may have survived&mdash;that is, all pastoral leases, vacant crown land and Aboriginal land. So the resources of all of us involved in this process are devoted to seeking those determinations. As a government we are devoting the resources to seeking those determinations. We have absolutely no difficulty with those determinations being made and we hope they will be made. We applaud the Hope Vale agreement which will result in the first determined native title being exercised on the mainland of Australia. But we do believe that, in the interests of certainty, these exclusive possession leases ought to have their exclusive possession confirmed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is worth putting on the record that probably one of the most unrecognised aspects of the Wik debate is the fact that the Wik people have not as yet had their rights to coexist on the land confirmed. The Wik case confirmed that a pastoral lease did not necessarily extinguish native title, but it went on to say that, for the purposes of the particular claim in question, the Wik people had to pursue their claim on the basis of the individual leases involved in their situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to put that on the record in the context of this debate because 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the government is going down a road which is fundamentally flawed. It is not looking at the individual leases, which is what the Wik decision demanded should happen in the case of the Wik people. It is not doing that. It is going to categories of leases, it is going to instruments at state law and it has asked all the state governments, as I said last night, to produce their shopping lists of what provisions, what categories of leases and so on should be covered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within that collection of shopping lists we have already found some leases that you could say did not necessarily extinguish native title. We also found historic leases, ghost leases, leases that had expired. We are also in no real position to make an assessment as to whether all those categories actually do confer exclusive possession. To the extent that there is any vagueness, we do not know that the actual leases pursuant to those categories confer exclusive possession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are doing here precisely what the High Court in Wik refused to do. That was to make a general assessment of people's rights on the basis of a categorisation of a lease. They will probably have to go through processes for another five to 10 years. What this particular legislation will do is cut away their rights to pursue claims under the causes of action they have instituted already. One of the cruel things about this particular measure is that the Wik people, having won that case last year, will probably have their rights rendered ineffectual because of the provisions, particularly in this part of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us get it on the record that the government is being a bit fast and loose with this. If they say, `It takes so many resources to get it right. We think we have some certainty with what we are putting up,' and they cannot get it right with the resources of a Commonwealth government and all the state and territory governments to go through the instruments, how do you think the claimants, the rep bodies and their representatives will be able to do it within the timetables and processes laid down by this legislation?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear from the majority judgments in Mabo that native title is extinguished by an unqualified grant of an inconsistent estate in land by the Crown or other inconsistent dealings with land by the Crown as stated by Brennan, Deane, Gaudron and Toohey.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will have seen from what I said of Brennan yesterday the enormous legal complexity of any notion of revival. We have stated in our amendments&mdash;which we have yet to formally adopt&mdash;that, where a past extinguishing act has occurred on land occupied by Aboriginal people, either by a dedicated reserve or land which has reverted to vacant crown land which they occupy, then any previous extinguishing act, either partial or full, is to be disregarded for the purposes of the native title claim.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Commonwealth legislation should, where practical, maintain common law rights and the possibility of the ongoing recognition rather than peremptory extinguishment. What I am doing in my amendments is being consistent with the Wik decision, maintaining the possibility that native title may be merely suspended rather than extinguished forever to the extent of the inconsistency, that is, the pastoral leaseholders' rights prevail over the native title holders' rights to the extent of whatever the inconsistency of the latter is with the former.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is every possibility, I believe, that native title was only suspended for the duration of the lease. Legislative action taken to extinguish rather than to suspend potentially surviving rights falls short, I believe, of the fair and decent balance which all parties, including the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), are seeking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had another think about this. I put it to you that the word `suspended' instead of `extinguished' could be put in proposed section 23G to make that clear. You may well have a point with 237A but, whilst you have 237A, that is going to be read down to apply. The word `extinguish' in 23G is going to be read in conjunction with 237A, and I do not think that is appropriate at all.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to briefly respond to that. Brennan was in the minority on the question of whether a native title was necessarily extinguished by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the grant of a pastoral lease. That was the case. The case did not turn on the issue of the effect of extinguishment. The question was whether the grant of the lease necessarily extinguished native title. Mabo had said that leaseholds, the grant of a lease, necessarily extinguishes native title. In Wik, 4:3, they decided the grant of a pastoral lease does not necessarily do so&mdash;it may, but you have to examine the terms of every lease to work out whether the rights granted under that particular lease extinguish the native title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the High Court has not decided that native title can revive. Brennan, in his minority judgment saying that pastoral leases do necessarily extinguish native title, went on to state the law as we understood it to be arising out of Mabo&mdash;that is, once extinguished, always extinguished. That was the point. They used the word `extinguish' through Mabo and Wik, all of them, quite deliberately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Toohey was talking about was that, where the native title rights are not extinguished but can survive, they survive subject to the rights of the pastoralist. In other words, their exercise, even though they are not necessarily inconsistent, may survive and may, therefore, be treated as being suspended, I suppose, while the consistent rights are being exercised. Toohey says in his judgment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is that inconsistency&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, where rights that are granted are inconsistent&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that renders the native title rights unenforceable at law and in that sense extinguished.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He was then basically saying that, if the two can coexist, no question of implicit extinguishment arises and it is implicit extinguishment with which these peoples are concerned. So he is saying that you have to draw the distinction between rights granted that are inconsistent with native title. Where that is the case, as Toohey says `extinguishment', where they are not inconsistent but can both survive, it is what he describes as suspension. While the consistent rights are being exercised, you have to have in law some sort of relationship and, as the majority said, where consistent rights are being exercised, the statutory rights of the pastoralist prevail over

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">23G leaves entirely to the courts the question of which native title rights and interests are inconsistent with the rights granted under the lease. That is a matter for the courts entirely. All we are talking about is what happens once the court finds an inconsistency,

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, I have one point that I would like to add in respect of the government's amendments. It has not been raised before, but it relates to amendment No. 5. Arising from what I say, I would like to defer consideration of amendment No. 5 until later on in the voting process. What amendment No. 5 seeks to do is to delete (4) and (5) of 23B. It does so to redress that the, as we are told, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10516"> unintended consequence of the government's amendments which would ensure that native title could be extinguished on national parks and conservation reserves. The government is seeking to redress that situation to ensure that 23B does not have that effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are concerned about is that, even if you were to remove 23B(4) and (5), you would still have 23B(3) there. We are asking the government to consider removing (3) as well. Our concern is that the only real effect that (3) may have is that native title may be extinguished over land or waters vested in bodies which expressly or impliedly have a right to exclusive possession conferred. The only direct effect of that would be to extend what is taken to amount to exclusive possession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You may have a situation, for instance, where land is reserved for government purposes, for defence purposes. A licence or a permit is given in respect of occupation. If a right to exclusive possession can be inferred from all the circumstances of that licence, permit or other interest, then subsection (3) will affect extinguishment. We are concerned that subsection (3) is so vaguely worded that, in order to achieve your stated objective of allowing claims in respect of national parks and conservation reserves, you may have to delete that as well and maybe amend it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I flag that at this particular stage. I think the government's advisers should take a few moments to consider the point we raise. In any event, we would like the government to consider moving amendment No. 5 to delete not just 23B(4) and (5) but also (3).

Sometimes these things, because they were not forecasting native title, do not expressly say that it is a grant of exclusive possession. You have to construct that. Of course, that is what the courts do. So we do think you have to leave the word `impliedly', otherwise it could be inoperative. It still remains the case that it can be judicially heard.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment on sheet 841 is actually one of the `In Case of Fire: Break Glass' amendments. It is an amendment regarding the non&hyphen;extinguishment arising from previous exclusive possession acts on native title on freehold land. I think it goes to the nub of what this debate has been going through over a couple of hours last night and today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's proposed confirmation of extinguishment provisions will extinguish native title wherever there has been a grant of a previous exclusive possession act in the past. This will include grants from the Crown to itself or to a Crown owned statutory authority. Proposed section 23B of the bill confirms that the grant of various estates, including of freehold, to any private person should extinguish native title. While the grant of a freehold estate to a private person extinguishes native title in accordance with various decisions of the High Court, it is unjust and contrary to the common law that extinguishment should apply to all crown to crown grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Mabo No. 2, Justice Brennan expressly&mdash;this is interesting because Senator Minchin has often quoted Justice Brennan in the last day or so&mdash;left open the question of whether the creation of certain crown interests in land such as a national park extinguish native title. In view of the principles adopted by the court in Wik, it is likely that crown grants to itself or a corporation wholly owned by it will not necessarily extinguish native title. The government's confirmation of extinguishment forecloses this question against indigenous interests without any definitive ruling in support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some states and territories, most particularly the Northern Territory, grants of freehold 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to a statutory corporation owned by the Crown have been used as a specific device to prevent claims under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. The government's amendment would compound that injustice. There is no principle whereby a national park, for instance, created by a freehold grant to the parks service should extinguish native title where a permanent dedication of that land does not. The proposed amendment does not prevent interest granted to third parties within those areas from extinguishing native title if there are previous exclusive possession acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed section 23B(9) of the bill exempts Aboriginal owned land from the extinguishing effect of the confirmation provisions. Similarly, section 23(2) of the Native Title Act, which the government has not amended, exempts validated freehold crown to crown grants which were past acts from any extinguishing effects. Aboriginal land is also exempted. This principle should apply to all such acts. What we have asked is this:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Margetts in this. As with all parts of this bill, this is another of those very important issues. All advice available indicates that the government's proposed section 23B(3) constitutes an unacceptable risk. The majority in Mabo and Kirby J in Wik stated that the issue of whether a statute extinguishes by necessary implication depends upon the language, character and purpose which the statute was designed to advise; that is at page 283. Nevertheless, the government is proposing to confirm extinguishment where there has been an existing, expressly or implied, exclusive possession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no requirement to analyse the legislation in order to determine whether the statute intends to extinguish native title. For example, state or territory legislation which vests land in local authorities could be said to imply a right to exclusive possession. Certainly local authorities may be empowered to make grants over some or all of the land within their control of exclusive possession or lesser interests, such as one listed in proposed section 23B(2). However, such legislation could not be said to be designed to extinguish native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As stated in the recent native title report of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner released in August this year, the bill's focus on the issue of exclusive possession does not accurately reflect the common law, particularly for statutory titles. The questions put to the High Court in Wik linked exclusive possession to necessary extinguishment. In Justice Gummow's view, the proposing of a question in those terms may have distorted the essen 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tial issues. Earlier in his judgment he had explained that attention is to be focused on the terms of the legislation and to the instruments themselves. In that examination, the term `exclusive possession' is of limited utility.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is to give the widest coverage for land granted to Aboriginal peoples, in view of the obvious desire to ensure that they can claim native title. But with other crown to crown grants it is, in the government's view, a much more difficult area, because you are talking about thousands of housing trust homes which are on crown to crown grants if it is a housing trust authority or something like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The embrace of land held by that Crown in the right of the Crown by any statutory authority, or something like that, includes a whole host of properties of that kind&mdash;thousands and thousands of housing trust houses. If you do not do this, it means that claims can be accepted and ultimately have to be tested. Obviously, where there is exclusive possession, the claim will not succeed, but 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10523"> you again put everybody into litigation for no purpose at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That will mean that, instead of resources going to where native title may have survived, housing trust housing will potentially be subject to claims. We think that is a serious matter. Where there is a grant of freehold, it does not matter who actually holds the title. To try to devise a system of law that depends not upon the rights granted but to whom they are granted, with the exception of Aboriginal people, is to invite considerable legal uncertainty&mdash;something which this whole act is designed to remove.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment has been agreed upon and is on page 832 as circulated. This is an important amendment for all of us in this place who have an interest in observing the principles of non&hyphen;discrimination. At the end of the day 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10527"> when one visits this debate over the last 40 hours that we have been in committee, people will find that quite often concerns have been expressed as to whether the government's legislation is in conformity with the principles of non-discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For us it is important that at the end of the day this Senate be judged on the basis that, with all those concerns and doubts and with all the advice coming to us, we were prepared to take a position that said in the interpretation of the legislation the principles of non-discrimination should be applied. The best way to apply the benchmark of non-discrimination is to apply both the domestic and internationally accepted benchmark, the Racial Discrimination Act as it applies in the International Covenant on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Principally, the effect of what we are doing is to use sections 9 and 10 of the RDA. Section 9 deems racial discrimination to be unlawful and section 10 deems that one has a right to equality before the law. The effect of these provisions would be not to render any law invalid, but to offer and confer on persons who have been discriminated against on the grounds of race, colour or national or ethnic origin the same rights as are enjoyed by persons of another race, colour or national or ethnic origin on whom there are conferred superior rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a provision which ensures that the principle of non-discrimination applies. It is not merely a provision which invalidates other laws. It is an act of the Australian Parliament which confers the concept of equality and confers specific rights on individual Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, there have been concerns throughout the debate on this bill as to the discriminatory nature of so many provisions. Whether it is the confirmation of past extinguishment, the upgrading of rights, the validation of crown granted titles at the expense of native title, the winding back of the freehold test, the absence of a special measure which is necessary&mdash;all these matters are of important concern to members in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not just of concern to people in this place. We are not alone in our concerns. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We know, for instance, that the Chief General Counsel of the Commonwealth has expressed concerns as to the potential for discriminatory impact of at least three of the government's important provisions in its legislation. We have had reams of evidence from a whole range of organisations expressing concern as to the discriminatory aspects of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to go through them all. In the past I have published a list of organisations that have expressed concerns as to the discriminatory nature of this legislation. I have shown that list to Senator Minchin. It will include Aboriginal views, a range of church views and views from archbishops and social justice commissioners and so on. There are legal views from Alex Shand QC, the Australian Law Reform Commission, the Human Rights Commissioner, former members of Liberal governments and the Race Discrimination Commissioner. There are independent views and there are also a range of views from people associated with the conservative Liberal side of politics, including Ian Viner, Neville Bonner, Alex Shand, Ian MacPhee and Fred Chaney. There are also Labor views. It is important that the record show those views and I will seek leave at the end of my contribution to have those views incorporated on the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of this provision is to make it clear that we have taken into account the views expressed by such a strong body of opinion. We have also taken into account the fact that the government has not seen fit to provide the views of the Chief General Counsel and has not been prepared to make those views public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The joint parliamentary committee on native title and the Senate legal and constitutional committee inquiring into the Native Title Amendment Bill  had views expressed to them from a whole range of eminent people expressing concerns as to the discriminatory nature of the legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment before us concerning the Racial Discrimination Act goes to the very core of the deliberations in this place and what sort of country it is that we want to live in. I doubt if anyone here would assert that they are openly racist, but I further doubt whether most people in this place really understand what racism is or are able to look in their own hearts and understand prejudice, for in some ways all of us are prejudiced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A cursory look at the Racial Discrimination Act will give us some neat, legal definitions, but what it will not do is show us what discrimination is like when you are at the receiving end. Despite my extensive experience of working with Aboriginal people, I have not had their experiences, I have not walked in their shoes, I do not know what it is like to be treated as a foreigner in my own country. If any senator does not know that this is the almost daily experience of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country, then I wonder if they have met an a indigenous person or have taken time to listen to their life experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If anyone in this chamber wanted to think that this racial discrimination legislation does 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10530"> not affect indigenous people, they merely had to look up into the public gallery over the last few days to see the faces of Aboriginal and Islander Australians watching this debate. Their faces were streaked with tears, their eyes were often sad&mdash;sometimes angry&mdash;and, apart from a solitary cry of `Shame', they were silent. They were the faces of people who are being racially discriminated against.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already spoken about the story of Johnny Koowata, which is a quite famous one because it went as far as the High Court. I have mentioned that even though he won his case in the High Court the Queensland government took action to make sure that he never obtained justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could speak of some of my other experiences&mdash;or rather, not my experience but what I was able see of others' experiences by walking alongside them. I am going to put some of them on the record. These are daily occurrences. When I worked in the Uniting Church as the Director for Social Responsibility in Queensland I had responsibility for a number of Aboriginal churches in Brisbane and other places. We had a pastor named Keith Warner, an Aboriginal man. We were wanting to shift him into an area, so we had to get him some accommodation. I looked up the various places for rent, phoned up and said, `We have a pastor of our church, Keith Warner. He is looking to rent a place.' They said,`That's good. That'll be great. Send him along and we will see what we can do.' I said to Keith, `It's all fixed up. Away you go.' Off he went. As soon as he walked in, he said he could see the reaction on their faces. Would you believe that all of sudden that place had already been let? So he came back and told me what had happened. I let about an hour go past and then I phoned again, to discover that miraculously that rental place was still on the market. This is not an isolated occurrence. This happens all the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I finally got rental for Pastor Keith Warner, now the Reverend Keith Warner. When he had finished there after two years and he was to shift to another place, he asked for his bond back. He was refused, and they told him the place was dirty. I went to have a look. It was spotless. It had been cleaned from top to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bottom. I said to Keith, `Go back and ask for it.' He said, `Oh no, we never get our bonds back.' And he just would not pursue the matter. This happens every day to Aboriginal people in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even people who are well intentioned&mdash;I know I have done it myself&mdash;often do not understand their actions. My wife took a number of women who were very much committed to the work that we were doing amongst the Aboriginal people to one of our Aboriginal churches in Brisbane to have lunch with them. A number of the women from the white church took their own lunch and did not understand what it was that they were doing or understand the effect that had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even language is something. Until we can begin to see something through the eyes of Aboriginal people we do not understand what we are doing. For instance, in Sunday school we grew up with the expression `Sin is black'. Have you any idea what that kind of language means to an Aboriginal person? But it never occurred to me until one day an Aboriginal person finally pointed that out to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Deep down, I suspect that the hysteria around freehold land, despite the assertions otherwise, lie deep in the psyche of this nation. It is an institutionalised fear in this country. Some people really are scared. The National Farmers Federation, most notably Dr Wendy Craik and Mr Donald McGauchie, have done nothing to alleviate the situation. They have poured time and money into turning up the heat with campaigns of misinformation and scaremongering such as the TV ads. Their contribution has not been helpful, to say the least.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke this morning when Senator Boswell was here about the outrageousness of De&hyphen;Anne Kelly's assertions yesterday. And yet I suspect that the fear is this: some people in this country are absolutely petrified that Aboriginal people may treat them in the same way that Aboriginals have been treated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague Senator Bartlett touched, as I will touch, on this issue in his contribution when he asked the question, `Who would like to be treated like Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are treated every day?' I do 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10531"> not see a lot of people in this chamber queuing up to join what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) referred to as the `Aboriginal industry'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment is being moved jointly by the Australian Democrats, the WA Greens and the Australian Labor Party and indicates for us on this side of the chamber at least that we do know something, even though we can never absolutely enter into that experience of how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are treated in this country. We would not want it for ourselves or our children, and we are not prepared to accept it for anyone else. The Racial Discrimination Act should not only apply to this legislation but also, as is the view of the Australian Democrats, be a constitutional prohibition. The question remains: why is the coalition government of this country not prepared to support this amendment? Perhaps, if I put it in the positive, I may appeal to them in fact to do so.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I just forewarn Senator Bolkus that I would not mind his explaining this quite innocent question: what is the difference in the wording between the original ALP amendment on this issue and the new amendment? I would like to know, and I think the committee should know, why the wording is different, the effect of the wording and what is being sought with the new provision as opposed to the old one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with this whole area is that we can all indulge in the political rhetoric of accusing each other of being racially discriminatory and saying that each other's legislation is just that. It becomes an endless political roundabout. In this parliament, we have to worry about the legal effect of the decisions we make. We are not here to just commit expressions of political intent and goodwill and make ourselves all feel good. We pass laws which directly affect the lives of every Australian, have significant legal consequences which give rise to legal rights and result in those rights being pursued in the courts of Australia, and have, as I say, dramatic impact upon the legal rights and obliga

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are most concerned about the legal effect of this provision, and I can point to no greater source for the concern we share about the considerable uncertainty which such a proposition would entail than the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee when it investigated the Native Title Bill 1993, which was chaired by none other than Senator Barney Cooney, who I regret has left the chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will continue my remarks because we have been having cognate debates about these matters and speaking to the subject matters raised. As has been pointed out, quite rightly, there is only one amendment in this batch, so I am putting the government's position on this as a general issue and, obviously, by implication, on the amendment itself, and there is only one. I will requote what the committee&mdash;that is, the Labor majority&mdash;said on this committee:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This should not provide that the Bill is subject to the RDA because of the uncertainty that would create&mdash;contrary to one of the very basic objectives of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not think I could have put it better than Senator McKiernan and Senator Evans, who are in this chamber right now. They thought it was `contrary to one of the very basic objectives of the legislation'&mdash;that is, it provides certainty&mdash;to make the bill subject to the RDA, no doubt because they, then in government, acted quite responsibly in recognising the extraordinary legal uncertainty that flows from having one piece of federal legislation subject to the provisions of another piece of federal legislation in the way this amendment suggests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really would be fascinated to have Senator Evans, Senator McKiernan and Senator Cooney&mdash;regrettably, Senator Reynolds is still overseas&mdash;explain exactly why they can now support an amendment which they, in 1993, said should not be done because of `the uncertainty it would create&mdash;contrary to one of the very basic objectives of the legislation'. I remind you that the ALP has said repeatedly that certainty is one of the basic objectives that it wishes to bring to the consideration of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also point to other legal opinion on this proposition. Professor Tony Blackshield 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 26 November as saying that the outcome of parliament adopting Labor's RDA clause would be for the judges to give the present bill little or no legal effect. He said it would be:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a very odd consequence, but I still think it's what would follow.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then we have S.E.K. Hume QC saying that the Labor RDA clause would produce `profound uncertainty' and tie up parts of the bill in the High Court for decades. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I very much doubt if anyone can see an advance of the outcome of each of those situations where conflict might exist.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have no doubt that the Labor members of the committee in 1993 recognised that very point. You suggest that the position would then be that you go through all the provisions of the Native Title Act, you ensure the validity of whatever you propose to do in relation to a future act&mdash;be it mining, residential development, fishing licences or whatever&mdash;you comply in every respect with the NTA, but you then have a situation where anyone can challenge the validity of that act on the grounds that it may be inconsistent with the RDA. What we are talking about here is giving grounds for legal challenge to everything done under the Native Title Act which otherwise is the mechanism by which you determine whether things can validly be done that impact or affect native title. It would be a disastrous proposition. It would render useless the Native Title Act as a mechanism by which the Commonwealth parliament is attempting to provide certainty in relation to the doing of future acts on land on which native title may have survived.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party clearly understand that. This is a political exercise that is now being proposed. It is not one that they were prepared to pursue in government, quite properly and responsibly, but with the luxury of opposition they are now indulging in the politics of this issue rather than dealing with the hard&hyphen;core issue of passing legislation that does provide certainty to Australians. So I think this should be seen for what it is. It would be an absolutely irresponsible amendment for this parliament to pass because of the legal effect of it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10533">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we have repeatedly stated, in a democracy like this you can have political arguments about whether something is racially discriminatory or not forever and a day. We are absolutely resolute in our view that this bill taken as a whole is not racially discriminatory, and what we have done is maintain the relationship between the bill and the RDA that is provided for in the current Native Title Act on the recommendation of such esteemed men as the chairman of the committee and Senator Evans&mdash;that nothing in this bill shall affect the operation of the RDA.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to acknowledge the Jennifer Clarke article, `The  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 : A different form of uncertainty', published by the Centre for Aboriginal Eco 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nomic Policy Research in November this year for forming the foundation to my introductory comments on this very important issue. The issue of racial discrimination goes to the very heart of this debate&mdash;and that has been mentioned by other senators. It is the issue which most caring Australians believe makes this bill completely unacceptable. It is one of the legal issues upon which this bill has been continually questioned, and it is the issue which the international community will focus on as they condemn Australia for many years to come if this despicable piece of legislation is passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extent to which the bill discriminates against native title holders may be measured in a number of different ways. Firstly, a law is discriminatory if it prefers the rights of non-Aborigines over those of Aborigines. It is unusual in Australian law for private rights to be removed or suppressed for the benefit of other private land&hyphen;holders. However, this bill benefits other land&hyphen;holders by extinguishing some unextinguished native titles and by giving preference to intermediate period acts, primary production activities and private water and fishing rights over the native title which those rights suppress. The bill's title upgrading provisions extend in time the preference given to other land&hyphen;holders over native title holders in the Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, a law may be discriminatory if it fails to provide the property rights of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders with protection approaching the protection given other landowners. The bill does this in a number of ways. For example, the bill's confirmation of past extinguishment, validation of intermediate period acts, expansion of primary production activities and privileging of private water and fishing rights are achieved without native title holders' consent in circumstances where other landowners' consent would have been sought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of validation of intermediate period acts, native title holders' compensation entitlements may be set at a discriminatory level. The bill authorises on native title land, mining and fossicking which would not be permitted on private land but deprives those native title holders of both landowners' 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10534"> objection rights and the right to negotiate. Similarly, native title holders whose right to negotiate is cut off by ministerial intervention are denied both sets of objection rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill sometimes requires native title to be treated like an inferior right to land. This is the case under those amendments which allowed substitution of the right to negotiate by state laws applicable to current or former non-exclusive freehold, leasehold or public use reserves. It is also the case under amendments allowing the use for primary production activities of off&hyphen;farm land subject to native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, discrimination should also be measured by the bill's failure to provide substantive equality via appropriately different treatment of unique aspects of Aboriginal culture. A right to negotiate is an important response to the special relationship between Aboriginal people and land. Its time frames should make allowances for considered and unhurried Aboriginal decision making processes, and its content should reflect something of the Aboriginal sense of obligation to land and the need for participation in traditional land management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right should not be made inaccessible in an unduly strict registration test or rendered meaningless by ministerial intervention, nor should it be wound back by reference to non-Aboriginal concepts of land history or significance&mdash;for example, the distinction between towns and other areas or the distinction between land previously reserved or alienated and other crown land. Similarly, protection of the intertidal zone should reflect something of the significance to that area to Aboriginal people, not its insignificance in non-Aboriginal culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There seems to be no doubt to us that this bill is inconsistent with the international law standards embodied in the Racial Discrimination Act. Even if this inconsistency does not raise constitutional issues, it does raise international law issues and important questions about the credibility of assertions that the bill and the Racial Discrimination Act are consistent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This discrimination could generate successful complaints to United Nations human rights 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bodies, with associated negative international attention. Once again, we will see the government attacking the United Nations. Further, although international law will not prevent parliament enacting the bill, the bill will operate as an implied repeal of the Racial Discrimination Act. Assertions about the `consistency' of the bill and the Racial Discrimination Act should be assessed in this context: the two will only be consistent because the bill runs down the Racial Discrimination Act standard, allowing discrimination against Aboriginal property rights under both Commonwealth and consistent state and territory laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Greens have stated repeatedly over the last month, in order to encourage genuine non-discrimination&mdash;as opposed to opportunistic political use of non-discrimination law concepts&mdash;the Commonwealth government should withdraw this bill and commence meaningful negotiations with indigenous groups regarding future amendment of the Native Title Act. Unfortunately, this most reasonable course of action was considered too time consuming by the government and perhaps, more importantly, the mining industry. Therefore, Australia will stand forever labelled as a country which refuses to pay even the most cursory respect to its first peoples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard Senator Minchin attempting to explain, in his now familiar double-speak, how this bill is not racially discriminatory, despite all the evidence to the contrary. Besides, why shouldn't the government be able to make laws in any way it likes? Senator Minchin, if this is the case, you have no reason not to support the Racial Discrimination Act amendment being proposed by the non-government parties. If you are so sure, if you are prepared to stand before the people of Australia and say that this bill is not racially discriminatory, then back up your words with support for a proposed section in this bill which makes it subject to the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment has explicitly excluded the validation provisions that this Senate passed in an act of shame. I would like to place on the public record that, in agreeing to support 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10535"> this amendment, I do not condone the validation provisions. Their exclusion from this amendment in itself proves that the validation provisions are discriminatory, and I in no way, shape or form support this massive extinguishment of native title rights. However, the political reality is such that in order to reach some level of non-government consensus on the issue of including a Racial Discrimination Act provision, it has been worded in this form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate that the government has not seen fit to offer anywhere near the same level of compromise at any stage in this debate. Quite frankly, we are going to continue having this debate on legislation. We are going to see governments on both sides pushing the limits of the High Court from time to time until we start mentioning in Australia what it is necessary to have in a constitution leading into the next century. We need to have a constitution which does ensure the rights of indigenous Australians. We need to have a constitution which is quite clear on human rights and things like ecological sustainability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until we do this, we are going to continue to have this kind of awful legislation put forward and shoved through. Groups like indigenous Australians, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, will be used as a political football in this scapegoat, politically opportune method of dealing with the concerns of people in the bush. Their concerns, in reality, have nothing whatsoever to do with native title. Their concerns are real, but their viability has nothing whatsoever to do with native title and, in reality, the government know it. What are they going to do when they run out of excuses?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would like to commend the amendment which is in the combined names of the Greens, the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party. I think there really is no reason why the Senate should not support this amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there are a few points that need to be answered. Senator Minchin asked some questions, and I think there are some other items that need to go on the record as well. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator Minchin asked what the difference was in respect of this particular amendment and the previously circulated Labor amendment on this issue. I think the only difference of substance is that this amendment applies to the whole act as amended, whereas the previous amendment only applied to the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we are doing is importing the beneficial aspects of the previous legislation and the previous special measure regime. In fact, we are being generous to the government's bill in that we allow that bill to be judged in the context of the whole act and the whole arrangement at the time. So I think it does something which is of benefit to the government's interests. If the interest is solely certainty, it does that as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have always argued that the initial act was in accordance with the Racial Discrimination Act. With respect to the High Court in Western Australia and the Commonwealth, on page 483 of the judgment, the six judges say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the first place, it is not easy to detect any inconsistency between the Native Title Act and the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think it lays an extra plank of foundation under the government's legislation to have the RDA apply in the broader context of the amended act rather than just in respect of this particular bill, which the previous amendment was to target.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You make the point also as to why we did not do it when we were in government and why we ask now for it to be done in this particular circumstance. I think there are a number of things to be said in respect of that. I do not think the concern at the time was anywhere near as strong as it is now. Indigenous Australians, for instance, were in agreement with the measures. That agreement was also quite important in the courts' consideration as to the non&hyphen;discriminatory nature of the previous legislation. Compare that with the widespread concerns about this legislation and its non-adherence to non&hyphen;discriminatory principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we did try in 1993. The High Court in that very same case took the view that, although we did try, we obviously did not try enough. I think it is fair to say that in 1993 we should have been a bit clearer about 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10536"> what we meant by section 7. I do not deny that. My view at the time also was that we could have been a little more forceful in our non&hyphen;discriminatory section 7 of the act at that time. But I do go back to the point that, at that time, there was nowhere near the concern that there is now as to the nature of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of that concern, the concern seems to emanate only from the grounds of uncertainty. I did make the point at the start that the effect of this provision would be twofold. As we know, Commonwealth laws override state laws as to any inconsistency under section 109 of the constitution. Obviously this provision would have an impact on what the states are allowed to do under your legislation. I think that is an extremely important safeguard to put in place here. It has an important role in ensuring that states, in the devolution of power from the Commonwealth to the states, act in accordance with non&hyphen;discriminatory principles. It is the best guarantee we can provide from this level to ensure that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of Commonwealth legislation, what this provision would do would be not to strike out that legislation, but to have that legislation read in accordance with non&hyphen;discriminatory principles. Your concerns as to uncertainty are a little overblown in this circumstance. It is important for us&mdash;when we give the states the capacity to set up tribunals, the capacity to set up mechanisms for regimes for extinguishment, and so much say in the process&mdash;that we have the safety net that this legislation does not allow for discriminatory practices to take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a political exercise. Senator Minchin said a rather curious thing. He said, `Let's get back to law making and let's get away from political exercise.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We were all amazed, but the point that cannot be left unchallenged is that when we passed the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975 we were making a law. That law made it very clear that we expected people in this diverse society to act in a non&hyphen;discriminatory manner. Law&hyphen;making does 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> include essential legislation such as the Racial Discrimination Act. It does not just extend to the Buffalo Slaughter Levy Bill 1997 for instance.

Don't try to argue that this is purely a political exercise and that we ought to go back to the real men's business of making law. Let's give it a break. Let's acknowledge that one of the most important laws passed in this parliament this century was the 1975 Racial Discrimination Act. It has governed the behaviour of parliaments and of governments since, and it needs to go on governing the behaviour not just of parliaments but of all of us in this place and, hopefully, in the place across the way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are debating a fundamental issue. It is fundamental as to its symbolism. It is fundamental as to the protection it gives on the ground. It is also fundamental as to how this parliament, particularly this Senate, is seen by history. We have been warned time and time again that the provisions that we have adopted may be discriminatory. This Senate has a choice between picking up a lot of those amendments and dismissing those concerns, though sometimes with a degree of anguish. We will be held accountable. The matter will go to courts and courts will make a judgment on us. The matter will go to international tribunals and international tribunals will make a judgement on us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter will be discussed in international fora and those fora will make a judgment on us, as we have made judgments on them, and we have made judgments on them in accordance with the regime of the convention on the elimination of racial discrimination. It is a regime that we were quite fundamental in formulating in the early days of the United Nation. We were there at the birth of this particular convention. In fact, we were probably one of those major parties responsible for it. The rest of the world will say to us as a nation, `It `s your principles that we're applying, but your parliament has not even seen fit to apply those principles that have been universally accepted for some decades now to your legislation.' They may expect that of our 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10537"> Prime Minister and they may expect it of the government, but I for one do not want to be besmirched in an international assessment of these issues by being associated without distinction with the government of the day on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that when we make this law we should recognise that we have a stake&mdash;a historic stake and a future stake&mdash;in making sure that this law conforms with the standards that we expect of the rest of the world and the standards that we have set for the rest of the world. This is one of those occasions where they will be looking into our backyards. Unfortunately, if we do not pass this provision, the backyard they will be looking into will be the Senate, and we will all be judged accordingly.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I strongly support this amendment. Basic and fundamental to all parties in this debate is being sure that the nature of the legislation which results from this debate does not infringe the rights of any Australians on a racial basis. Let us remember here that, if that is to be the case, there should be no fear that this amendment has been moved to ensure that the Racial Discrimination Act prevails where it may be infringed by the provisions of the legislation that we are debating at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us also remember that this is simply not a mechanism to protect Aboriginal interests. It is a mechanism to protect the interests of all racial components of the Australian community and, as such, there should be nobody who either fears it or believes that it should not be very clearly stated as part of this legislation; that is, that the Racial Discrimination Act has precedence. I want to read a letter from Professor Tony Blackshield of Macquarie University, which encapsulates the argument here very succinctly. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An essential element in the negotiations surrounding the Native Title Act 1993 was the assurance given to Aboriginal negotiators that the full effect of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 would be preserved. But the clause included for that purpose (section 7 of the 1993 Act)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which Senator Bolkus has referred to&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was ineffective. The High Court later said that "It is difficult to identify the legal purpose which this provision is intended to serve".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1997 the present government has again given assurances that its amendments to the 1993 Act will not be inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. To make those assurances meaningful it is essential that a mechanism be provided to ensure that the new amendments&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that we are dealing with now&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">cannot operate in any way that would infringe the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Professor Blackshield goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the absence of such a mechanism the Racial Discrimination Act would be infringed by any amendment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">to this legislation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">detrimental to the common law rights of indigenous Australians. However, the effect of that impairment would simply be that the new amendments would take effect&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, would be discriminatory&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and to that extent the Racial Discrimination Act would have been repealed. This is because when the courts are faced with two inconsistent Acts of the same Parliament, the normal rule is that the courts will give effect to the later Act. The earlier Act will be regarded as impliedly repealed to the extent of the inconsistency.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is, if there is a conflict between what we are passing here today and the Racial Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act is, in effect, repealed. Professor Blackshield continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the government's position is that it does not intend to repeal the Racial Discrimination Act, it is essential that it includes a mechanism to avoid the possibility of an implied repeal. That is the intention of the Greens' amendment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The proposed mechanism is going to be workable. The effect is that through this amendment we are making it clear that the Racial Discrimination Act is not repealed. We have heard no argument from the government that would counteract that. I do want to say this: right across this nation decent Australians will see the merit in this amendment. Right across the country people who are of good faith on all sides of the argument will see the justification in us insisting that the Racial Discrimination Act not be repealed in so far as this legislation is concerned but be confirmed through this amendment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10538">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be a statement in itself were the Senate to fail to pass this amendment. You cannot get around it, Senator Minchin. If you believe, as the Prime Minister has said, that the Racial Discrimination Act will not be infringed by this legislation, then you ought to support this amendment. You can have no fear of it. Anybody who sees the government failing to support this amendment has the right to infer from that that the government does inherently believe that there is the risk, if not the clear reality, that this legislation will infringe the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has throughout called for certainty. It has used the word `certainty' as a foundation of its argument for its 10-point plan and for this legislation. Above certainty, Australians do not want to see discrimination against people as an outcome. That is why this amendment is so important. It says: let us not leave any doubt and let us not cavil about our commitment to ensure there is no discrimination. Worse still, let us not mince our words. But let us be clear, direct and simple in uniting in this place, all of us, to make it clear that we do not want racial discrimination as an outcome of this legislation in any way. We want to make it clear not just to the courts and not just to those people most affected by this legislation but to this nation that there is no way this legislation will be allowed to discriminate against any Australian, not least the original indigenous Australian people of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an extremely important amendment. I would expect the government is going to support it. It is a matter of great principle that the government does support it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that, given the history since 1993, given the fact that this bill has become a symbol, and given the fact that there could be an election where the racial issue is a very big one, we, as a parliament, ought to say quite clearly now that no matter what other people might say about the history of this bill, or what other people might say about any coming election, we do not in any way tolerate racial distinction. It might be, therefore, proper for us to put this in this bill that we are about to make an act. Given the history of what has happened since 1993, given the history of the debate about this issue, and given the fear that the coming election has for people, and properly so, it seems to me that we might have a racial divide in the community. It is incumbent upon this parliament to put something in this bill to indicate that we will stick by the Racial Discrimination Act no matter what.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of issues have been raised about the difficulty of administering this bill if it became an act because the bureaucrats administering it would have to worry about the act all the time. I want to say a couple of things about that. First, in recent times we passed the  Public Service Bill 1997  and the  Parliamentary Service Bill 1997 . This legislation, in effect, set out mission statements such as: we want public servants to be honest, we want them to be polite to people, and we want them to do their job in a proper way. All of these objectives, which were very vague and which you would think would be very hard to administer, passed through this chamber without any trouble. We say that they are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10539"> aspirations that you ought to aspire to. Even though these objectives are not expressed in detail, nevertheless they give a flavour to the way that people administer the regulations when they are written, which will make things better. We set out certain principles for the Public Service. Although those principles may be vague and general, we did not have any worries about them being difficult to administer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have consulted the person in Australia who, perhaps, best understands native title. That is Ron Castan. He is a man of great integrity, as everybody agrees, and great generosity. But it was not those qualities that I was looking for; it was his legal mind. I think everybody agrees that he has a great legal mind and knows this area of the law perhaps better than anyone. Indeed, he would adorn the High Court&mdash;not in any partisan way, but because of his mind. He says that the insertion of a provision vindicating the Racial Discrimination Act is essential and would not interfere with the proper administration of the act. I am very conscious of the need for the bill to be framed in such a way that it is able to be used properly. I know there are some great concerns about that. But when you have the precedents of the  Public Service Bill 1997  and the  Parliamentary Service Bill 1997  and the opinion of someone like Ron Castan, I think the answer to our problems is to insert this provision.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To take up the point that has just been made by Senator Cooney: he sees this as a means of keeping the states honest and keeping them on the track. That is something that has exercised my mind considerably. Various bodies are to be established in the various states and clearly Commonwealth law overrides state law to the extent of any inconsistency. If the RDA proposal that is put before us goes into the legislation then that would serve not so much as a block but as a threat overhanging the states in respect of these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>

They can ensure that the measures we have decided upon in this legislation and in the 1993 legislation are given proper effect to, as we want them to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have approached this matter, as no doubt everybody else has, with a mind to what the RDA says to ensure that this measure is not a discriminatory measure based on racial discrimination. I have approached every one of the amendments and all of the legislation that has come before us on that basis. A different view has been expressed by Senator Margetts in this debate. She indicated in her contribution that she is of the view that this measure that we will finish adopting today is inconsistent with the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. That is the view that has been strongly stated here. If Senator Margetts has made that statement, I assume that it is the view of a number of people. She indicated that she consulted a number of people on these matters. I respect her views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am saying that this measure we have before us today is really a huge invitation to constant, endless litigation. It is not going to do anybody any good.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning, Senator Harradine told us that he had moved to accept 90 per cent of the Howard government's position on this. He also said that he had made a decision two weeks ago to adopt the minimalist position&mdash;that is, the same thing. I read that as meaning that he has made a decision to go as far as the government requires to let this legislation go through, whatever the cost might be to the indigenous people of this nation of getting this government legislation through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we get down to the nitty&hyphen;gritty, the question is: are we legislating in a way which discriminates against the indigenous people of this country? I maintain that any member of this committee who cannot support the Racial Discrimination Act prevailing where there is uncertainty about that matter is courting discrimination as an outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are worried about that, you put the lid on. You do not worry about the political consequences, and you do not argue about what the opposition did in government or the government did in opposition. Senator Minchin said that we should put this above politics. We have heard talk, as Senator Cooney said, about the possibility of a race based election. Great fear has been expressed about that by political leaders, including the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you were going to ensure that people had some confidence that this legislation was not racially discriminatory, you would accept this amendment. That is simple logic. That cannot be countermanded. For Senator Harradine, or any members of the government opposite, to say that the Racial Discrimination Act ought not be clearly invoked as the arbiter of whether or not any component of this legislation is discriminatory, flies in the face of logic and the standard of commitment to the indigenous people of this country to a fair go and to making sure that we do not have discrimination, as I would expect in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Involved in this is an effort at all costs by the arbiter, Senator Harradine, to meet the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10541"> government at a point where this legislation may get through. The big losers in this at&hyphen;all&hyphen;costs move are the indigenous people of this country. I do not think it is a matter of goodwill to the indigenous people that we say in a majority here, as it appears the vote is going to be, that we cannot defend you through the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine, I do not buy the argument that you can leave it to good ministers, particularly at state level. I do not buy this bringing in of the states rights issue as a means of defeating the rights of anybody to be protected from racial discrimination. The High Court has already said that the previous attempt to protect indigenous interests in the 1993 legislation was ineffectual. Senator Harradine and the government are saying here, `Let's leave it ineffectual.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are a fair&hyphen;minded person and, in particular, if you are a member of the indigenous community in this country, how are you to read that? You read it this way: this legislation is inimical to your interests in some ways. We know that. You have said through your representatives that you do not want the government's legislation adopted. You have enumerated the ways in which it discriminates against your interests but, in this pivotal moment in this debate, Senator Harradine is failing those interests, and the government is failing those interests.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter that I wish to raise in this afternoon's matter of public interest debate concerns an article entitled `Lawyers trim the truth to join the backyard scare campaign' that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  yesterday. The article makes the assertion that a number of lawyers in this place were engaged in trimming the truth in relation to the issue of freehold title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that there can be genuine differences of opinion in relation to the legal consequences. But it is unacceptable for not even commentators&mdash;advocates&mdash;to start writing in the terms that were submitted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> yesterday. To make the assertion that some lawyers in this place, including me, knew different from what we were arguing about is unacceptable and demeaning of the profession of journalism. In making the attack, not a single word was printed in inverted commas as to what we actually said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The article deliberately left out the views of other senior lawyers that were well known to the writer of the article. People such as John Greenwood QC do not rate a mention. What about the views of his Honour Chief Justice Brennan of the High Court in his dissenting judgment in Wik on page 30? It must have been known. But, no, we cannot put the other side because, if we were simply to put the other side in the debate, it would suggest to the public that there were two sides to the argument that could be rationally and genuinely argued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not say that the view I have been putting in relation to freehold title is necessarily right. What I am saying, and what the government has been saying, is that there is the possibility. If there is that possibility, then there is uncertainty within the community. If you have that uncertainty, what better way to get rid of it than by having legislation to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10542"> ensure that what everybody allegedly asserts is the law is simply enshrined in the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I quote a letter to the editor of John Greenwood QC in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> of 2 December 1997. May I just add for the record that this Mr Greenwood QC acted for the Thayorre people in the Wik case, arguing in favour of the ultimate decision that arose in Wik. His letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present position seems to be that, although Australians can be confident that a grant of freehold extinguishes native title, it is not a 100 per cent certainty and will not become a 100 per cent certainty until the reasoning in the US and some Canadian authorities . . . is rejected by the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Everybody who has argued the Mabo and Wik decisions acknowledges that a lot of the jurisprudence which has now been introduced into Australian law has its foundations in the developments of the common law of both Canada and the United States. In both those jurisdictions, the Supreme Courts have found the possibility&mdash;and made actual findings&mdash;of native title actually existing on freehold title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are following down that course of jurisprudence in developing our common law along those similar lines, then it stands to reason that one day a similar finding may be made by the High Court. It is interesting that, in this article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, we are told:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lawyers <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">know</EMPHASIS>  how to read a High Court judgment. They <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">know</EMPHASIS>  the basis of Mabo is that white freehold&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have not heard of black freehold; I am not sure what is meant by that, but nevertheless&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">extinguishes native title.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is a very clever piece of advocacy but it completely and utterly ignores the development in the Wik case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who wrote the main judgment in the Mabo decision? None other than Justice Brennan, as he then was. Who wrote the chief dissenting judgment in the Wik decision? None other than Chief Justice Brennan. He said this on page 30 of his decision, in disagreeing with the Wik decision:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And, if leases were of that character, an estate in fee simple would be no different. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the logic in the mind of Chief Justice Brennan is this:  that the logic of the majority decision of Wik, if logically followed through, could well mean that freehold title could be similarly affected; and, at the moment, I doubt that the High Court would make that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I say to the Senate that Justice Brennan in the Mabo decision doubted, as everybody else at the time doubted&mdash;including then Senator Gareth Evans, Senator Bob Collins and the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating&mdash;after the Mabo decision that native title could be found to exist on pastoral leases. But, with a change of personnel in the High Court, we have different people deciding things differently&mdash;which they are quite entitled to do. We got a different and, indeed, unexpected decision in the Wik case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is the guarantee to the Australian people that, with further changes to the personnel in the High Court, the logical consequence which the Chief Justice pointed to will not arise? I do not mind journalists and other people putting forward their point of view, just as long as they fairly report the argument that the other side are putting forward. They can put their own spin on it at the end and then let the readers decide. But not to allow one word of the authorities that were being relied upon is dishonest or trimming the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As time is short, I cannot make all the points that I wish to make. In conclusion, I indicate that I have responded to the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> by way of letter to the editor. Part of my letter reads as follows:</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Seeing they have now succeeded on pastoral leases, does it not follow, according to Noel Pearson's logic, that they must therefore also be successful on freehold titles? I then quoted Chief Justice Brennan, who I have already referred to.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The fifth point I made was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The common law developments of native title in Australia was guided by overseas jurisprudence especially in Canada and the U.S.A. In both those jurisdictions native title has been found to exist on freehold title;</PARA>

In essence, the germane part of the question was whether or not Senator Minchin, who is now responsible for the Electoral Act, would outlaw overseas donations&mdash;that is, that donations to political parties that are sourced outside Australia would be banned as a matter of course as soon as amendments to the Electoral Act are dealt with in this place and the other place.</PARA></TALK.START>

Indeed, when I asked that question I noted that Senator Ferguson, who had been the president of the South Australian branch, had been roped in as well. The preamble to the question indicated that there was some difference between Senator Ferguson and Senator Minchin on these points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I inform the Senate that that was wrong; that part of the question was not correct. Senator Ferguson&mdash;and I apologise to him for this&mdash;in fact was not the President of the South Australian Liberal Party when the Catch Tim and Moriki donations were made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have more information on this matter, because one of the obvious things that happens when you ask a question in this place or somewhere else is that various members of the Liberal Party make sure you are kept up to date with all sorts of information.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am dismayed by this extraordinary and gutless attempt to divert the blame for this debacle onto me and Grahame Morris, who were the respective Directors at the time the donations in question were received, and I am exercising my right to refute this attack.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The attack on Grahame Morris is particularly stupid, given his current role as political adviser to John Howard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The relevant facts are these:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was State Director at the time the Moriki Products donation was received in February `93. I was succeeded by Grahame Morris in May `93, who was State Director at the time the Catch Tim donation was received in November `93. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In February `93 I was occupied full-time with running the Federal Campaign in SA for the March election. The President and Treasurer, with the Finance Committee, had responsibility for the fundraising that took place during the campaign, and subsequently took credit for the amount raised. I was not involved in fundraising during the campaign. (It should be noted that most of the money raised in SA for the Federal campaign was raised through the "Hewson for PM" campaign when Alan Ferguson was President and James Porter the Acting Treasurer).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is why the other day we assumed they were the two relevant gentlemen at that particular point. In fact, that is not so. In the case of Alan Ferguson, as I have said to the Senate before, I certainly apologise for roping him into the question. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I was advised in February `93 that $50,000 had been donated by a Singapore company called Moriki Products, I naturally asked about the donor and the reason for the donation. I was assured that it was "a Gerard Industries donation".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given my campaign responsibilities, I accepted the explanation and did not make further inquiries. While very uncomfortable about overseas donations (this being the only one I was aware of in my 8 years as Director) I accepted Mr Gerard's right to donate to the Party via a Singapore entity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my 8 years as State Director, I never knew of the existence of, let alone met Mr Bill Henderson, who we now know apparently obtained the Moriki and Catch Tim donations for the Party.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is under the hand of Senator Minchin, who clears not only the role of himself in this particular matter but also the role of Senator Ferguson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin, in my experience of him, has always been an honourable man. Indeed, he had nothing to do with the overseas donations. Any imputation that people have against Senator Minchin because they think he may have been the conduit for these questionable overseas donations&mdash;they were quite controversial when they were declared&mdash;and may have had an association should not be taken because Senator Minchin had nothing to do with it. In fact, he makes it quite clear in his communication that he did not want anything to do with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other document we have here is under the hand of the Minister for Justice, Senator Amanda Vanstone. We start to find out what was happening on 5 April 1995. I will quote 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10545"> from a memo to state councillors from the minister. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to you to express my concern at some recent press reports in relation to the so-called Catch Tim matter. I am writing to you because I am unable to be at State Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You may have seen an article by John Ferguson in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The</EMPHASIS>  <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>  on Saturday. I have attached a copy in case you missed it. I've also attached a copy of an article by Philip White from several weeks ago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both these articles demonstrate only too clearly that we still have people amongst us who are not prepared to work together as a team. Rather than playing as a team, they background and leak information to the press that is designed to damage fellow Liberals, in this case, Vickie Chapman and Dean Brown.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Everyone knows who Dean Brown was. Vickie Chapman was the President of the Liberal Party's South Australian division when the donations came in. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The temptation is of course to return the favour and once that spiral starts, any semblance of unity is lost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No-one need imagine that Catch Tim was an issue in the last fortnight of sittings in Federal Parliament, nor that the idea for the article came like a bolt out of the blue to John Ferguson.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Equally, with respect to the Philip White article, what kind of person would bother to give that kind of detailed information to a gossip columnist?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps you can imagine how depressing and frustrating it is to see these sorts of articles. To me, it's just another example of a limited few who speak with forked tongues. Their calls for unity appear to be nothing more than a smokescreen behind which they can go on with their endless pursuit of personalities, who they, for one reason or another, have a gripe against.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For most of the ten years I have been in Parliament, State Councillors and Branch Members have bemoaned what has appeared to be a lack of unity in the Party. No-one needs to be reminded how damaging disunity can be.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unity will only come in reality when people actually demonstrate their preparedness to work together for the common goal of winning. That's why in any leadership contest, I have always looked to who I thought would do the best job, rather than whether they were a personality from any one particular viewpoint in the Party.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The letter goes on to bemoan the whole thing. In fact, this was the article that was quoted in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>  of that particular day.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand why the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, got up in such a hurry to have this particular issue put down and have the question ruled out of order. What was really going on&mdash;we did not realise it until we were fully briefed afterwards&mdash;was that it was Senator Hill's side of the Liberal Party that was trying to shove the Catch Tim-Moriki donations onto poor old Senator Ferguson and in particular Senator Minchin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Amanda Vanstone letter was seeking to do was to say that it was the Dean Brown side of the equation&mdash;that is, Dean Brown and Vickie Chapman, who was then the president of the division. It was seeking to say&mdash;when they received the money&mdash;that it was really the fault of a past president and it was really the fault of a very uncomfortable state director at that time and his successor, Grahame Morris, who would have to take the wrap for these particular donations. In fact, it was nothing of the sort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was Amanda Vanstone's very good friend, Mr Gerard, from Gerard Industries&mdash;under various names and aliases which we took several months to track down&mdash;who was responsible for the donations and it was the Dean Brown crowd that took pleasure not only in announcing how much money they raised for the 1993 state election but also that particular crew had to wear the publicity and the storm that went through the party and the media when all this came out. Then on 5 April, they obviously tried to unload this particular bucket of excrement all over innocent parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other day the question we asked, from very limited documents, indicated that we had, in part, thought there was some truth in the proposition that Senator Minchin and Senator Ferguson were involved in it. They were not involved in it at all&mdash;very far from it. Senator Hill quickly got to his feet. Senator Hill is a very quick, sharp and shrewd man and I have a great deal of respect for him. He understood where this was going and knew, far better than I, where it was going&mdash;right to the heart of the little clique that ran the Liberal Party in South Australia at that time and surrounded Premier Dean Brown and his 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10546"> good mate from just over the other side of the railway lines at Gerard Industries. They were picking up as many dollars as they could from whatever questionable sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, had they not been so cocky and called the thing `Catch Tim', I do not think they would have drawn anyone's attention to it. I guess that will be something, when the next lot of donations come out, at which we will have to look more closely. I am sure some people have learnt a few lessons in the meantime.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been listening fairly closely to this part of the debate and I give my congratulations to those of you who have had to stick through every detail of this entire bill. I have listened closely to this stage because I think it is a very important one. The joint amendment of the Democrats, opposition and green parties is one that I think a lot of attention is being paid to. I think it is important that the arguments on both sides are clearly put and able to be understood, regardless of what actual view each of us has about the merits of our own position. Certainly, when I go back to my electorate, I would like to be able to explain in a reasonably clear way why various decisions were taken, particularly on this one, because it is an important one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are actually debating whether or not a line should be put in to specify that this Native Title Act is to be construed as subject to the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. I would like to ask Senator Harradine one or two questions so that he can elaborate on his previous comments. I did listen closely to the explanations he was giving, but I was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not totally clear on a couple of bits and I wanted to get clarification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were two main points. One was his concern about the potential for a lawyers picnic if this amendment was agreed to. Certainly nobody wants a lawyers picnic but, on my understanding of how this would operate, putting this clause in would not necessarily mean that a whole lot of extra court cases would suddenly appear with people challenging the act. I would have thought that this would operate as a guide to the courts and tribunals when they are considering the operation of the Native Title Act in all the various ways that it is going to operate in the future. I am not sure why this particular clause would generate a whole lot of extra legal contests. I would have thought it would be a useful guide for legal issues that are going to happen anyway. I would appreciate some clarification on that, and perhaps from the minister as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point was my understanding of what Senator Harradine was saying about the alternative approach which would work if we had vigorous ministers&mdash;I think that was his phrase&mdash;or ministers who were vigorously pursuing and monitoring the operation of things to make sure that indigenous interests were upheld. If my understanding of that is correct, I seek an indication from Senator Harradine that he is confident that the ministers at the federal level will be sufficiently vigorous in pursuing that. Even if that is the case, I do not know what the state ministers are like in Tasmania but I certainly would not be highly confident of the relevant ministers at state level in Queensland putting a lot of energy into ensuring that indigenous interests are protected. In this debate, my colleague Senator Woodley has spoken a number of times about things that have happened in the past, which I think would indicate that my concern is reasonably well founded, particularly under previous National Party&hyphen;led governments but also, to a lesser extent, under the previous Goss administration. So I would like to get some clarification, at least, about the rationale behind the alternative position.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take the opportunity to respond to what was at least inferentially a question to me as well about the legal difficulties of this proposal. I did outline them in my first remarks on this, but you have to remember that the Native Title Act is a Commonwealth piece of legislation which applies now to 79 per cent of Australia in effect&mdash;more if the Greens were to have their way. Everywhere that native title may have survived, the Native Title Act applies. It is the relevant law. Anything done on 79 per cent of Australia that does not comply with the Native Title Act in some way or other is potentially invalid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the most massive federal intervention ever in the land management systems of Australia by the Commonwealth parliament. Everything that is proposed to be done on 79 per cent of Australia must comply with that act or it can be asserted to be invalid. That is why the act is so big. It has to allow for so many different circumstances. This is a nation of 18 million people with a highly productive economy and with things going on in that land all the time. Everything that is done must comply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of the Native Title Act, and the reason why you have to have a native title act, is to provide the requisite certainty as to what is valid and invalid with regard to native title. It is the rule book with which everybody who operates on land must comply&mdash;all the governments, every mining company, every farmer and everybody who does anything on land. If you do not comply with it, then your actions are invalid. If the mining industry, for example, were about to invest in a multibillion dollar mine it has to know that there is no sovereign risk to its investment. It has to know that the title it secures is a valid title, otherwise its whole investment is at risk, as is everything it does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This applies right across the board to everybody doing anything on that 79 per cent of Australia where native title may have survived. There must be a certain rule book. As I mentioned before, the ALP recognised that in 1993. Their own Senate committee 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> said that subjecting the provisions of what was then the Native Title Bill to the Racial Discrimination Act should not be done because of the uncertainty that would create, contrary to one of the very basic objectives of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The uncertainty derives from the fact that everything otherwise validly done under the Native Title Act is challengeable, as a matter of law, as being inconsistent with or not complying with the Racial Discrimination Act. Anyone who is unhappy about anything done validly under the Native Title Act has a cause of action in bringing a challenge to that otherwise validly issued title on the grounds that it breaches another Commonwealth act, the Racial Discrimination Act. It is not a rule book per se&mdash;it is a broad set of principles based on the principle of non&hyphen;discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anybody who seeks to do things or invest millions is faced not only with all the normal hurdles&mdash;environmental regulations, heritage, state approvals; there is quite a myriad of approvals that are required before you can do anything&mdash;but also has to make sure that their actions are consistent with the Native Title Act. Not only that, once you have got all that approval you cannot get a tick off on the RDA. You are then simply subject to the potential of someone bringing a court action against you on the grounds that what you did&mdash;no matter that it is entirely valid under the rule book, the NTA&mdash;is challengeable on the grounds that it is somehow inconsistent with the RDA, and you must wait for a court to make a determination on that matter. That is why the Labor senators in the Senate committee of 1993 said it is an impossibility. That is why we believe it is an impossibility and it would render this whole bill unworkable.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, certainly. I certainly did get the impression that the bill, or the rights of indigenous people, could or would be defended. Somehow or other, there was the impression that the bill was acceptable to the Senate&mdash;and I would say, acceptable to the majority of the Senate, it might in the end be. But I certainly do not believe you can make that sweeping statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time Senator Harradine said that nobody would disagree that this bill is not for the benefit of indigenous Australians, I did interject and say, `Well, this person does,' and I heard a couple of people more say the same thing. There are vigorous ministers. But it is not possible under the constitution, at least for federal ministers&mdash;for instance, federal ministers for Aboriginal affairs&mdash;to protect indigenous rights after this bill has been enacted, without the Racial Discrimination Act in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are leaving indigenous Australians to the whim of state governments. And we know already what is in the preamble to the Queensland native title bill&mdash;it is basically rubbing its hands with glee. We know that the state government in Western Australia has helped to draft this bill, and it has everything in place ready to go. We do not know the half of what regulations will come out of this bill. In reality, under the constitution, under the powers that exist, if this bill goes through without the Racial Discrimination Act amendment, there is no federal minister who can protect the rights of the indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Racial Discrimination Act provision is not to invalidate the Native Title Act as amended but rather to ensure that indigenous people's rights, under the Native Title Act, are lifted to the level of protection offered by the Racial Discrimination Act. In my opinion, if this act is reducing the rights available under the Racial Discrimination Act, one would have to ask why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will not bring uncertainty. In fact, it is the only certainty that indigenous people can have that they will not be discriminated 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> against on the basis of race. What other assurances have they been given in all of this debate we have had over the last week or so?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are unable to do this, if the votes in the Senate are such that the Racial Discrimination Act amendment before us is not supported, the government and Senator Harradine will be sending a message to the world. That message is that Australia supports racial discrimination; that Australia supports the fact that, when a government gets into government, it should be able to do whatever it darn well likes because it is government; that, as long as the government uses the words `jobs' and `investment', whatever rights it trammels, whatever cultural practices, environmental standards, people's feelings and government inaction, it could and should do whatever it likes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine on many occasions has stood proudly on the issue of human rights&mdash;not just in Australia, but also in other parts of the world. Sadly, most of the bill that the government proposed is still standing; some minor changes have been made to it. But, in terms of human rights, there is no way that anybody could or should stand in this chamber and say that there is nobody who disagrees that this bill is not for the benefit of indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All around this Parliament House, we have representatives from various indigenous bodies and individuals from right around Australia. If we cannot believe them when they say that the bill is not for their benefit, it might be construed as paternalism. If we cannot believe indigenous people when they say that the bill is not for their benefit, who in the end do we believe? Who sets whether or not a bill is of benefit for indigenous people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do we say that only a government can decide whether a bill is of benefit for indigenous people? Remember, that is the way Australia has operated certainly up until the sixties, and many say beyond that. Somebody in government was the one to say what was good and what was bad for indigenous people. That is paternalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we have the right or ability to do here is to try to represent the views of those in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10549"> community who are saying, `No, we cannot allow this injustice to go through unspoken.' We cannot stand in this chamber and say, `The government knows best. Indigenous people don't know what's good for them. What's good for them is to have their rights taken away.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given a choice of having their rights taken away or going to an election, what do you think indigenous Australians are saying to me? They are saying, `Let's have an election.' That is what they are saying to me. I am getting calls, I am getting letters. People are coming to me all the time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have given this further thought, and I have been conscious of what we did in 1983. What we did in 1983 was to include in the Native Title Act provision 7(1), `Nothing in this act affects the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act 1995.' Let me just put a couple of things to rest, first of all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a great deal of concern around the place that there is a new regime, and that much of the power will be devolved from the state. As people know who are speaking about this matter, the argument yesterday was over an issue that I was rather concerned about. That is, that there should be&mdash;and right throughout this debate I have been concerned to ensure that there is&mdash;conformity of administration decision&hyphen;making right throughout Australia, whether of the NNTT or of the state bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did express yesterday, or the day before yesterday, in various conversations with various people my concern about that need and how that could best be achieved. One of those ways is this question of the legislation being subject to the Racial Discrimination Act. I thought that perhaps that might have been too much of a reflection. What I thought I said this morning before lunch was that, if that was not going to be done, one of the ways to ensure that the legislation operates in a proper fashion is by an effective federal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister. I do not know whether you thought I said state ministers. I also said that at a political level in the states it would be important to ensure that the message gets across to the various state ministers. That is the point that I was making. The biggest point this morning was that I had come to the conclusion that, if we did what is being proposed in Senator Bolkus's amendment, the federal government would regard this measure as totally unworkable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose I was encouraged in that belief by what Senator Margetts has been saying on this issue. She indicated in her speech that she believed slabs of this legislation&mdash;she did not use the word `slabs', but whatever word she used&mdash;are inconsistent with the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. I could envisage under those circumstances that there would be huge numbers of cases and endless litigation, and that would do nothing for the certainty that we are trying to achieve here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I said this morning was that this measure was beneficial to Aboriginals. It is beneficial to indigenous native title claimants, because it is better for all stakeholders&mdash;whether they be indigenous people, pastoral leaseholders, miners or whoever&mdash;for this to be done in a way according to statute, which has processes which would be able to achieve results years and years before similar results could be achieved in the courts. Nobody can say that that is not the case, because that is the case. This legislation is important to ensure that these measures are properly determined in accordance with the statute with as much certainty as possible. Otherwise, you leave it to the common law and you leave it to the courts, and that would do nothing for any of the stakeholders. It would mean interminable delays and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had regard to the contribution of my colleague Senator Cooney prior to the suspension of the sitting. I was very interested to hear what Senator Cooney said in view of the fact that he was one of those on the legal and constitutional committee that made the recommendations which were adverted to by Senator Minchin. After having given that consideration, after having regard to what Senator Cooney said and having had further discus 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10550"> sions and considerations over lunch, I am coming to the view that, unless we do what is being proposed&mdash;that is, to have the bill read and construed subject to the provisions of the RDA&mdash;we may be sending the wrong messages to the whole of Australia and to all Australians&mdash;not only indigenous persons but also other people who are likely to require the provisions of this act to resolve problems and issues in a sensible, ordered fashion that I believe is contained in this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel that it would be unwise for the government to maintain the view that it would be unworkable. The view I had come to was that the government would regard it as totally unworkable if the RDA provisions went in. I hope the government will see that, in the end, it is probably better to have the RDA provisions there. We tried it in 1993 in subsection 7(1), which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing in this Act affects the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If we do not have some exceptions for this particular measure here, things like validation could be regarded as being contrary and inconsistent with the RDA provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been expressed around the chamber, subsection 7(1) of the RDA was found by the High Court to be less than operable. That is the message that has been given to us by the High Court. Perhaps we ought to heed that message and include what is being proposed by the opposition in this bill. Otherwise you could have efforts by some people to overturn this measure by stating that the measure is not constitutional under the race power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would rather stick with having cases run pursuant to legislation that this parliament has passed rather than having court cases based on the constitutional race power which might overturn the whole lot. So I do apologise to the committee and indicate now that I am supporting the amendment proposed by the opposition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know that there is all that much need for more debate, but I would like to put two things on the record from this morning's debate. First of all, in introducing this amendment I indicated that we were making this clause apply to the whole act as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amended rather than the bill. I think much of Senator Harradine's argument and Senator Cooney's argument this morning flowed from that as one of the basic points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At one stage Senator Harradine was asking who did not believe that this was a special measure. I do not know what message got down here or what message came from up there, but a number of us might have been identified in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> as indicating that it was not. The point I was making this morning before that part of the debate was that, by applying this particular clause to the whole act, then you would be triggering the special measure provisions that could prevail and were recognised in the High Court in WA and the Commonwealth as doing what Senator Harradine has just said they would do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this provision, you have a mechanism in place where the bill as a whole would be assessed, not individual clauses. When assessing the bill as a whole, the fact that it has already been recognised by the court as having a capacity, I suppose, to constitute a special measure is something that we should take into account. The beneficial nature of the package the first time around, as I said this morning, would also be taken into account. So in the interests of both justice and certainty, I think Senator Harradine's position as he has just spelt it out is spot on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Senator Harradine and others who might be listening to this debate, we have been going for over 41 hours. I think we have probably made a fairly good job of what we have done. We are dealing with both technical legal points and arguments&mdash;highly contestable arguments, political arguments and social arguments. The fact that all of these arguments come together in the legal points that we were discussing before lunch and now should be recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that being recognised, I think people should go to the substantive point that we are going to here: certainty and justice do demand this sort of provision. We got it wrong the first time round and it was not strong enough. This time we are looking at revising that position of 1993 but also doing it in a manner which, under this amendment, gives the government a bit more capacity for its legisla

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To those who might be following this debate, I point out that there is one more topic to go after this one and then we have a degree of housekeeping. We are in the home straight. This is an important part. I suppose we had to have something to follow on the unity of the opposition parties in the previous debate. Let us now go to one where we will not be agreeing with each other; we will go back to the three&hyphen;way spat that we had on one other issue yesterday. It has to be noted that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the 21 different parcels we have only had substantive disagreement on two.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are dealing with here is the government proposal to allow a range of activities to take place on pastoral leases going beyond traditional pastoral uses. This will occur without compulsory acquisition and without the native title holders having the right to negotiate, as would have been the case under the 1993 legislation. The activities that are allowed to go beyond what are current legally available rights to pastoralists have the potential to give them a windfall gain at the expense of not only indigenous Australians but all of us who may have to pay the ultimate burden of compensation due to the impairment of native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill proposes changes which materially diminish native title rights which have been reflected in the Mabo and Wik decisions. In doing so, we think they fail the test of certainty and workability. I am sure, in respect of some of these changes, the government will have to look at amendments in the not too distant future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party proposes an alternative which gives certainty but also gives a degree of justice to indigenous Australians, which is an important consideration in this debate. Our proposal is three tiered. If the pastoralist simply wants to engage in traditional pastoralist activities&mdash;that is, activities and property developments necessarily incidental to the raising and movement of livestock, including pasture improvement, cropping, on&hyphen;farm use, sowing of exotic grasses and partial irrigation&mdash;the legislation should expressly remove any possible uncertainty about the pastoralist's right to engage in those activities. As a consequence, no question would arise about notification or rights to negotiate and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second level would cut in where a pastoralist wanted to go beyond traditional uses to engage in activities like intensive cropping, land clearance, gravel taking, commercial culling or the like. In these circumstances, we propose, as opposed to the government's proposal of giving pastoralists open slather, a regime which ensures a capacity to do what pastoralists can legally do and have a capacity to legally do at the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10552"> moment and which also allows for flexibility to ensure that critical native title interests are promoted and pastoralists cannot go open slather, but, at the same time, they do have a right to keep on doing exactly what they have been doing in these respects in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The elements of the plan are that an application would be made by the pastoralists in these circumstances to the relevant state or territory authority as he or she does now and he or she would ask for the permit in the normal way. The granting of the permission or the interest in question&mdash;whether it is a licence permit or the like&mdash;by such bodies would not be challengeable if done in good faith on familiar agricultural, environmental or planning policy grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notification of the application would be given to rep bodies and registered native title claimants to allow representations to be made on the heritage or other potential significant adverse impacts of the permission sought. It would be made clear that permitted diversification activities would not include major regional irrigation projects, like the proposed Fitzroy River scheme&mdash;a scheme which would significantly change land use over a wide area. Diversification activity would not be permitted under these provisions if it meant that the dominant purpose of the lease was no longer pastoral.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would provide that native title would not be extinguished, but suspended, to use Senator Harradine's word, for the duration of inconsistency, reflecting what we believe will be the common law. Also to the extent that permission or interest granted did adversely impact on native title rights, appropriate compensation would be obtainable from the relevant state or territory. I say the relevant state or territory because it is important to put on them an obligation to be responsible in these matters. In those circumstances the pastoralist would not be personally involved in any way at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then have a third level. In those circumstances where a pastoralist sought a formal upgrading of title to, for instance, a perpetual lease or a freehold type status, the Native Title Act should continue to apply.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We believe that our proposal allows pastoral activities, gives flexibility to allow authorities to permit further diversification in circumstances where native title holders are holders of procedural rights of notification and objection and provides a good balance. We think the government's plan goes too far. It has problems in terms of discrimination, and particularly with reference to the just terms provisions of the constitution. It takes the definition of pastoralists too far. It goes as far as primary production, which we think is too much of a grab. It goes further than the Wik case in terms of the upgrades. Our concern also is that the taxpayer will pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The definition in the tax act of primary production we think is too broad. Off&hyphen;farm activities allowable under the government's scheme are too expansive. We have a qualification on them to ensure protection against excessive overreach. In terms of grants to third parties, the government proposes to allow them to do acts on non&hyphen;exclusive pastoral or agricultural leases. This, for instance, can include giving a third party right to cut and remove timber, extract or remove gravel, quarry, remove rocks or whatever. We believe there should be some control there. We note that the most recent government amendment clarifies the position in respect of some off&hyphen;farm activities, but all it really does is indicate that you cannot do them without formal permission. We do not reckon that is good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have a number of concerns. We do not believe that the compensation just terms provisions of the constitution are met. In terms of notification, the provisions there are not good enough. We do not see that there are adequate procedural rights in the government's proposal. Without those adequate procedural rights, the government will have immediate constitutional problems under the just terms provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other problem we have is that once again here we have the government allowing the removal of the right to negotiate by states. Proposed 43A allows the states to propose an alternative regime to the right to negotiate on leased areas, including pastoral leases. We 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10553"> have to be concerned as to what sort of open slather use that would give the green light to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do oppose the government's proposals. We do have an alternative constructive proposal before the chamber and we look forward to moving that at a later date. I do say to the government once again that it spent the last debate arguing that we need certainty and constitutionality. Unfortunately, in terms of at least the just terms provision, if not the racist power, the government would have some problems with this particular proposal.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given the hour, I am not going to speak at great length on this section. But it is probably the most important section because the people most affected by the Wik decision are of course Australia's farmers. As we know, they operated on the assurances given to them by all that pastoral leases extinguished native title and that their leases were secure. That is what they were promised in 1993. The Wik case completely changed that by its decision by a bare majority that pastoral leases do not necessarily extinguish native title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The farmers of Australia said to us, `That is completely unacceptable.' Here we have a bare majority of the court making a decision with profound implications for 42 per cent of Australia and so many of Australia's farmers and the security of their titles and businesses in which they have invested their lives. They said to us, `You have to do what Keating promised us. He said in 1993 that our leases are secure. That is what we want. That is all we ask for. What you promised us in 1993.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect they asked us to implement the decision of the architect of Mabo, Chief Justice Brennan in the Wik decision, where, of course, Justices Brennan, McHugh and Dawson all found that pastoral leases do extinguish native title. We said after much consideration and debate that that was not a position we could adopt. We as a government could not move to extinguish native title on pastoral leases now that the High Court had found by a four&hyphen;three majority that leases did not necessarily extinguish native title, but we did say to Australia's farmers that we would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> put together a package which, while respecting the common law right to seek a determination of native title on pastoral leases, would give Australia's farmers the certainty they need to continue their businesses which have been the backbone of this country for so very long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's farmers do work hard for this country in the most extraordinarily difficult circumstances&mdash;the driest, hardest conditions in the world&mdash;and have been and are the most efficient farmers in the world. They deserve the security which this package delivers them. We believe that we have found the right balance between delivering them that certainty, but at the same time preserving the common law right to claim native title in accordance with the Wik decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we are supported by the Australian people in that. You will have seen in the recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> poll that 81 per cent of Australians say that farmers should be guaranteed that they can use their land as needed. There are recent surveys showing that the Australian people believe that the Australian farming industry is the most important industry in the country and, of course, for much of our history it has indeed been our most important industry. The Australian people recognise both the sacrifice and the contribution that farmers make to the economy, livelihood and security of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our package gives them that security; the security to get on with their businesses to generate the jobs, income and livelihoods upon which so many of us do depend, but, at the same time, on the basis of the non&hyphen;extinguishment of native title on pastoral leases and full compensation wherever native title is impaired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of people say, `But the Wik decision was that pastoralists' rights prevail, so what is the problem?' The problem is that the Native Title Act was written on the presumption that it would not apply on pastoral leases. Therefore, it took no account of the fact of the Wik decision saying that native title can survive. It was written on the presumption that it would only apply on vacant crown land and Aboriginal land, and therefore it makes no allowance whatsoever for its application 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10554"> on pastoral lease land and the interaction of pastoral lessees and native title holders. The operation of the act, because it was written in that way, is what matters, not what the High Court said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court by its Wik decision triggered the application of the Native Title Act on pastoral leases, so that everything done on a pastoral lease has to comply with the Native Title Act and it does not allow for the Wik decision to be implemented. It does not actually allow the proposition that the statutory rights of the pastoralists prevail over the common law rights of the native title holders, which is of course what the Wik decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our package gives effect to the Wik decision. It does ensure that farmers can continue to engage in primary production on their pastoral leases. It does ensure that, wherever native title rights are found to coexist, they are subject to the rights of the pastoralist. It does ensure that additional grants of primary production rights on pastoral leases cannot extinguish native title, but shall only prevail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, we are doing more than the common law position, because in common law it is quite clear from the Wik decision that governments can grant rights that extinguish native title on pastoral leases. We are saying, no, that is not the case. Additional rights can be granted, but they shall operate on the basis that effectively they suppress&mdash;or suspend, as Senator Harradine would put it&mdash;the native title; they do not extinguish it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only way in which native title can be extinguished is if there is a compulsory acquisition, as under the current act, and that acquisition can only occur in a non&hyphen;discriminatory way for genuine land management reasons where there is a change of purpose and where all the rights in relation to the relevant area of land are acquired compulsorily in a non&hyphen;discriminatory way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe it is the right package and the right balance. It is a sacrifice on the part of Australia's farmers. They do not like this. They have asked us to do much more than we are doing, but we believe we have struck the right balance and we are asking them to compromise. They are compromising in the acceptance of this and we ask the parliament 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to accept this as the right compromise that does ensure farmers can carry on their businesses with some certainty, at the same time ensuring that native title claimants and holders can pursue their common law rights and exercise them in accordance with the Wik decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the basis that we believe after much long, hard discussion and work and taking account of all the expressions of opinion put to us over many months on this issue that we have the right balance, we are not in a position to accept any of the amendments proposed by the other parties. This is a delicate balance which does strike the right chord, and we ask the parliament to support it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10555">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And mining is excluded from that. The difference in the position taken by the Australian Labor Party and the Greens-Democrats amendments supported by the National Indigenous Working Group is that there is a very narrow definition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a difficult decision, I guess, in terms of upgrades, but the definition supported by the Greens, Democrats and National Indigenous Working Group under these, I have to say, compromise amendments is to limit the level of activities to those supported by the current definition under the Northern Territory native title act. It is in their future act regime. That is actually an important mechanism. Unfortunately, I think there is too much scope in what is proposed by that of the opposition, certainly in cases like in Western Australia where substantial amounts of other activity might be considered to be acceptable without the right to negotiate. I think this is a major problem still.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that the government's position is as I have read out&mdash;basically that pastoral leases equals farms&mdash;which I think many people in Australia would think was outrageous, considering the expectation, certainly in Western Australia, that pastoral lease largely means the ability to run sheep or cattle. Whilst there are very few limitations on off&hyphen;farm activities, the Greens and Democrats amendment is opposing off-farm activities being included. The opposition amendments do allow limited off&hyphen;farm activities. So it is still leaving what could be a substantial door open for the removal of native title rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my opinion and in the opinion of many of the groups who are supporting the rights of indigenous Australians and also supporting the wider issues of what might be considered a substantial land grab, this is part of the other agenda that has come into this debate. I guess the agenda in support of the mining industry but the sweetener for the pastoral industry was the promise of upgrades and changes to pastoral activities to include what in states like Western Australia generally is not included in the definition of pastoral lease. So there still is a substantial difference in relation to upgrades between the opposition 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amendments and those of the Greens and Democrats. The wording is very similar, I have to say, but there has been a lot of careful work to find out exactly the meanings of each word and unfortunately the gap is still unacceptably wide, in my opinion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Margetts on this that there is a very considerable difference. Senator Minchin said that this was one of the most important provisions, if not the most important provision. Let us put it this way. There is a large pastoral lease which indigenous people enjoy traditional to and rights on and the cultural connection to the land on which has been a cattle lease since it was issued. In the future we can expect that many such leases will be subject to what is called upgrades. That means that the leaseholders will get permission to go ahead with development other than just cattle grazing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where are the rights of the indigenous people in this? We say that, while not having a right to a veto that is accepted, they ought to have a right to be able to negotiate about the change that is going to occur on their traditional land, the land of their attachment. But the Labor and government position is that that right to negotiate will not be given. Labor says that the indigenous people ought to be informed and consulted but, at the end of the day, that means far less than having a proper negotiating right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at such a leaseholding with the Labor amendment, or, no less, the Liberal amendment, in law. If the leaseholder wants to put half of the land involved under cropping&mdash;let us say, cotton cropping&mdash;the indigenous people have no right to negotiate on that under these amendments. If to clear the land for the cotton grazing either the leaseholder or a third party cuts down all the trees in the savanna woodlands for woodchipping&mdash;let us say, in an area like the gulf or Cape York&mdash;under the Labor amendments the indigenous people have no right of negotiation or consultation and under the government amendments they have nothing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10556">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is then a damming of a river nearby and an irrigation canal brought across to irrigate the crop, under provisions variously in here, the indigenous people have no right to negotiate. If a third party is brought in to create a large gravel extraction or soil extraction works on this leaseholding&mdash;all these things eat into the traditional enjoyment of the land by the indigenous people&mdash;the indigenous people get no right to negotiate. So you have half the region totally transformed, totally unavailable to indigenous people as they knew it. It is cutting across their access, cutting across their traditional pursuits, changing the land, transmogrifying the land, with no right to negotiate with the positions taken by either the government or the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, Senator Minchin, this is a heart matter here. Yes, this is core. You can envisage this is occurring on only one leaseholding here or another one over there or one somewhere else. I do not. I face the reality that next century is going to see huge changes to the face of the land of this country, and that change is going to be greatest across the north of the country where this question of native rights, indigenous rights, is most important. So, serially, under these provisions, we are going to see enormous changes to the traditional lands and the ability of people to maintain that time&hyphen;honoured attachment with the lands, including that spiritual attachment. It will all be taken away with no right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is manifestly wrong. That is manifestly insupportable. That is a great retreat on the rights of the indigenous Australians. It is a great derogation of those rights. It is going to cause continuing frustration to say the least to the indigenous people, the people who are out there today who do not know what the fine print of this legislation is, but we in here do. We are making a decision here as to whether we are going to cut the indigenous people of this country out of the right to negotiate on the thing that most changes the land, the broadscale changes to these massive leaseholdings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate that there is nothing in this legislation that says that the process cannot proceed, that the leaseholder cannot change 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> half of his or her land to cotton crops, cannot put a dam on the river, cannot divert the river and cannot do other things like cut trees down. Nowhere have the indigenous people the right to stop that. Surely they ought to have the right to negotiate to be able to make the outcome have a lesser impact on their interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Make no mistake about this: this is the serial erosion of their time&hyphen;honoured rights and attachment to the land, that core thing for indigenous people right around the world&mdash;the relationship with the land, the bonding with the land. This is the serial erosion of that written into the law for the future. That is why we take the position which has been taken by negotiators for the indigenous people themselves that at least there ought to be this basic right to negotiate. That is why I will not be supporting either the opposition amendment or the government in this matter.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I have said is that there are a number of effects in the legislation which are relevant to this question. Firstly, you have the notification and the advance consultation requirement. That is fairly critical because under the government's proposal there is an inadequate regime of notification and engagement with indigenous Australians. Secondly, we are concerned that it not be open slather. For instance, under our proposals, one cannot change the dominant purpose of the lease in a backdoor way. Thirdly, there is protection in respect of sacred sites.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overall effect of those three measures&mdash;together with the indirect effect of having pressure put on the states not to do so freely at will, but to show some responsibility in the process by imposing on them the actual cost of the compensation that may flow from impairment of native title&mdash;is important. We believe that, if you were to allow the states to do this without some consequent responsibility, they would just be doing it at the national government's expense. The best way to put it on the states is to ensure that, if they are going to go and embark upon some of these matters with careless disregard for native title, they should also have to pay some of the bill for it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Vaguely. It really still leaves it fairly wide open. The definition of `dominant purpose' still can mean, for instance, that there is no right to negotiate in relation to planting of some crops. In Western Australia, anybody who knows what some of the major environmental issues are on pastoral and rangelands would understand that the issue of planting crops on rangelands can be a major problem. It can actually affect species and even affect the enjoyment of native title rights because it basically means that things like buffel grass and leucaena become a major environmental issue within the area. That would certainly affect the values within the area for traditional uses and for the plants and animals in the area. I know the government would pretend that environment has nothing to do with the enjoyment of native title rights,

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first question is yes. The answer to the second question is that those sorts of activities, to the extent that they are allowable under the second tier of our third-tier approach, would have to not be formal upgrades. They would have to not change the dominant purpose. They would have to respect indigenous native title areas if, on the basis of our provisions, they need to be taken into account, as do heritage sites. The right to negotiate, as we have made clear in our proposal, will apply only in respect of formal upgrades but not in respect of that diversification which is allowed under tier two.

<PARA STYLE="Para">The point raised by Senator Margetts, the Labor Party and a number of other people as well has been giving me some concern. I will first of all describe what it does. I have moved a new subclause (f) to 24GD(1). This section applies to a future act if the future act takes place on land which has not been the subject of an approved determination of native title in respect of which the native title rights and interests include a right to exclusive possession of the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has indicated&mdash;I think it may have already done so in what we have just voted for&mdash;amending section 24GD to limit off&hyphen;farm activities to grazing and access to and taking of water. If a pastoralist wishes to undertake those activities on freehold land, the pastoralist would need the consent of the landowner. The section, as currently worded, is discriminatory if that same pastoralist would not have to obtain the consent of the native title holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Native title may encompass a broad range of rights from rights to access through to rights of exclusive possession, as was found to be the case in Mabo and in fact at Crescent Head. Where a native title is the latter kind, that is to say in the exclusive possession kind, it would be particularly discriminatory if pastoralists on adjacent or nearby properties 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10565"> could agist their cattle or sheep without the consent of the native title holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment is designed to ensure that native title holders whose native title rights are determined to include a right of exclusive possession are not subject to section 24GD. I am sure that eventually the government would understand the purpose of this. It is carefully worded to apply only to those native title holders who are not claimants for exclusive possession but are determined to have a right of exclusive possession. Under those circumstances, I think everybody would reasonably expect that those holders of that sort of title should be given the same courtesies as freehold land owners.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sheet No. 21 goes to statutory access rights on pastoral leases. The government proposes a scheme which ensures that, once a native title claim over all or part of an area covered by a non&hyphen;exclusive agricultural or 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pastoral lease is registered and one or more native title claimants regularly have physical access to the land for the purpose of carrying out traditional activities as at 23 December 1996, the bill provides a conditional statutory right of access to those areas while the claim is in progress. The rights of the leaseholder are deemed to prevail over statutory access rights. Additionally, while the statutory right of access applies to any part of the lease, no person can enforce any native title interests or rights in relation to the whole of the land covered by the lease. That is a particularly important provision that needs to be noted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The access rights apply where native title holders have not previously been excluded from entry. There is an absurdity in the provision in that it will be unnecessary for claimants who already have access to the land, but it is, in a sense, probably unhelpful for those who do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have some criticisms of the government's position. The provision has been described by the Kimberley Land Council as one of the cruelest hoaxes in the bill. The working group comments in its submissions to the parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund that the provision of a very limited benefit is likely to be difficult to enforce and precludes the exercise of common law rights of access. If it is of benefit to indigenous people at all, which they claim is doubtful, the benefit is likely to be entirely marginal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the registration test is too onerous. It demands physical access. However, throughout history, we know that many Aboriginal people were forcibly removed from their lands as part of government policy. Aboriginal people are, in some instances, denied access to their traditional lands by pastoralists. There is a lot of evidence before the parliamentary committee in respect of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern is that if the native title claimants did not enjoy or were refused regular physical access until 23 December 1996, the statutory right of access is not available to them. The question of what constitutes regular physical access is some 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10567"> thing that is not answered. We are concerned that the effect of the statutory right would be to suspend over the whole of the lease area a capacity to claim, even if one individual claimant is entitled to statutory access rights under the subdivision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern is that, if a determination of native title is made, no compensation is payable for the suspension of the native title rights in this respect. So, once again, we have the all-pervading questions of constitutionality and discrimination. We believe that the suspension of rights in this way would constitute an acquisition of property, giving rise to just terms claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a particular irony arising out of this in that, for the conditional statutory right of access to apply, there needs to be a native title claim lodged. This would be a matter concerning pastoralists. In effect, Aboriginal people who have access and have had continuing access are now being encouraged to lodge a native title application to gain a statutory right of access, which is a right they have exercised for some time. It is a provision that will ensure that a whole range of claims will be lodged in order that people can protect their current position. In lodging those claims, we will be scaring the life out of people who are coexisting quite well at the moment. So we have some amendments, and we look forward to moving them at the appropriate time.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important to remember what the Wik decision was. It was that pastoral leases in Queensland do not necessarily extinguish all native title. There was no finding that the Wik people hold native title; it was simply the removal of the previously considered block to the claim. That is, as a pastoral lease had been issued over the land, the Wik people now have to seek a determination that they have maintained their traditional connection to the land. That has to be heard through the judicial process. Some people seem to think that Wik decided that all Aboriginal people automatically have access over all pastoral leases across Australia. That is not what was decided 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the Wik case. It provided that people can seek a determination that they hold native title in respect of particular pastoral leases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come from a state where all Aboriginal people have had statutory access rights on pastoral leases virtually since the inception of the concept of pastoral leases. In South Australia we are very proud that our pastoral leases have that statutory access right provided. It is set down in the statute, it is part of the lease, and it describes those rights, who is able to exercise them and under what conditions. We are dealing with a different concept here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having made the policy decision that it would not extinguish native title on pastoral leases, in this positive policy proposition the government wanted to ensure the preservation of access being exercised as at the date of the Wik decision. We genuinely wished to respond to any move by anyone on a pastoral lease to move against those who may have been exercising access rights&mdash;whether under a statutory right, as we have, or informal access arrangements&mdash;when the Wik decision was handed down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, some pastoral lessees&mdash;and I do not know of any, but it is possible&mdash;may have reacted with fear to the decision and sought to go back to a position where no access was granted in order that any subsequent native title claim may not succeed. This was a positive move by the government to confirm and guarantee existing access arrangements as at the time of the Wik decision and to prevent that sort of removal or denial of access that had been exercised as at the date of the Wik decision. We think this is one of the positive elements of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The statutory access rights that exist in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and South Australia continue, and in many respects they are very wide access rights. There have not been access rights in some other jurisdictions as of right, but there have been casual and informal arrangements where pastoralists, by and large, have no difficulty whatsoever with Aboriginal people being on the lease. We wanted to preserve and protect that and make sure that those access rights could continue to be exercised.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10568">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to see where the government is coming from on this. From our point of view, the policy proposition involved is not something that was an automatic consequence of the Wik decision. Wik did not decide that this should be the case. We see it as a very positive element in the bill and one that makes a lot of sense. It does not impose something on pastoralists by statute, except that they are not able to deny access where it was being exercised on 23 December 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of what native title rights as such may be on the lease is a matter for the courts to determine in respect of claims. We hope that, through our agreements mechanisms, agreements can be reached without necessarily going to court over access. That would obviously be a much better approach. There has been a very significant move by the Liberal government in South Australia to put in place these sorts of comprehensive agreements over access on pastoral leases to cover things like gates, guns, driving, fires and so on so that there is effective, practical and manageable coexistence on pastoral leases. We applaud that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note why we put this in, and the way it is to operate. It is an interim statutory access right, pending the outcome of the native title claim and what rights are determined as a consequence of the native title claim; so it is a right for those Aboriginal people with access to the land who have a native title claim registered to guarantee that interim statutory access right, pending the outcome of their native title claim. Their native title claim may result in their being granted rights greater than the access rights they were exercising, or it may find that they do not have native title to the pastoral lease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been suggested that this should be made much wider than it is. That is not consistent with our policy. It is important to remember what the indigenous land fund was about. That land fund was a recognition of dispossession. That is the parliament's mechanism by which dispossession of Aboriginal people in the past has been acknowledged and recognised. It is one that we support. I remind you that, as the previous government did, we are continuing to put $120 million a year into 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that fund, so that by the year 2004 it will have a capital sum of $1.3 billion, which will enable Aboriginal people to buy $45 million worth of land every year forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a considerable sum of money, which is available every year for Aboriginal people to buy land. Indeed, I am advised that the total value of all pastoral leases on Cape York is currently around $50 million, so this land fund would enable every pastoral lease to be bought on Cape York in one year. Those who have suffered dispossession have the enormous benefit of that indigenous land fund in recognition of that and to enable Aboriginal people to buy traditional lands, whether they be under current pastoral lease, freehold or whatever. It is important to remember that in the context of this access rights provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about access on land currently leased by Australian farming families where there is access in place at the time of the Wik decision&mdash;it is important to recognise that&mdash;but we do not think it is justified to go further, particularly in the light of the policy decisions made earlier, which we support, in relation to the indigenous land fund, and in recognition of the fact that all the mechanisms are there for native title claims, which obviously would involve access rights, to be pursued, and judicial determinations made as to whether the native title has been made out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have only one amendment: amendment No. 43 relates to affirming that indigenous land use agreements can deal generally with access issues and that persons may seek the assistance of the Native Title Tribunal in negotiating such an agreement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have now returned to the sections dealing with the regulation and management of water. I would like to put some words on the record in some detail in relation to this issue because it is one of the issues which is, I know, causing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people considerable stress.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens and Democrats have proposed amendments to establish a regime for a full and proper process of consultation with indigenous Australians over the management and regulation of water. The indications are that Senator Harradine so far has not supported any of the amendments put forward by the Greens and Democrats in relation to these issues, but I would ask him to at least consider supporting, at the very least, the ALP amendment which maintains the status quo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mabo No. 2 left open a number of major legal issues, including whether traditional rights and interests regarding onshore waters and areas of sea and seabed may be recog nised as native title under common law. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10575"> present Native Title Act 1993 leaves these issues to the courts. The Croker seas and Yorta Yorta cases, which are presently before the Federal Court, are expected to clarify the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indigenous fishing rights have been recognised to both onshore and offshore waters in overseas jurisdictions including Canada, the United States and New Zealand. This has included the right to take fish for subsistence purposes and, in some cases, the right to trade or operate commercial fishing ventures. In 1905, the United States Supreme Court held that the Indian tribes were `not much less dependent upon fishing than the air they breathed'. That was the United States v. Winans 198 US 371 of 1905. Over time, this right has developed from a mere access right to a right to avoid licence fees and to include a harvest share. In Canada, the Supreme Court has expanded indigenous fishing rights beyond subsistence needs to include ceremonial use and a broader use of fish than mere day-to-day domestic consumption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recognition of these rights has enabled indigenous people to negotiate with governments and commercial interests to ensure that they are a stakeholder in the process. This is also ensuring that commercial fishing quotas do not detract from subsistence fishing, that proper mechanisms are in place to protect certain species and that pollution and overfishing are prevented. In some cases, indigenous people have negotiated a significant involvement in the fishing industry such as a share of the harvest of certain species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At common law, ownership of water as such has never been an issue. It has been regarded as a resource belonging to no-one and, therefore, accessible by anyone. The Crown has long sought to regulate and manage waters to exercise full dominion over water in rivers and lakes and to undertake generally, the conservation and distribution of water. For the attainment of that object, it was not necessary to destroy anybody's rights, but it was necessary to give to the Crown, or some statutory authority, overriding rights to which private rights must, if the need arises, give way.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments that the government proposes permit effective extinguishment of native title to onshore and offshore waters by ensuring that the grant of future commercial and other interests regarding the use of waters or water resources always take precedence. The precise mechanisms whereby this outcome is achieved are contained in schedule 1, division 3, subdivision H. The proposed government amendments remove from indigenous native title holders all authority to deal with natural resources in these areas. They confer that authority on government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no duty imposed on government to take account of the interests of native title property holders in exercising its regulation and management function, an appropriate process of consultation giving sufficient time for full consideration of all issues, particularly the effect on native title rights and interests regarding any relevant legislation which should be required. This should acknowledge the legitimate interests of native title holders as stakeholders in the process. Also, an appropriate mechanism is required to reconcile native title rights and interests and other rights and obligations. A bare statement that the latter prevailed to the extent of any inconsistency is not appropriate. Some kind of right to negotiate is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to indicate that I have taken quotes from the National Indigenous Working Group's submission to the Joint Committee on Native Title because it is vital, and has been considered to be vital, to put some of these issues on the record. They have said that any act which constitutes the management or regulation of water or airspace, again, if inconsistent with native title rights and interests, will be valid pursuant to subdivision H. There is an entitlement to compensation but no obligation to compulsorily acquire native title interests and hence no obligation to negotiate. This particular restriction is applicable to both onshore and offshore waters. Again and again, the message that is given to me is that the most important issue here is the right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to address some of the points made by Senator Minchin in this place on Tuesday, 2 December in relation to the future 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10576"> act regime applying to waters. Under the current act, any grant of new rights is subject to the threshold element of the future act regime by which native title holders must be accorded the same procedural rights as they would if they possessed ordinary title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of waters, all existing rights of the Crown and any existing fishing access rights may be confirmed by the Commonwealth, state or territory. Any grant of new rights is subject to the right to negotiate. The proposed amendments are a significant impairment of existing rights. They will enable effective extinguishment of native title in waters, and they are likely to be in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act because new grants to water or water resources will simply be valid and not attract the right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Native title holders will only be allowed the most minimal procedural requirement available to them before governments take action which may permanently deprive them of their rights to fish or use waters or to prevent desecration of sacred sites in, for example, wetlands, water holes or rivers. Senator Minchin has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the extent that there is any mining or compulsory acquisition involving water, then that would continue.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is incorrect in relation to waters. Under the proposed amendments to the future acts regime, governments can make laws to manage or regulate waters. They will also be able to grant interests, such as leases and licences, over waters. The non-extinguishment principle will apply, and compensation will be payable to native title holders for any impact on native title. But the proposed amendments will deny native title holders the right to negotiate and provide only the most minimal procedural requirement available to them before governments take action which may permanently deprive them of their rights to fish or use waters or to prevent desecration of sacred sites in, for example, wetlands, water holes and rivers. Senator Harradine has written in his explanatory memorandum the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The right to negotiate is intended to protect native title wherever it exists. As the National Indigenous Working Group rightly points out, the recognition of native title is meaningless without some mecha 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nism to protect it against arbitrary impairment or destruction.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Harradine is right. We await the outcome of the Yorta Yorta claim to determine if, in that instance, native title exists in those waters subject to the claim. The government amendments seek to remove an important protection for native title before it is known if native title has survived. They must be rejected. I urge Senator Harradine, as he was unable to support the Greens-Democrat amendment, to at least support the ALP amendment in this regard.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. We are trying to put in place here a future act regime for one of our governments' most important responsibilities&mdash;that is, the management of water on all of our behalf. It is important to remember that the statutory right to negotiate per se does only apply in relation to mining and compulsory acquisitions for third parties. That will continue under these provisions in respect of water to the extent that there is mining on water, which I am not aware of, or compulsory acquisitions, which again I am not aware of. Where those activities are proposed, then as is the case now the statutory right to negotiate would operate, but there is no statutory right to negotiate now in respect of other activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is the doubt as to whether future management rights and management activity can be validly done because the current provisions of the act only talk about existing rights and really do not set in place a regime for management into the future, except that you have the freehold test. That means it can only be done if it can be done on freehold, and that is not a relevant test in many respects in relation to these sorts of activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments are involved in huge numbers of transactions involving water in Australia. It is one of their primary responsibilities on our behalf. I do not know whether what is being contemplated is a statutory right to negotiate in relation to anything that happens on water but that is an absolutely unworkable proposition, given the thousands of licenses, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10577"> renewals, et cetera, that are issued across the country involving water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have put in place in amendment 25 a notification and regime and an opportunity to comment. We are providing that the non-extinguishment principle applies. We are not talking about extinguishing native title rights. Native title rights can be pursued in court and determined. Nothing in these provisions affects that. All it does is effectively put in place the Wik decision&mdash;that native title can, if the court so finds, exist in and on water but, as in Wik, subject to statutory rights granted by our governments in managing water on our behalf. To the extent that those statutory rights&mdash;which may well be granted to Aboriginal people&mdash;affect native title, then compensation is payable. We think this is one of the essential elements of this package to guarantee the capacity to manage water on our behalf into the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have come a long way. It was hard to envisage this morning that we would get to not quite 5 o'clock and be in a situation of getting close to a third reading and, hopefully, close to finally voting down the bill, because it is so rotten that it is insupportable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last few amendments have indicated how difficult it has been to deal with such a complex issue in the manner that we have proposed. It shows very accurately how much consultation would have been necessary to make this bill workable. We were dealing with suppositions that things would not work and, unfortunately, the very people on whom this is being perpetrated have not been part of the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, we have dealt with debates in relation to whether or not there is a system that would work for fishing permits. It seems to me that if we had sat down with the people who were hoping to claim native title rights in relation to the right to negotiate on waters, we would have been able to work out a workable system with government on things like fishing permits. It would have been possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So many topics have been brought up where people have said that the world as we know it will end, but it would have been possible to resolve them by sitting down and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> working with the people on whom this legislation is meant to be focused. It would have been possible to work through systems which would work in those areas of pastoral leases, expedited procedures, indigenous land use agreements and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been manifest in the debate we have had so far is that the minister has been telling us that such provisions are unworkable, and yet there has not been a process by which the workability has even been worked out with indigenous Australians. What we have seen is a farce. We have made some substantial changes, but most have been relatively small changes to a bill that is still manifestly unfair from the point of view of basic human rights and the enjoyment of native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minster has continued to act as if native title is something that was somehow conferred by legislation, somehow a gift that parliament can give or take away&mdash;and, of course, it is not that&mdash;somehow must be earned, somehow must be proven in a complex legal process, somehow can be struck out in any number of ways and somehow can be impaired in any number of ways by the flick of a pen. That is exactly what has been done; there have been lots of flicks of the pen in this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are dealing with something that, unfortunately, is not understood well by many people in Australia. It is not understood well because it was rushed through in undue haste. There was nothing like the process in 1993 when there was an effort to at least talk to as many people as possible. The process in 1993 still was not an acceptable process, but the 1997 legislation is appalling.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem we have got is that in our amendment No. 209 we actually amended a schedule, whereas we should have been amending the principal act. We adopted the words: `does not interfere directly with the actual functioning of the way of life of the community' through amendment No. 209. The wording of subsection 237(a) of the Native Title Act: `the act does not directly interfere with the community life' should be deleted and replaced with the words `the act does not interfere directly with the actual functioning 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10587"> of the way of life of the community who are the holders' and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, we amended the government's bill and the schedule, but we did not technically amend subsection 237(a) of the act. I will go through it again. Subsection 237(a) of the act reads:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few comments on the third reading of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . Firstly, I want to say that we have been involved in the committee stage of this legislation for 41 hours and 30 minutes. Together with the second reading debate, that means that we have spent over 55 hours and three minutes on this legislation. I am told that, in terms of the history books, the Native Title Act 1993 took 55 hours, so we are on par with that, but we are still four hours and 57 minutes behind the Communist Party dissolution legislation in the 1950s. Senator Minchin, that is the challenge for us next time round.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope this is my final speech in this debate. Before I make those concluding remarks, I would like to thank a number of people who have been of enormous assistance to me, my office and the opposition as a whole. Members of the public usually see only people like me speaking in this chamber and then only very short grabs of it. However, the very real reason why I and other members of the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens have been able to speak in such detail on these issues has been because of the tireless effort of a large number people behind the scenes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I thank those people, I would like to thank the other hundreds, if not thousands of people, who have taken time out over the last 12 months or so to make representations to us, to put their views to us and to sit in the gallery, in parliamentary committees and through hours of debate on this issue. Their interest is not just in this issue but also in the future of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to also thank my fellow senators on all sides of the House for their contributions to the debate and the way we have pursued this debate over recent weeks. On the Labor Party side, obviously, Senator Cooney and Senator Bob Collins have participated. Their contributions were valuable. Senator Margetts, Senator Woodley, Senator Brown and other Democrats, including Senator Lees, whom I congratulate on her accession to the role of leader, have played a very positive and constructive role.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10588">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin, I suppose everyone expected a bit of a bloodbath this week, but we have not provided that. I think the process has actually worked faster than most people would have expected and with less acrimony.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say a few words to Senator Harradine. From time to time in this debate I, and I am sure others, have been frustrated. We have resisted the temptation sometimes to get into competitive vote. I must say to you that I do not envy you your position. It is a hard one in any event. It is a hard one in terms of any normal run and flow of legislation in this place. From time to time, although frustrated, I for one&mdash;and I am sure the opposition in general&mdash;can say that we are very conscious of your position. We understand the difficult position that you have been put in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is unconscionable that the question of whether Australia embarks upon a race election can be so directly levelled at a group of people like us, and particularly you within that context. We have resisted the frustration to get into a direct combative disagreement. I think the major reasons for not doing that are that I think you have played a constructive role in this debate and we do recognise the pressures that you have been put under as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To all of those outside who might feel a degree of frustration, I point out that we have to recognise that, from time to time, in a process like this we are in the business of shaping, reshaping and making history and individuals have pressures on them. In your case, I think you have conducted your performance here in a way that, though I disagree with you often, I cannot disagree with. We appreciate that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank the members of the Labor Party shadow ministerial team&mdash;my colleagues Daryl Melham and, particularly, Gareth Evans. I think the shadow of former Senator Evans still haunts this place of this debate. The presence of Gareth Evans in this debate really cannot be underestimated and undervalued. He has an enormous brain and has played an enormous role. I am sure that everyone who has been involved with us appreciates the role he has played. Daryl's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> commitment and continual activity in this area is also appreciated. Other members of our shadow ministerial team include our leader, who has taken a very attentive and consistently supportive role in this debate, our leader in this place, John Faulkner, Stephen Smith and Neil O'Keefe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned earlier that there is a whole range of people who have been enormously helpful. I have to start with the National Indigenous Working Group and its staff, particularly Peter Yu, David Ross, Noel Pearson, Tracker Tilmouth, Ogla Havnen, Michael O'Donnell, Warren Snowdon, Andrew Chalk, Claire Henderson and Kyrn Steven. The ATSIC chair, Gatjil Djerrkura has played an enormously supportive and advisory role, as have ATSIC commissioners Geoff Clarke and Terry O'Shane.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who have worked in my office and Daryl Melham's office over recent months need to be acknowledged. They are Chris McGrath, Christine Evans, Nina Gerace&mdash;whose birthday it is today; we wish her the best and hope she has got away from here&mdash;Tamara Kamien, Toni Kytrokas, Carolyn Tan, Jeremy Goff, Chris Athanasiou, Angus Frith, Simeon Beckett, Lorena Di Sabato, Liz Iser, Philip Bolton, Richard Williams, Sean Brennan, Ron Castan QC, John Basten QC and Geoff Harders. I thank Simon Banks, in particular, from my office. The two trusted advisers, who have put up with us in the last week or so, Mike Megaw and James Fitzgerald. have to be acknowledged as well for the amazing amount of work they have done. In respect of all of them, thanks very much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Staff of other shadow ministers' offices and senators have to be acknowledged, especially those in John Faulkner's office. I thank Lenka Peraic, Vikki Gibson, Renee Gamble, George Thompson, Colin Campbell, Justin De Lollo, Christina Valentine and Ruth Webber. Those in Senator Chris Evans's office have also done an enormous job. I must also place on record our appreciation of the partners of Arnold Bloch Leibler, especially Mark Leibler and Dwyer Durack, for their assistance and Mr Alec Shand for his impressive and superlative legal advice.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10589">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who are often forgotten, but who have really been working slavishly are the staff of the Senate and the two parliamentary committees that have assisted us. In particularly I would like to thank Harry Evans, Rosemary Laing and Kathleen Griffiths; all of the staff in the Senate Table Office&mdash;particularly Rosa Ferranda, who has had the near impossible task of preparing running sheets of almost a thousand amendments; the staff of both parliamentary committees, especially Peter Grundy and Steve Curran; Neil Bessell from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, who has just won a promotion as the Senior Clerk Committees; Krysti Guest and Libby Bunyan; and in the Parliamentary Research Service, Jennifer Norberry and Ian Ireland. They have all done an enormous job. They are professionals who cannot be underestimated. We are forever indebted to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now get to the stage of what we do with the government's legislation. I have to say at this stage that on balance the opposition has decided to support the third reading of this bill. We do so acutely conscious of the fact that less than 30 per cent of the amendments that we have moved&mdash;when I say 30 per cent, most of the ones that have been accepted have been more consequential than otherwise&mdash;a very small proportion, have passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is, as a result of the process over the last week, much in the government's legislation that we regard as unjust, legally uncertain and likely to be unworkable in practice. If the bill passes into law in its present form, there will be inevitably, sooner rather than later, legal challenges mounted to some or other aspects of it. The validation clauses and the discriminatory overreach of section 4 are just two matters that come to mind. It may very well be that it will only take one court case accordingly for us to be back in parliament trying to make this legislation more workable. All that said, on balance we take the view that the bill as amended by this place will be sufficiently workable and sufficiently improved, if they are the criteria you want to apply, to justify the legislation proceeding into law.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have consulted closely throughout this whole debate with those whose interests are most closely affected by the legislation&mdash;pastoralists, miners as well as, particularly, indigenous Australians. We are convinced that everyone wants this issue to be resolved as quickly as possible and with as much balance and certainty as possible between the competing interests. Indigenous Australians, as represented by the National Indigenous Working Group, are most definitely unhappy and we should not walk out of this place without recognising this. They are most definitely unhappy with the balance presently struck by this legislation and the failure of opposition parties to have more of our amendments accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we understand their view to be that it is better for this bill to come into force, enabling everyone to get on with the process of advancing and reconciling rights and interests, than for the present totally unsatisfactory limbo to continue.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also find it extremely difficult to believe that the mining industry will see any virtue at all in that limbo continuing for the duration of the protracted parliamentary stand&hyphen;off that we have been threatened with, followed by a divisive election in the latter part of next year and a further round of parliamentary processes before there would be any new law on the books. I find it very hard to believe that industry will want to wait another 12 months before they get a new law. They would wait another 12 months and suffer a divisive race election in the meantime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So whatever voices the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) may think he is hearing, the truth is that, in adopting the extremely confrontationist stance that he has in recent days, he is in no way acting in the best interests of any of the stakeholders&mdash;indigenous Australians, pastoralists, miners or the wider taxpaying Australian community. A responsible Australian Prime Minister, one who is a genuine national leader, would do a number of things. Firstly, he would recognise that the bill he put before this parliament was never going to be approved in the form in which he introduced it. Just keep in mind that government amendments to this legislation, both in the House of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10590"> Representatives and here, far outweigh in number the amendments carried in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, any genuine national leader would accept the realities forced on the bill, and he would also accept the absolute unlikelihood of any more accommodating shift in the Senate's position. Thirdly, any genuine national leader would acknowledge that he has in fact retained&mdash;with the help of the Senate, with the help of Senator Harradine, if not the Democrats, the Greens and, particularly, the opposition&mdash;the substance of most of the 10 points in his 10&hyphen;point plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On our calculations, there are clear wins on seven of the 10 points and mixed wins in respect of the other three. Any genuine national leader, having recognised these three things, having recognised the divisiveness of an alternative approach in terms of this country and its standing, would take this and move on. I am sure interested stakeholders have got more out of this process, and know they have got more out of this process, than they would ever have dreamed of 12 months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the trouble with the present Australian Prime Minister is that he is neither a responsible Prime Minister nor a genuine national leader. He cannot, and never has been able to, bring himself to do the right thing, because he is a weak leader. He is bound and gagged by the National Party and the more extreme elements of his own back bench. That is something that Australia has to live with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say in respect of that back bench that we know how this Prime Minister will be judged by history. At best, if he embarks upon a race election campaign, he will be judged by history as someone who has been prepared to live off the political benefits of a race election. That is the best that history will ascribe to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I say to the other side, to the `wets' in the Liberal Party, to Senator Vanstone, Senator Hill, Senator Payne and Senator Coonan: do you also want to be judged in the same manner? Do you also want to be judged as fellow travellers with a Prime Minister who is judged in such a way? We have not heard your voices in this debate, apart from one occasion when Senator Hill gave a short 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> speech during the second reading debate. We have not heard the voices of the others. Silence is no excuse in this matter. I say to them that they have a challenge in the next few months: to save Australia from a divisive race campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that there is discussion in the Liberal Party about leadership, but what people do not know is that, over the last few weeks, there has been a coming together of the forces. The Costello ticket seems to have come together with the John Fahey ticket&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank the National Indigenous Working Group very much for all their work with us and for the many hours that we have spent together in working through this very complex issue of the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 . It is very clear that the yellow document of coexistence was the document that people were working to in trying to reach that level of consensus. This bill does not even come vaguely close.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made a promise in front of Australia, I guess, to a certain extent, in relation to the six steps to coexistence, and this bill does not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10591"> come close. I made a promise to Robert Bropho and to Mingli Wanjurri Nangala and to Clarrie Isaacs. As Robert left he said, `Walk tall and tell the truth.' The truth is that this bill is not nearly acceptable, not even close.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I give my immense thanks to my staff, and in particular to Matt Fagan, who joined my staff only a few weeks ago. He has lived, breathed and eaten the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  over the last few weeks. I was going to say that he has used all his waking hours; he is probably dreaming and nightmaring about the bill as well. He has been absolutely fantastic, and my immense thanks go to him. I also thank Gary Corr for his immense work, dedication and warped sense of humour, and I thank Alan Carter, Andrew Chalk, and all the people from the National Indigenous Working Group who have put in just so much time and effort in assisting the Greens (WA) in our response to the Native Title Amendment Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take this opportunity to thank all Parliament House staff, because I will not have another opportunity, for all the work they have done and the assistance they have given us this year but in particular in the last few weeks in relation to the Native Title Amendment Bill. I thank the clerks, the Parliamentary Library and committee staff. It has been fantastic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very sad day for Australia, I think, that this is what we have come to. Quite clearly, the Greens have been told again and again through phone calls, letters and faxes that the 10&hyphen;point plan being presented by the government is unfair, unjust and should be resisted. We have come to a marginal improvement, but it is in no way acceptable. The Greens (WA) will not be voting for the third reading and, because we believe it is such an important part of history, we will be dividing on the third reading.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia. Indeed, on behalf of the National Indigenous Working Group, the Australian Democrats have co-sponsored with the Greens their position in total. I want to thank the National Indigenous Working Group for their dedication. I recognise the tension and pressure they have been under, but they have produced magnificent support for all of us in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recognise and acknowledge three people from Aurukun who came this week and observed the debate. They are the Wik people, and they were here to see what was happening. They were amazed when they heard some of the remarks which were made about Aboriginal people and the threat that they might be to other Australians. They found it hard to believe they were hearing that because, they said, `We're Australians too.' That sometimes seems to be forgotten. They gave a human face, I think, to this word which has been repeated thousands of time this week: Wik. It describes some real people who live in Cape York.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank all the other senators in this place. I really do  not want to name anyone. Perhaps I should just mention my friend Ron Boswell. We do have some stoushes at times, but there is no&hyphen;one who is more sincere in his convictions than Ron Boswell. I just do not agree with him; that's the problem. I will not mention other senators. I recognise all those who have taken part in the debate. I do mention the senators in my own party and the support that they have given me, because I only picked this up a couple of weeks ago when something happened here which threw me into the debate. I say that in terms of the bill only, because it is a debate I have been engaged in and a commitment I have had for many years to the struggle for justice for Aboriginal and Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to particularly thank the staff in my own office: John Davey, Graham Carter from the National Indigenous  Working Group, Vivienne Wynter and Kerri Kellett. I know that later on Meg Lees will be thanking the parliament staff, so I will not do that now, but they have been a tremendous support. You hear people outside Canberra talk about bureaucrats as though they were some breed 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10592"> of non&hyphen;human animal. The kind of support we get in this place from bureaucrats is just absolutely tremendous. They are wonderful human beings. But I will leave that to Meg.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we have been under no illusion that the primary moral responsibility for this matter rests with each of us here in the Senate. The National Indigenous Working Group has left it up to individual senators as to whether or not they support the amended bill. The Democrats believe wholeheartedly that, at this historic time and despite an exhaustive committee process, justice has not been delivered to our indigenous brothers and sisters. My association with Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders has been a journey of 35 years. Today is the first stage in the next stage of the journey, as we continue to walk with them. In conclusion, I state that the Australian Democrats will be voting against the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had some 55 hours of debate on probably one of the hardest philosophical differences ever presented to this parliament. Apart from about five minutes of biff at about a quarter to one last night, the rest of the debate was carried out under the Marquess of Queensberry rules. This has been a very hard debate. At least in the Mabo debate the Aboriginal people went away happy, but in this debate, unfortunately, no-one walks away happy, no-one is a winner. So we have not come up with a satisfactory conclusion for anyone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge Senator Harradine. I would never question his morality, his ability or his integrity. I know the pressure that he has been under over the last 55 hours, and probably weeks before. If in any way I have offended him, I say, `Peace to you, brother.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Party constituency has had a hard and bitter pill to swallow. They have had to move away from a position of no native title on pastoral leases to one where there is a big compromise. I ask everyone on all sides of the debate to understand their position, too. They have lost a number of things&mdash;the sunset clause, the threshold test, the right to negotiate&mdash;and have picked up the schedule 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on the pastoral leases. Many minor amendments&mdash;some 1,000&mdash;have been moved. I do not know what the score is in respect of the amendments we supported and those we opposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate Senator Minchin, Senator Bolkus, Senator Woodley, Senator Margetts and Senator Brown. They stayed on the course all the time. My main consideration is that I want wealth for all Australians. If this bill is not addressed in some form in the near future, I believe we are going to put a wheel lock on both our mining and our pastoral industries. We have had that debate. We believe we have not come out in front, but we have salvaged something out of it. So I thank everyone very much for the way they have participated.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senator Margetts, I will be voting against the third reading of this native title legislation. It is a step further in what Mick Dodson has called the persistence of doctrines of dispossession. Its outcome is one of dispossessing indigenous people of their right to negotiate about the land. There is some confusion about this, but let me make it easy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right to negotiate has been retained with some aspects of mining at least but, when it comes to the wider issues of the face of the land to which the Aboriginal people so closely relate, the right to negotiate as enormous changes occur across this country in the coming century will be lost if this legislation is to prevail. They cannot negotiate in respect of massive changes involving agriculture, dams, canals, the cutting of native vegetation and mineral exploration camps. In the offshore region, which is so important to them, coastal indigenous people have no right to negotiate when it comes to the application of fishery developments, mining exploration, jetties, ports and other wholesale changes which are going to impact on the face of the country as they have always known it. We are going to see a continued erosion as a result of this legislation for however long it prevails and a retreat of the rights of the indigenous people to have a say in the land which is their everything.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10593">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Behind this is enormous pressure for development and economic advantage. As the United Nations Special Rapporteur on indigenous matters, Mrs Erica&hyphen;Irene Daes, has observed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is safe to say that the attitudes, doctrines and policies developed to justify the taking of lands from Indigenous peoples were and continue to be largely driven by the economic agendas of States.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For the `taking of lands', read the taking of the right to negotiate about lands. That is what is so wrong with this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That said, I also want to pay tribute to all those who have, by and large, so calmly contributed under such enormous pressure, not least to Senator Minchin, Senator Boswell and also Senator Harradine, whose lunchtime has become somewhat of a legend. I also pay tribute to Senator Woodley, to the opposition as a whole, and to Senator Bolkus, who has been trying to keep me at bay during this debate. He has done a magnificent job in presenting the opposition point of view, notwithstanding our differences of opinion. We had a much stronger concern about and defence of that right to negotiate, about which I have just spoken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to pay tribute to my colleague and friend Senator Margetts. This has been a long travail. Like Senator Harradine, we had very limited resources but hundreds of amendments and huge amounts of advice to get through&mdash;a very complicated process. I have felt extraordinarily well represented in her work, and I can only hope that the people who have a much more important stake in this have a sense of the work she has done as well. I congratulate you, Senator Margetts for the stoicism and the intelligence with which you have put the case. Of course, I extend that comment to everybody who has taken part in the debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has indeed been a marathon debate. I never expected it to go for six full days in committee. I think it even exceeds the amount of time spent on the Native Title Act when it was debated in this place. That was when I had only just arrived and was sitting over 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there, about where Senator Ray is now, watching Senator Gareth Evans hold the floor for so long. It is a bittersweet feeling, I guess, for me in that I am glad it is over, but I am extremely disappointed with the outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I join with other speakers in thanking everybody involved. I was going to thank Senator Bolkus profusely for his very moderate and reasoned approach to this debate until he said some very unpleasant things about my leader in his remarks. Nevertheless, I do appreciate his cooperation and the  way this has been managed in what I think has been a workmanlike, professional way in getting through a very big, complex and difficult piece of legislation. I say that as well to other senators with whom obviously we have had disagreement but who have expressed their views honestly, passionately and with great integrity. I must take this opportunity to thank my own staff; the Wik task force, in particular; the Senate staff who have been superb in this&mdash;I have never seen such a flow of amendments and amendments and amendments to amendments&mdash;and all the interest groups who I know have been in and around the parliament throughout this debate, consulting and advising everybody involved in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am extremely disappointed with the outcome, as I said. I have personally been working on the issue of amending the Native Title Act since we were elected in March last year, which is now some 19 months ago. It has been a long and arduous task. It is a very complex area of law involving some of the most difficult issues the nation can face in terms of Commonwealth-state responsibilities, common law, statutory law, questions of the entitlement of our indigenous peoples and their interrelationship with the rest of us in terms of our use of land. Some very emotional issues have been involved. I have not enjoyed the personal attacks made on me, nor have my family, but I know that is a function of being in politics and involved in such an emotive issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly have made many friends in the course of this long and arduous task in bringing this bill to this point, including people in Aboriginal communities throughout Australia whom I have visited and talked to in great 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10594"> depth about their attitude to this whole issue and the issues that are important to them. I am pleased to see Senator Bob Collins joining the government on this side of the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to thank Senator Harradine for his support of some of the more crucial aspects of this bill&mdash;in particular, the validation regime and the confirmation regime. But there are some critical aspects of this package which have not met with the support of the committee and which are very basic and fundamental to our approach to native title&mdash;most particularly, the registration test which, as I said, was the one area where, most particularly, Aboriginal people felt we should be doing something. I think the committee has fallen short of their expectations in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the whole issue of the statutory right to negotiate and the way that is to operate, I think the outcome of the debate there is extremely disappointing. Most particularly, the vote today to subject the Native Title Act to another piece of Commonwealth legislation&mdash;the Racial Discrimination Act&mdash;makes the Native Title Act essentially unworkable and makes anyone doing anything under the Native Title Act subject to enormous and endless litigation. That is no way to conduct the land management system of Australia, which is fundamental to the economic welfare and wellbeing of the nation. We will however be voting in favour of the bill on the third reading in this place and sending it back to the House of Representatives. It is a matter for the government in the House of Representatives to determine its position then on the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can only say with all the honesty I can muster that I do believe we put together a very fair and balanced package. It was criticised by a lot of people because it was a compromise. It did not give the farming community what they felt they had every right to believe was their right&mdash;that is, that they had what Mr Keating promised: exclusive possession on their pastoral leases. It did not give the mining industry what it wanted. It certainly did not give state and territory governments what they wanted in relation to this whole area, and it did not give ATSIC and the National Indigenous Working Group 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the outcome they desired. It was very much in the vein of seeking a compromise that involved sacrifice on the part of all the interest groups involved in this extremely difficult issue and, for that reason, it was subjected to a considerable amount of criticism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We maintain our view that this was an extremely fair package which does protect, preserve and respect the Wik and Mabo decisions and, as I said, it enables native title to be claimed on 79 per cent of Australia. May I close by just thanking everybody involved, and genuinely thanking Senator Bolkus for his cooperation in what has been a marathon debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was 23 December at five to 12.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was 23 December at five to 12, as Senator Herron reminds me. I said on that occasion that the parliament had been shamed into grappling with the issue of native title to provide justice to the Aboriginals and to recognise that this country was not terra nullius. We as a parliament were shamed into having to focus on that issue by the High Court. It is a problem we should have tackled years before, and I blame myself as much as anybody else. Had we done so, the stakeholders would have had legislative certainty rather than a situation where they are going to the courts time and time again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said on that occasion that probably we would have to revisit the Native Title Act. Because of further decisions of the courts&mdash;not the least of which is Brandy, but mainly because of Wik&mdash;three years later in December 1996, the Wik decision again confronted us with the need to act. I do not think that is very often understood by the public. Very often they wonder what we are doing in this place dealing with an issue in a much similiar manner. What we have been doing is attempting to enable persons to have their common  law rights structured into legislation. That 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10595"> means examining the decisions of the High Court and seeing whether we have it right. We may not have it right. It may well be that the court may say different things at certain times, but we have given it our best shot. That outcome, of course, is not entirely satisfactory to anybody. Did anybody around the chamber believe that it ever would be? That is the question that you have to ask yourselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, as has been indicated around the chamber, I do believe that the outcome gives the government most of its 10 points&mdash;seven of them, as Senator Bolkus has indicated, and parts of the other three. Having regard to that, I feel that the government should take a little while to consider it and then see&mdash;and I am sure that they will see&mdash;that the outcome of this lengthy consideration will be workable. All stakeholders, the native title holders, the pastoralists and the miners will be able to live with the legislation&mdash;the outcome of our deliberations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to thank a number of people. I thank my staff in particular. They have been under enormous pressure. As has been said, I have only four staff. I do thank them. I thank the thousands and thousands of people who have written and called our office on this matter. I can assure them that I am very grateful for them giving me their time and their feelings. Many of the letters were quite touching. Unfortunately, I have not been able to, and will not be able to, respond to most of them. My postage probably would not run to anywhere near covering that. The Christmas stamps certainly would not run to anywhere near covering that, but I thank them for taking the trouble to write to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to thank the staff of the parliament. The staff of the parliament have been absolutely marvellous, and the staff of the chamber have been extremely attentive. With all of the piles of paper that we have had to go through, they have expertly attended to our requests to obtain running sheets and the huge number of amendments. Those who compiled the running sheets should also get special thanks. I do thank them. Dr Rosemary Laing and her staff have been marvellous in preparing the amendments on the instructions that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I gave them, and the amendments, by and large, were absolutely spot on. I think the result was almost 100 per cent. The amendments, in one form or another, got through this chamber. I also want to thank the staff of the library and the staff of the Joint Committee on Native Title, particularly the secretary, Peter Grundy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to be political in any sense, but I do think I should say this now. I heard that some member of parliament did suggest that some of the amendments were Jesuitical. I want to say this so that nobody is under any misapprehension. Utilising the services of the secretary of the native title committee and the resources of this parliament I came to a decision two weeks ago as to what was the bottom line. I had decided that there was need for a bottom line&mdash;essential amendments which I believed the government would be able to live with and which would give a semblance and, hopefully, a high degree of justice to all stakeholders. That was done at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequently, I did in fact consult a number of people, one of the most important of whom was Father Frank Brennan. I do wish to acknowledge the assistance he gave to me. I do not wish to say that what I came up with reflected his view, but I know he is an expert in this field and of the people I consulted, a major person was Father Frank Brennan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I wish to acknowledge the legal advisers that I have been fortunate to have in the last few days in the persons of two lawyers from the New South Wales bar, John McCarthy and Jeff Kildea. They were extremely useful because they were acting on my instructions as to my amendments, but John McCarthy and Jeff Kildea were the representatives of the Aboriginal group in the Crescent Head settlement. That was the first native title claim settlement in the history of Australia since Europeans came here. Indeed, I mentioned during discussions that I had been to Namadgi National Park last Friday night and Saturday night and camped there. They said they are acting for the Ngunnawal people in their native title claim in this area.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10596">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particlularly wish to thank my colleagues in the Senate. I thank you all for the courtesy that you have shown me. I wish to thank especially Senator Minchin and Senator Bolkus and there talented advisors. It is invidious to single out people, but I would like to thank Senator Cooney, Senator Woodley, Senator Margetts, Senator Brown and, of course, Senator Boswell. I do thank you all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did apologise to the committee today. Yes, Senator Minchin did wonder what happened at lunchtime. He said that before lunch I was on the government side and after lunch I was on the opposition side with regard to the RDA. He said, `I wonder what he ate for lunch.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say to the opposition, Democrats and Greens that I listened intently right through to see whether my minimalist position should change. You understand that it did on occasion. On the issue of the RDA, you might say that I changed my mind. However, you would have noticed that on my running sheet of amendments I did have an RDA provision, so it should not have come as a surprise to anybody that I was wavering one way and the other.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;On behalf of the government, I want to acknowledge and thank a whole range of people who make the Australian Senate work and who have ensured that 1997 has been a productive year. I also want to outline briefly the achievements we have made in terms of legislation throughout the year and to thank those who have made it possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because it is so close to our minds, I firstly wish to say that the debate on the  Native Title Amendment Bill  1997 was an example of a very effective way of handling legislation. It was certainly one of the most complex, if not the most complex, pieces of legislation to come before this place in a long time. I am happy to inform senators that it has broken the record for being the longest debate on a single piece of legislation in the history of Australia, having finished about 56 hours and 10 minutes after it started. It beat the previous record, which was held by the Native Title Bill and it beat the record of consideration of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill which the Senate dealt with this time last year. I guess it is some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> record in this term of the government that in the first two years we had two of the longest debates in the history of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, we handled an enormous amount of legislation in 1997. We have sat longer than the Senate has done for many years. We sat for 83 sitting days in 1997. We only sat for 71 last year. Of course, that was an election year, so it was not unusual that the time should be a bit shorter. In 1994 we sat for 80 days, so we have sat for generally longer than we have sat before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are interested in statistics, the Senate has sat for a total of 734 hours and 36 minutes. We have sat past 11 p.m. on only 15 occasions, which will keep Senator John Herron happy. We have passed something like 227 pieces of legislation. We hope that some of them have made Australia a better place. That compares, for example, with 1996, where the Senate passed only 83 pieces of legislation. So we have done an enormous amount of work. We have handled something like 2,512 amendments in that time, and something like 1,391 of those were agreed to. If you compare those statistics with 1996, we have done more than double, and triple on some of those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than just state those sorts of bald statistics, an interesting point to note in relation to how the Senate is operating this year as compared with previous years is the number of committee reports that have been handed down in the past year. It probably will not surprise you, but this chamber has received 123 reports in the last 12 months. If you compare that with the statistics for sitting days, you will find that we have been receiving committee reports at a rate of greater than one per day. So the committee system is working at full speed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From a management of government business point of view, it is interesting to note that there has been a massive increase in the number of bills that have been referred to committees for consideration before they get into the chamber. Those who sit on the Selection of Bills Committee know that the government is concerned to ensure that legislation goes to committees and is reported back as quickly as possible. We have made 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10599"> some reforms to that process to ensure that it takes place. We want to ensure that legislation is available for the chamber to debate. If it is all locked away in committees for too long, that can create bottlenecks. It is fair to say this year that the normal bottleneck at the end of sitting periods has been diminished somewhat. That has been made possible because of the cooperation of senators on the other side of the aisle in the opposition and in the minor parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say some words of thanks to the very great number of people who make this place tick. Firstly, I thank all my colleagues, all the coalition senators and all their staff. We would not have been able to handle the amount of legislation we have if it were not for the incredible discipline that coalition senators have shown. With very few exceptions, they have refrained from speaking in second reading debates. They have had to restrict their remarks to other occasions to make contributions to the chamber. Almost without exception, ministers or parliamentary secretaries have been carrying the committee debates without interventions from other coalition senators. It is a remarkable discipline. It has ensured that we have been able to handle a lot more legislation than otherwise would have been possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I started off talking about the native title debate. One thing that struck me about it was that, through discussion and cooperation, the senators involved in that debate decided at the very beginning of the committee stage not to call divisions except on the odd occasion. That shows a lot of discipline from all senators to ensure that complicated matters were dealt with without unnecessary interruption. Look at the statistics of that debate. There were 21 packages of amendments. If there had been two or three amendments voted on for each package, you would have had 60 divisions. Each division takes something like eight or nine minutes, so we could have had something like 600 minutes, or 10 hours, of divisions. We would have still been sitting here at lunchtime on Sunday if senators had chosen to divide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We owe a vote of thanks to those senators involved in that debate. I know that people 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> held very strong views on all different sides of the debate. They could have chosen to vent their frustration and emotion by calling divisions and making themselves feel better. But we all feel better for the fact that the debate is over roughly 60 hours earlier because of that commonsense approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank my leader Robert Hill, whom I have to work with very closely, and Nigel Henham in his office, who keeps in contact regularly. I also thank other ministers of the Crown and their staff as well as departmental advisers who have to liaise with me and my office very regularly. While mentioning my office, I thank Alana Oatham, who advises me on managing government business. I could not possibly do the job without Alana, who has to liaise with all these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank all the whips, not just the government whips, who do a tremendous job. I particularly thank Paul Calvert, the government whip, Bill Heffernan, the new deputy whip, Claire Dace, Anna McPhee and Suzanne Ferguson, who all staff the government whip's office. I also pay particular thanks to Senator Chris Evans, the opposition whip, and his staff, including Ruth Webber. I thank Vicki Bourne from the Democrats and Jene Fletcher in her office. I mention the people in the offices because, even though the whips have the jobs and the titles and have to come in here, if it were not, as you know, Madam President&mdash;you were a whip yourself&mdash;for the staff in these offices, the place would not run. They have to chase down the whips, the leaders and the managers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This place runs on communication. When communications break down outside the chamber, the processes inside the chamber break down very quickly. If you are trying to change something in this chamber, you need to communicate and try to find a consensus as quickly as possible. If you leave someone out of the communications loop, usually accidentally, you create potential havoc inside the chamber. I thank all those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank, in the Greens office, Alan Carter and Ben Oquist; and, in Senator Harradine's office, Senator Harradine himself and Kathryn Millar. I thank also the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, John Faulkner, for his 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10600"> cooperation and assistance in helping to make this session manageable. I give particular thanks to the Manager of Opposition Business, Kim Carr, who has been very professional to deal with in managing this chamber's business. As Senator Faulkner knows, in managing a chamber where no party has held a majority for a long time, it takes a lot of cooperation and communication to make it work. I also thank Steven in Senator Carr's office for smoothing communications. I thank all non-government senators in all the other parties for their cooperation. We do not always agree. The non-government senators, particularly the senators on the crossbenches, do things grudgingly. However, more often than not, they are agreeable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank in the other place the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for the opportunities he has given me, and the Treasurer (Mr Costello); I serve as his parliamentary secretary, and it has been an honour to work with him. Very importantly, I thank the Leader of the House, Hon. Peter Reith, and Cate Clunies&hyphen;Ross in his office; we have to liaise very closely in ensuring that there is a flow of legislation between the two places and that that takes place effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real people who make this place tick are not so much the elected people and their staff. It really falls to the people around this chamber and around this building to make the whole place operate. Those of us who spend so many days of our lives in this place realise that. I would like to thank as many of them as I can. I am sure that I will forget or leave out people. I hope that I will not leave out too many. I thank them all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would particularly like to thank those who work closest with me and who have made the job of managing government business in my first full year in the job a delight, and much easier than I expected it would be. In particular, I thank Gail Bansemer, the parliamentary liaison officer, who stepped into the job about a year ago, taking over from Nhan Vo Van. Everyone who has dealt with Gail will know that she has done an exceptional job and has fitted into Nhan Vo Van's big shoes in terms of that job very effectively. It is one of the toughest high&hyphen;stress jobs. If that job is not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> done properly, the Senate would not operate, and the government could not possibly operate in this chamber. Gail is ably assisted by Jacquie Meacham, who has done a superb job as assistant PLO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank each and every one of the clerks and the clerks assistant. I thank Harry Evans, who continues to do an exceptional job, and Anne Lynch, who not only does a good job, but who gives me very valuable advice from time to time. This time last year, when I had only been Manager of Government Business for a couple of weeks and I was beginning to tear my hair out, worrying that the whole world would come to an end and that the sky was going to fall in because the government had not got two or three crucial bills through, Anne said to me, `Senator, you don't have to worry. It won't matter that much if these bills don't go through.' Anne, you were quite right; the world did not come to an end over Christmas. When we came back, everything was still in place. The world goes on, and the legislation continues to go through. We just hope it makes Australia a better place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank John Vander Wyk, who works very closely with me. I also thank his staff, particularly Bev Orr and Angie Lilley in the small room outside that door. They have done an outstanding job in keeping this place going. I also thank Dr Rosemary Laing, Cleaver Elliott and Peter O'Keeffe, who all fall into that same category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Table Office, I thank Richard Pye, who provides us with these bizarre statistics about how long we spend here and what we do. I also thank Rosa Ferranda for the excellent job she does in preparing running sheets&mdash;and what a job she has done in the last week. It has ben an outstanding job to keep the native title debate on the road, with virtually no glitches on the way through. With only one small exception&mdash;and it was not anyone's fault; it was just the senators trying to catch up on the policy issues they had to resolve in here&mdash;that debate ran very smoothly. It is a credit to Rosa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the Black Rod's office&mdash;Rob Alison and his staff, including Andrea Griffiths. I also thank the Hansard staff. They come in here and cover what we say for hours and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10601"> hours on end. They do a superb job. They get here before we get here and they leave long after we leave. They continue to provide an incredibly accurate and professional service. I thank everyone who works in Hansard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the Sound and Vision Office people who have to take our pictures and keep the television monitors working. I thank the committees and the committee staff. I thank all the other Parliament House staff&mdash;and I will go through them in some detail because they all play an equally important role in this place. I thank the attendants. They do an outstanding job. I thank each and every one of you for your contribution&mdash;for bringing me something like 532 gallons of water over the past 12 months, numerous pads of paper, pens and thousands of documents that I have to read out. I deeply appreciate your contribution to all of the members of the Senate and to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the catering staff who keep us all fed&mdash;usually overfed. I also thank the crew in the other operations in  this building: Lizzie, the hairdresser, whom I get to see about twice a year; the Westpac bank, that I hardly ever visit because there is no money in there for me; the Qantas people; and the people at Aussie's who keep us topped up with high levels of caffeine. They all do a great job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the Library staff who keep us informed&mdash;if that is possible. I also thank PISO, the security people, and the travel staff who have gone through enormous change this year. I would particularly like to thank, under that heading, Bruce Greentree, who is doing an absolutely outstanding job. I hope that Bruce will continue to serve the Senate for a long time to come. I also thank the Jetset people. They have had to set up here under very tough circumstances. My view is that, through a tough transition period, they are providing a very good service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also thank the gardeners who give us a fantastic environment to work in. When I am running from one wing of the building to another, I always enjoy running through the gardens and enjoying the ever&hyphen;changing vista that they provide. I thank the printing staff, who must print more stuff in any given day in this place than in any other square mile on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this earth. I also thank the maintenance people who keep this magnificent building in shape and the cleaners who struggle to clean up the grit and grime that we create.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the gym staff. I visit Lizzie's twice a year, and I have actually visited the gym twice this year as well, but I am sure they look after other the people in this building better than I look after myself. I also thank the nurses in the nurses station who help us incredibly and, most importantly, I thank the Commonwealth car drivers and all the other drivers who get us to and from this building safely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have left until last a couple of very important groups of people. I am sure I speak for all senators when I thank members of our personal staffs. I thank the staff in my electorate office in Cannington,  Natasya and Anthony; my staff in Perth, Dell; and my staff here in Canberra, Claire, Simon and Karen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important people in all our lives are those whom we are away from for hundreds of days a year&mdash;our spouses and our children. They have had to put up with an enormous amount in the last four or five weeks. We have one child here today who is a bit closer to his dad than the rest of the kids of members of parliament. I thank the spouses, boyfriends, girlfriends and partners&mdash;or whatever people want to call them in this modern age. They have to put up with life, look after kids, and look after households for days and days on end with their partners hundreds or thousands of miles away from them. Luckily, that is coming to an abrupt end shortly, and we will soon all be back with our spouses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, Senate colleagues, and all the people I have just mentioned, we all deserve a long break to recover our sanity and our health. I wish you all a very merry Christmas on behalf of the government, and we look forward to being back here in what will, hopefully, be a very happy new year in 1998.</PARA>

I do recall during last year's valedictory debate that the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, said that 1996 had been an exceptionally good year for the new government. I do not think anyone could characterise 1997 as an exceptionally good year or even a good year for the Howard government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From an opposition point of view, of course, this has been a year of very great highs, very significant achievements; but I need to also say that there have been some lows. Any opposition would exult in the procession of exits from the government front bench that we have seen this year. Any opposition would revel in this government's plummeting in the public opinion polls&mdash;in fact the lowest levels recorded by the coalition parties in well over a decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what opposition would not feel so keenly the distress which led to my former deputy leader, Nick Sherry, earlier this year attempting to take his own life? That was a personal tragedy for Nick and for all his friends and colleagues in the Labor Party. I think it was a very sobering reminder of the sorts of pressures that we bear sometimes in politics. Of all the political events in this year, that is the one that I suspect I will never forget and I know my colleagues will never forget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, too, would like to thank all those people who have been responsible for keeping the show on the road over the last 12 months. I join in the thanks that we offer on an annual basis&mdash;in fact, more regularly&mdash;to the clerks of the Senate. I especially want to thank Rosemary Laing, who looks after our needs, given her responsibilities, so ably and so professionally. I, too, would like to acknowledge the Hansard staff, who manage to meet our almost impossible demands for pinks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge the Table Office and all the staff of the Department of the Senate. I thank the committee staff, the library staff, the attendants, the transport officers, the caterers, the gardeners, the cleaners, the maintenance 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> workers&mdash;all those who help and support us here in this building. We do appreciate what they do for us. I know that is a view that is held far more widely than just the senators that sit in this chamber. As far as the opposition is concerned, all our members, senators and staff do appreciate what those that work in this building do for us all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to especially take this opportunity to place on record our special thanks and appreciation to Bill Adam from information services who retired this year and Bruce and Kearen from the Senate Transport Office who have served so magnificently for such a long time. Bruce Greentree is moving on to greener pastures. Labor senators just recently took the opportunity to show our very genuine appreciation for all that he has done for us over such a long period. We do sincerely appreciate the efforts of all those members of the parliamentary service. We do acknowledge at this time of the year most appropriately the huge contribution that they make to the efficient functioning of this place. I know that you regularly remind us of that contribution, and I think that is most appropriate, Madam President.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly want to take this opportunity to thank the members of my own team who have contributed to making this such a successful year for the opposition, such a successful year for the Australian Labor Party. I thank the leadership team of the opposition in the Senate; my deputy, Peter Cook, who filled Nick Sherry's shoes and has done so so ably; the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, Kim Carr; the whip, Chris Evans; his deputies throughout the year; and Senator Ray and his staff, who have given us such able support and given such yeoman service over the last 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge the opposition staff. They are the unsung heroes of this place. They work tremendously long hours. They work fantastically hard for the opposition. I know there are some rewards for that, particularly as they see the stocks of the opposition, the Labor Party nationally, improving. That would not happen without that contribution, without that support, without that assistance, without that commitment. That is really what 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10603"> it is about. We have a tremendously committed opposition staff on the Senate side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would particularly like to acknowledge Ruth Webber, our whip's clerk, because Ruth is leaving the Senate and is going to take on even greater responsibilities on behalf of the Labor Party in Western Australia. She has made a great contribution here. We will miss her, but we are delighted that she is able to serve in another capacity and we know that she is going to do a great job there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to sincerely thank my own staff&mdash;George, Colin, Vikki, Lenka and Renee here in Canberra and Jenny, Kris and Helen in my electorate office for what they have done. They are a tremendous team who give great support not only to me&mdash;they are also appreciated far more widely by other senators and Labor members and, of course, staff on both sides of this building. They have made an enormous contribution. I sincerely and personally appreciate what they have done. I know that they are much valued by so many from the Labor side of politics in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the Labor Senate team. The word `team' really sums up the approach that the Labor Senate caucus has to its work. That goes to the shadow ministers and shadow parliamentary secretaries and other Labor senators. It has been a magnificent performance from our reduced number of Labor senators in this place. It has made an enormous difference to the standing of the Labor Party in the community. We have had a very big task to rebuild over the past 12 months the confidence that the Australian public has in our party. It has been an enormous effort from our Labor senators. It is very much appreciated by me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing that is very important about the way that we work here is that we have such a terrific working relationship with our colleagues in the House of Representatives&mdash;particularly our leader, Kim Beazley, our deputy, Gareth Evans, the Manager of Opposition Business in the House of Representatives, Simon Crean, and the other shadow ministers and members in the House&mdash;and staff on the House of Representatives side. We have really been able to meld this operation into a very effective one. It is a very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> effective team that has some runs on the board. To all those who form part of the Labor team in this building, I certainly want to very sincerely thank you again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also acknowledge those from the other side of politics, with whom we work in this building on a day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day basis. As Senator Campbell has indicated to the Senate, it is never easy in a chamber like this when no one party has a majority. You have to have reasonable working relationships in this place. I thank all those non-Labor senators who have worked with us cooperatively in the best interests of the management of this chamber. I thank you, Madam President, those on your staff and those you work with to preside over this place. Your role is much appreciated by us all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say to our own team and to others in the building, be they members or senators or staff of members or senators or those who work so hard and are perhaps the unsung heroes of this place: on behalf of the Labor Party I hope you all have a very happy Christmas and a great new year. We in the Labor Party are certainly looking forward to 1998. We think that it will probably be the year that the Labor Party will rebuild even further. In the not too distant future, we are looking forward to being part of the next Beazley Labor government.</PARA>

I will add my thanks to the thanks already expressed by Senator Campbell and now Senator Faulkner.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a long year; particularly over the last couple of months it has begun to drag on. I am sure that all of us will be very 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10604"> pleased to get back to home base and to see something of our families again. Over these last couple of weeks it has been very stressful. I especially mention here the five senators who have taken the work of the Wik debate&mdash;my colleague Senator Woodley, who has done a magnificent job, along with Senator Margetts and Senator Harradine. Although we have obviously had differences of opinion with Senator Harradine as to where he has finally voted, giving the government the majority of its bill, I respect him enormously for the work he has done throughout this debate. I know he has worked extremely hard with quite a number of advisers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I especially congratulate the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron, and the shadow minister, Senator Bolkus, who have been here non-stop hour in and hour out. I was expecting several times either in this chamber or when I looked at the television screen to see that they had been relieved by somebody else coming in and taking over. But neither were going to give an inch. I congratulate them. They in particular deserve a well-earned rest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank my Senate colleagues for their tremendous support during my time as deputy leader, over the last few weeks in my job as acting leader, and in the last 24 hours since the ballot was announced. Thank you especially to all our staff, the individual staff of the Democrat senators, as well as the pool that work for us. It has been a very stressful six weeks for many of them. I wish them well. Some of them have decided to move on, particularly a couple of those based in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To everybody, to senators and their staff and all the staff of Parliament House, I wish you a peaceful and relaxing Christmas.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> add valedictory comments to those of the other leaders. I make these comments on behalf of the party leader, Senator Boswell, the deputy leader, Senator David Brownhill, the whip, Senator Bill O'Chee, Senator McGauran and Senator Sandy Macdonald. For my part, I bring greetings and thanks not only from the National Party but also from the Northern Territory Country Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, I would like to pay credit to you for the role that you have played this year&mdash;the very fine and outstanding leadership and figurehead role that you have played for all of us in what has been both a complex and a difficult year. I refer also to the parliamentary officers who assist you in the chairing of this important chamber and the senior staff&mdash;the clerks and their helpers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to pay tribute to the assistance of all senators having regard to the nature of parliament. It is a bit of a blood sport where controversy tests and makes the arguments to the best degree. I pay tribute to all senators for their roles&mdash;those of confusion and of assistance and cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular I draw attention to the untimely death of Senator Panizza earlier this year and the impact that had on all of us in this chamber. I refer also to the illness and incapacity of both Senator Colston and Senator Sherry. Those issues do impact on all of us; we all do feel for them and for their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pay tribute especially to all of the staff. Senator Campbell outlined their duties, their tasks and their names in fine detail. There are thousands of people who assist us in this place, both in a professional capacity and in our parliamentary roles. There are dozens upon dozens of what we would term the support teams who assist us not only with recreation but in so many other essential areas of support that we need in order to be here for the incredibly long hours and the difficult tasks that we undertake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to recognise the challenging role of our House of Representatives colleagues. They form an integral and important part of this parliament. Without the interaction, the competition and the cooperation that we have with them, the place would not be the obvious success that it is.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10605">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all represent unusual, diverse constituencies and electorates around Australia. Some of us have very large and geographically difficult areas to represent. Others, Madam President, like yourself and Senator Lundy, have very small geographic but again vitally important, significant national electorates to represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of us who represent rural, regional and remote Australia have that factor of transport built into our daily lives that affects so many other areas on which we concentrate when we are looking at the issues and responsibilities that we must address in this parliament. I acknowledge that we sometimes do bring a bias into our arguments because we represent constituencies that are so far flung.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our responsibilities in this place, we naturally focus first and foremost on legislation and its impact; secondly, on the budget and the budget processes that are so important to sustain government; and, thirdly, on public administration. Each of these three areas&mdash;legislation, budget and public administration&mdash;has quite properly been the purview of government for the last 18 months, during which there has been incredible change brought about by the actions of this parliament and the government. I pay credit to everyone, whether it is a public servant, a constituent or a parliamentarian, who has been caught up in that area of change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, I would like to extend the National Party's best wishes to all of our colleagues and work friends in so many areas. I would like to extend best wishes for the Christmas and festive season, for the period of recreation leave through January and, of course, for the preparatory month of February when we will all be challenged by the important constitutional convention that will precede our return to this place, hopefully refreshed and rechallenged, in early March.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the valedictories, I wish to make some comments of my own. I start by referring to my friendship and working relationship with Senator West as Deputy President and Chairman of Committees. I thank her for her friendship and for the way that we are able to work together, and I acknowledge the role of the temporary chairmen in the running of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At times it is difficult to realise, with the focus of the parliament being on the two chambers&mdash;that is, only 223 people&mdash;that there are many hundreds who work in this building without whom the parliament could not function. Today provides a brief occasion when we do recall the role that they play.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within the Senate there is the Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans; the Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch; and the Clerk Assistants, John Vander Wyk, Peter O'Keeffe, Cleaver Elliott and Rosemary Laing. There are the areas and staff who work with them to see that the chamber functions as it should and, in the case of Peter O'Keeffe, there is Corporate Management. It is a less obvious section of the Senate, but a very important one for senators and members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the chamber itself is concerned, we are indeed indebted to those of you who are the attendants of the chamber for the highly competent and unobtrusive way in which you look after the chamber, provide the things that are needed and know what is needed. We are indeed indebted to you for that. We are very aware of the demands that have been made upon you in recent times and the shortened hours that you have had for meal breaks and things of a like nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within the Table Office names have been mentioned, but I want to refer to Helen Hueston who is retiring next week after serving the Senate, and serving it very well, for 11 years. We thank Helen for her contribution and wish her well in retirement from this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of us work closely with the Black Rod's Office and the staff of the Black Rod's Office. We are very conscious of the facilities 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10606"> that are provided from there and the necessity for them. In speaking, Senator Ian Campbell also referred to the printing section and the professional role that they play in providing things, generally speaking, I would say, yesterday&mdash;that is, at least, when most people want them. To Bruce Greentree, in particular, who has had a very dramatic change to the area in which he has worked, our thanks, and to Darryl Novis, who is in the Transport Office at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other services, of course, within the Joint House Department. It is a very large department and it would take a very long time to refer to all of them. Most of them are in the basement, which I sometimes think is the most interesting part of the building. I want those people in the basement to know that we do know that you are there. We very much value the service you provide in maintaining this splendid building. It is a building designed to last for 200 years and it will only do so with the constant maintenance, care and attention that has to be given to it on a daily basis. There is no point in letting a building like this run down, thinking that it will be able to be refurbished. That would become almost an impossibility. It is essential for it to be kept in good order throughout. I also refer to John Lloyd and the staff of the gardens. I think the gardens this year, after nearly 10 years, have been absolutely at their best. In particular, I find my courtyard an absolute delight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have tenants in the building. Aussies has been mentioned. It is amazing, in a sense, the way that little space has become such a central part of the building. It is not always possible to predict if spaces will become important in a building, but that is. Westpac and Qantas are next to Aussies. We have tenants on the top floor of this building. The Parliamentary Press Gallery people are in and out of the building all the time. I think it is rather nice that we are able to mix with them as easily as we do. The nurses, the hairdresser, the Recreation Centre and more recently Jetset, of course, are tenants of our building. As Senator Ian Campbell said, Jetset have had a very difficult time taking over as they have done.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other departments in the building are the Department of the Parliamentary Library and Hansard and the services that go from there. We are indebted to the professional standard of research, advice and assistance from the Library and, of course, from Hansard and the Parliamentary Information  Systems Office. I think I would have to say that parliamentary information has got well ahead of me. I need a third person between me and the technology of the building to make the best use of it. Sound and Vision and the other areas have grown so much in the last few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I value the role and relationship that I have with the leaders of the parties in the chamber, the managers of business and the whips. Having been a whip, I appreciate the role that they play. Generally, they are not recognised as part of the structure of the Senate, but without the efficient operation of the whips' offices very little would occur in here in the way that we would want it to and the way it should happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thank you to the ABC for providing the sound within the chamber and taking us outside the building to others who wish to listen&mdash;and enjoy, hopefully&mdash;the proceedings of the place. You are unobtrusive back there behind the glass, but we do know you are there and value the role that you play in the operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In mentioning the whips, I of course include the Parliamentary Liaison Officer and the staff of those offices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am indebted to the staff of my own offices, both here and in my electorate, for what they provide to me and the way they keep the office running in a professional manner. They work very hard indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many people that one could mention. I wish everybody who works in the building, and my colleagues the other 75 senators, a happy Christmas for this year and best wishes for 1998. I look forward to seeing you again next year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must record, before I begin, my thanks to Senators Tierney and Lundy for allowing me to jump the queue due to my need to catch a flight. Thank you very much. I am going to speak tonight on the subject of Western Australia's old&hyphen;growth forests and the WA regional forest agreement which is due to be published shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As senators will be aware, two seriously flawed RFAs, from our point of view&mdash;although not everybody agrees with that&mdash;have already been finalised: those for East Gippsland and Tasmania. Both RFAs have been vigorously and rightly condemned by people with a genuine concern for our forests and all the values they contain. We now face the prospect of another abysmal RFA, this time for WA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to state up front that the Australian Democrats in the Senate and my state counterparts in the Western Australian Legislative Council will do their utmost to ensure that Western Australia is not landed with a shonky, deceitful regional forest agreement. We will expose all improper things going on with the Western Australian regional forest agreement whenever we can establish and identify what those things are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will also be doing everything we can to convince the Liberal Party, the Labor Party, the National Party and any other parties out there that Western Australia cannot afford and does not deserve a third-rate RFA. No political party should endorse the kind of shonky RFA that we believe WA is heading towards and still maintain any credibility within the WA community at large. As things stand, all indications are that the Western Australian Regional Forest Agreement Steering Committee, controlled as it is by the discredited WA Department of Conservation and Land Management and other special interests, is going to serve up an RFA that completely misrepresents the needs and opportunities for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> forest conservation, forest management and sustainable development in WA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Right from the outset, CALM has been absolutely determined to control essential information, to conceal the extent and impact of forest destruction and to cover up its appalling lack of knowledge about how to manage forests sustainably. In years to come, when historians look back on this period, I think they will not be kind to CALM executives and their political and commercial allies. Right from the outset, state and Commonwealth ministers have made themselves complicit in a cover&hyphen;up and in the concealment that CALM has carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clearest proof of that cover-up is the exclusion of the community, tourism interests, independent scientists and non-exploitive government agencies from the RFA steering committee. There is an unprecedented level of concern in WA over the continuing loss of WA's unique and irreplaceable old&hyphen;growth forests. It is generally accepted, even by some at the highest level of government in WA, that CALM has been a failure and that what remains of WA's old&hyphen;growth forests are of far greater value left intact than as woodchips and crude sawn timber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to ask my Commonwealth government colleagues how they expect that an RFA process so obviously under the control and direction of CALM, which has little credibility in WA, can be expected to produce an RFA that the WA community at large will accept. From the outset, there have been many deeply troubling things happening with the WA RFA. Consistent calls from the community for the process to be halted and reformed have been ignored to this date by state and Commonwealth ministers. Those ministers are aware of the massive problems and shortcomings of the WA RFA, and yet they seem to believe that the process can be left to roll on to its predetermined outcome and that the state and Commonwealth governments will be able to sign it and walk away from our forests for the next twenty years. Well, I'm telling you that that is not going to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ministers must be aware of just how flawed the WA RFA is. It is based on the consistent 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10608"> overstatement of the size and importance of the native forest based timber industry in WA, and a consistent downplaying of the options for transferring wood production from old&hyphen;growth forests to plantations and tree crops and the many benefits of doing this, including to the tourism industry. I hope that when the RFA options paper is produced, probably in early January, the full extent of the rorting of the RFA by CALM and other vested interests will be revealed. I have no doubt that this options paper will seriously misrepresent the options and benefits of removing logging from old&hyphen;growth forests and will exaggerate the degree of impact this will have, given the small but very important number of workers and communities reliant on native forest logging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt that the report will try to conceal the huge gaps in information and research that should have been available in order to establish a truly comprehensive, adequate and representative conservation reserve system. Already I am advised of grossly misleading maps being produced by CALM&mdash;maps that purport to show, for example, the extent of remaining old&hyphen;growth forest in Western Australia, yet are designed to minimise that area so as to minimise the amount of forest that needs to be protected in order to meet agreed reservation criteria. How can some ministers sit back and twiddle their thumbs while knowing that so much of the WA RFA is a fraud on the public, future generations and the forests?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My final message to my colleagues on the other side is this: it is still not too late to fix up the WA RFA process. There is enormous interest and knowledge about the forests and the alternatives to their destruction, and that knowledge, which exists in the community, is not being heard in the current process. If you do fix up the WA RFA, it has the potential to be one which does credit to the concept of regional forest agreements. We agree with the concept; we do not agree with the practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could put in place a process that genuinely resolves conflict and produces real, durable win&hyphen;win outcomes: for the forests, the community and the industry. I urge you to take the necessary steps to bring this about. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Any short&hyphen;term flak you may attract from a small but powerful section of the community and a few small but powerful corporate and political interests will be vastly outweighed by the overall community and business support for your intervention, and by the support that the tourism industry will give to such action. So I make one final plea to you to please make the WA RFA work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, Madam President, I have come to be immensely fond of a great number of people here. I am not going to name them, because I have got only a few minutes, but I do want to wish you all a very merry Christmas and thank you for all you have done this past year.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="10608"><TITLE>Teachers</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate tonight to unmask misinformation about the current health of the teaching profession. ALP senators, especially Senator Kim Carr, have made some outlandish statements recently about the status of teachers, especially in the state of Victoria. Senator Carr, in the three or four years he has been here, has conducted a non&hyphen;stop vendetta against the Liberal Victorian government, particularly on its role in education. He has gone on with a lot of nonsense in the last few years about the actual state of education in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">School Management Report</EMPHASIS> of the Office of Review in the Department of Education in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence in this report relates to a number of surveys that were conducted in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10609"> years 1994, 1995 and 1996. The report presents some very impressive evidence. The survey instruments are highly reliable as measures of teacher sentiment in Victoria. Before I came into this place I dealt with instruments very similar to these in my previous profession as a teacher educator and I am very impressed with the results from this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sample is very respectable, being one&hyphen;third of the profession in Victoria, and the findings from this survey are very impressive. What they show is consistent improvement across primary and secondary schools, across the years 1994 to 1996 and across all the dimensions that were surveyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is embarrassing news for Senator Carr, and he did try to prevent the incorporation of the results of this survey into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record of the status of teaching inquiry. We eventually managed to achieve the incorporation of the entire document, so these survey findings I am referring to at the moment are there for everyone to read.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the particular dimensions that were measured, in terms of changes in outcomes in that school, particularly as they relate to the status of teachers, we find consistent improvement on all dimensions. The first measure was of the quality of work life. Over the three years from 1994 to 1996 this went from 2.87 to 3.10 on a scale from zero to five. Moving towards five shows an improvement. Morale went from 3.07 to 3.31. Leadership increased from 3.38 to 3.65 and goal congruency improved from 3.56 to 3.79.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On all the evidence in this report, there is considerable improvement on all the dimensions measured. The measures on the graphs provided, which have been incorporated in the report, prove this. On the five&hyphen;point scale used, the shift in attitude improvement is all in a positive direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very encouraged by the evidence presented in the management report. It is positive. It shows that in the state of Victoria there is growing self&hyphen;esteem in the profession. The position is very healthy in Victoria. It is a very far cry from what Senator Kim Carr has portrayed in this place in a very negative and carping way. He has presented a view of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> schools in Victoria that does not line up with the evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Carr has spoken increasingly about inputs, but the important measure in education, as I said at the start of this speech, is in outputs. Any improvement in relation to the way that teachers feel about their work and what is happening in their school, along the dimensions measured, is to be welcomed. That is what is happening in Victoria. This is based on scientific data and not just on broad, sweeping allegations. This does put the lie to much of what Senator Carr has said about the state of education in Victoria in this place over the last three years.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="10609"><TITLE>Cooperative Research Centres</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today in the adjournment debate, I would like to address an issue of vital importance to research, development and commercialisation in Australia. This country has an impressive and unique history of invention and innovation in the pursuit of knowledge. All these characteristics and a recognition of the potential for further research in Australia have been harnessed by the cooperative research centre, CRC, programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These CRCs were designed and implemented by the previous Labor government, but the coalition's stance on CRCs must be brought to this chamber's attention, because this government is, once again, making a series of disastrous decisions, this time with respect to research development and commercialisation opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The structure of CRCs was influenced by models of collaborative research centres in other industrialised countries. However&mdash;characteristically of Australia, some would say&mdash;we developed a fluid and flexible model that does not copy other countries' efforts. Instead the Australian CRCs actively involve input from all over the country, from universities, the public sector and industry research bodies, as well as the private sector. Currently, there are 66 centres being supported under the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the nature and scope of these programs there is not really a typical CRC, but 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10610"> the collaborative nature of the program has resulted in commentators discussing the CRC effect, described by one author as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the intense activity associated with preparing proposals for CRCs (that) brought many people together for the first time in structured serious discussions about common interests, sharing of facilities, technological transfer and educational possibilities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One of the primary aims is to capture the benefits of research applicable to Australian industry. The model proposed by the Labor government encapsulated the need to encourage institutions to cooperate and coordinate research efforts and to stimulate education and training, particularly in graduate programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party also realised that there would be problems in this approach to collective research efforts and, accordingly, implemented evaluation processes during the seven&hyphen;year life of CRC programs. One such evaluation of CRCs was included by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training in its 1994 report of the inquiry into the organisation and funding of research in higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The positives reflected a primary aim of the government that, by design, CRCs brought together researchers with common interests in science and technology. Industry representatives reported that research links with universities were more stable in the CRC arrangement and that they had been useful in overcoming institutional rivalries. There was also acknowledgment of initial problems and some constructive criticism. The report recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CRC funding levels should be maintained to allow their consolidation. Attention should now be paid to complimenting the initiative with one-to-one project support such as GRID and ARC Collaborative Grants programs to enhance network development around the CRC areas of concentration.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The 1995 review of CRCs by an independent panel puts this history into perspective. The CRC Program Evaluation Steering Committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Changing research culture: Australia</EMPHASIS>  concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the program is well conceived and the proposals of the Government's broad objectives for the scheme being achieved are excellent. Indeed there is already evidence of a significant and beneficial 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> change in research culture&mdash;especially insofar as it concerns universities and their cooperation with government research agencies and industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The CRC review also highlighted the success of the program in developing important international links and networks as globalisation continues to affect all countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to draw the attention of all those opposite&mdash;who have continued to offer platitudes to the Australian community about the way ahead&mdash;to the Mercer review of CRCs and ask them to take the time to read it. This review highlights the fact that the program has continued to deliver outstanding success and is now beginning to pay big dividends. Success such as productivity and quality improvements in the filed welding of high strength, thin walled natural gas transmission pipelines from the CRC for Materials Welding and Joining, resulting in a $113 million saving in pipeline construction and operational costs after only one year; or the CRC for Alloy and Solidification Technology who developed technology for continuous casting of magnesium bar and ingot that is expected to make Australian magnesium the product of first choice. This means a realistic expectation of increased investment in smelter expansion, jobs and export earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the financial benefits, there is a feeling amongst those involved in CRC projects that the Australian model has responded well to this country's various industry expectations. There have been important agricultural, manufacturing, technological and human biological advances. Perhaps the most telling statistic to come out of the recent Mercer review of CRCs was that around 75 per cent of the CRCs surveyed indicated that the commercial breakthroughs and economic benefits gained to date would not have occurred unless the CRC program existed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Craig Lawn, a partner with Price Waterhouse, provided an overview of the financial benefits of the achievements of CRCs, noting the significant and tangible financial benefits that have already arisen out of the formulation and continuing support of them. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CRCs represent a critical linkage mechanism between business and public based R&amp;D . . . There is a clear desire for stable, pervasive Government policy in this area 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10611">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The survey by the CRC Association that makes up part of the submission to the DIST-Department of Finance interdepartmental committee represents, according to Craig Lawn, `an important input in the current policy debate'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> After reading the Mercer report in 1996, the previous Minister for Science and Technology, Mr McGauran, said, `The Government's strong commitment to maintaining the CRC program is based on evidence of its significant success.' This was exposed as highly hypocritical because, one month after this statement, this Treasurer (Mr Costello) cut spending on CRCs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we examine the budget figures, this evidence is an absolute reality under the Howard government. Previously, Labor had consecutively increased funding to the CRC program but, in John Howard's first budget, the increase in funding was reduced to about 15 per cent of previous increases&mdash;to a level of $4.3 million. In the following year's budget, $10 million was ripped out of the CRC program. The Treasurer also announced that they would be undertaking an exercise in looking at increased self-funding, which can be interpreted as nothing more than a thinly disguised code for more cuts. We have already seen these cuts affect the postgraduate programs in the first instance. They have threatened the viability of many centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Overlay this issue with the fact that higher education funding has suffered a $1 billion cut over the life of this government, and the cuts to the R&amp;D support for industry are all indicators of the shallowness of this government in actively underpinning the sort of research and development that is required to provide confidence for business and jobs growth in this country. It is not like we have </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para">not had a plethora of reports from industry and other bodies to spell it out for the government. Despite what is acknowledged as a fundamental flaw in the Mortimer report about their rejection of CRCs as a research model, it is good to note that the Goldsworthy report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in view of the strategic importance of the information industries in the Australian economy, and of information communication technologies for the productivity and competitiveness of enterprises across the economy, the information industries are not being given their due attention. Government support for R&amp;D relating to information and communication technologies development and applications should be at least equivalent to that available.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That important emphasis on where the CRC programs should be developed must be adhered to by this government if they are to demonstrate any genuine commitment to research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government must understand that CRCs will disappear if they are not supported by a government that must look towards a long-term approach to policy considerations such as this. The area of research, development and commercialisation is something that must underpin any sound industry development policy and proposals. As Socrates once said, `Knowledge without application is dust.' In Australia, the CRCs provide a unique environment to turn knowledge into a practical source of jobs and therefore a sounder future for all Australians.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="7.21 p.m." PAGE="10611"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 7.21 p.m. till Monday, 2 March 1998 at 12.30 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) The budget allocation for development food aid to the World Food Program (WFP) in 1996&hyphen;97 was $53.98 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The budget allocation for development food aid to WFP for each of the previous ten years is attached at Table 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) In the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) purchased 184,954 metric tonnes of food aid in Australia for shipment to developing countries. This comprised 147,645 tonnes of wheat, 22,309 tonnes of wheat flour and 15,000 tonnes of rice. It is anticipated that AusAID will purchase in the vicinity of 180,000 metric tonnes of food aid in Australia in financial year 1997&hyphen;98 for shipment to developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The annual quantities of food aid purchased by AusAID for the financial years 1986&hyphen;87 to 1995&hyphen;96 inclusive are attached as Table 2.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (a) and (b) In 1996&hyphen;97, Sri Lanka (6,064 tonnes), Mozambique (19,450 tonnes) and Bangladesh (50,000 tonnes) were targeted as recipients of Australian bilateral food aid. In the case of development food aid provided through WFP, the Government has directed fifty percent of our contribution to WFP be targeted as food aid to China (34,300 tonnes) and Bangladesh (39,700 tonnes) in 1997&hyphen;98. Relief food aid is provided in response to a number of factors. These would include an analysis of the needs of those affected, the appropriateness of food aid as a response, the scale and nature of the emergency and Australia's capacity to assist. There is therefore some variability in respect of the countries to which Australia provides relief and emergency food aid depending on these factors. The countries to which Australia provided relief and emergency food aid in 1996&hyphen;97 are attached as Table 3.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Details on the amount of food aid provided by Australia to developing countries, as detailed in the response to (3) above, over the past ten years is attached as Table 4.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) No Australian NGOs were directly engaged by AusAID to deliver food aid in the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year as all food aid was provided either bilaterally or through the World Food Program. In the 1997&hyphen;98 financial year, most of Australia's food aid will again be provided either on a bilateral basis or through WFP. WFP frequently contracts NGO's, including Australian NGO's or their international partners, to distribute food aid in its projects. Following the recommendations of a recent AusAID review of food aid, Australian NGO's will be invited to submit proposals for the provision of any emergency food aid in 1997&hyphen;98.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Shifting production of emission intensive industries to Australia, such as steel production, will not result in a reduction of Australia' s greenhouse gas emissions. To the contrary, it will cause Australia's greenhouse gas emissions to rise. This highlights one of the difficulties Australia faces in the current climate change negotiations that, under the Climate Change Convention, accounting for emissions is production-based rather than consumption-based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All other things being equal the global environment would benefit from reduced total greenhouse gas emissions of a shift from coal-based production 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10635"> in Japan to natural gas production in Australia. However, one weakness of the current production-based approach under the Framework Convention on Climate Change to establishing emission targets is that it cannot sensibly deal with such national circumstances. The approach Australia has been advocating in the Berlin Mandate negotiations, of taking national circumstances into account in establishing fair and realistic targets, addresses this.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator Parer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Minister has been advised by AQIS that postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) is a newly recognised condition causing wasting and death in recently weaned pigs (6&mdash;14 weeks of age) in the prairie provinces of Canada. No specific agent has been determined to be the cause although a circovirus which has been associated with the disease is thought to play a role in its causation. A similar condition has also been reported from some areas in the United States, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10640"> France and Spain. It is not correct, as asserted by Senator Woodley, that PMWS is rapidly spreading throughout Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) For a number of reasons imported pork is not considered to pose a risk of introducing PMWS:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> PMWS is a disease of young pigs post-weaning. It has not been reported in slaughter age pigs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is no evidence that PMWS is transmissible via pig meat.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Pigs from which meat is derived for export to Australia have to pass antemortem and post-mortem inspection under official veterinary supervision ie be free from clinical signs of disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) For the reasons outlined in answer to part (2) of Senator Woodley's question, above, imports of pig meat are not considered to represent a risk from the introduction of PMWS and no precautions, additional to those already in place in the quarantine requirements, are considered necessary in relation to PMWS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Quarantine restrictions on the handling and treatment of the imported pig meat, including wastes and scraps, are designed to prevent access to the material by pigs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, each State/Territory has legislation which prohibits the feeding of food refuse containing meat to pigs unless it has been adequately treated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each State/Territory has legislation, which is nationally consistent, for the control and eradication of exotic animal diseases. This legislation has provisions to prevent the spread of disease between herds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The Government's general preparedness policy is to provide a rapid response to exotic animal disease incursion incidents, with the preferred aim </PARA>
