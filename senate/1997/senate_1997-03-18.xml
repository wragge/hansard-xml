Is it not true that on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS>  program last Wednesday night you referred to this measure as a tax? Isn't it a fact that in the course of the Prime Minister's abuse of the superannuation industry last week he said, `Let's call a spade a spade'? Why, on other occasions since then, are you continuing to defy the Prime Minister's advice to call a spade a spade?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, my question is also directed to the Assistant Treasurer. I refer to recent business surveys which show increased confidence and an improved economic outlook for Australia in 1997. Will the minister outline the basis for this improvement in business confidence? Do Australians have good reason to expect that economic growth will strengthen during 1997?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1636" SPEAKER="Kemp, Sen Rod" NAMEID="WW4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Assistant Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam President, and thank you Senator Chapman, for this question which shows once again that the coalition government focuses on the main game. The Labor Party relentlessly gets diverted from issues, refuses to get into heavy policy issues&mdash;even Senator Sherry! So I welcome the question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is, Madam President, that the government is pleased that recent business surveys suggest renewed confidence about economic conditions. For example, the ACCI&hyphen;Westpac survey of industrial trends reported a surge in business confidence in the March quarter. The number of respondents expecting worse conditions halved to just nine per cent, with those expecting improvement rising from 30 to 35 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, the survey reported business confidence to be at its highest level since December 1994, which of course is just after Labor put up interest rates. Do you remember that? Interest rates went up three times in six months. That is what Labor did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, a major survey conducted by the Australian Institute of Company Directors and KPMG shows that 70 per cent of company directors think that growth will pick up over the next year, and 50 per cent of com 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> panies with revenue above $1 billion anticipate sales above budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This comes on top of a rise in company profits before tax of 17 per cent in the December quarter. But the good news does  not end there. The bulk of economic indicators released for this quarter suggest stronger growth over the rest of the year. For these reasons, both the government and private forecasters expect growth to strengthen over 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The good news continues. ANZ job advertisements were up 1.8 per cent in February, the third increase in four months. Retail trade was up 2.7 per cent in January. Business investment rose 0.6 per cent in the December quarter to be 20 per cent higher than in December 1995. In housing, private approvals rose 7.6 per cent in January, adding to evidence that the housing sector is in recovery after the long slump under Labor. Motor vehicle registrations were up 2.9 per cent in January. On the interest rates front, variable home loan rates are at their lowest levels since the 1960s. There have been three cuts in official interest rates, and lower business rates including small business rates. These cuts will continue to flow through to stronger growth in the coming months. Inflation is at low levels with the CPI rising just two per cent in the December quarter and 1.5 per cent in the year to December.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, we have good indicators for the March quarter, we have very low inflation, strengthening business confidence, some of the lowest interest rates in three decades and good prospects that the world economy will remain supportive of the Australian economy. All these factors give confidence that growth will pick up over the remainder of the year. That is good news for workers; bad news for the Labor Party; good news for small business and good news for families. We welcome the spate of indicators which are now coming in and which add to confidence in the Australian economy.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

You have been very supportive of that and, of course, a bill which allowed superannuation funds to collect tax file numbers has gone through this parliament, and since 16 February superannuation funds have been collecting them. That is roughly four weeks, and we know that the superannuation funds are keen to pursue this with great vigour. It is our hope that the vast proportion of Australians will respond to this request, not only, of course, for the reasons which you well know, but also because it will certainly help the administration of the superannuation industry.

<ANSWER PAGE="1637" SPEAKER="Herron, Sen John" NAMEID="VW4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Knowles for the question. I am delighted that Labor has finally seen the light. It is a pity that it has taken so long and cost so much. I am thankful for Mr Beazley's statement because I intend to move a notice to restore the bill in the Senate this afternoon and recommit the bill later this week. The Hindmarsh Island Bridge saga highlights what a second&hyphen;rate government the Labor Party was and what a third&hyphen;rate opposition they now are. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1638"> You will recall that taxpayers' money was wasted by Labor on this issue&mdash;and it could have paid for the construction of the bridge. It also happens to be ATSIC money that could have been spent on essentials like health, housing and infrastructure. The taxpayers will not forget it, nor will they forgive the Labor Party for its incompetent handling of this matter. They will not forget the four inquiries that have been held and the $4 million plus that has been wasted. They will not forget Labor's blind obstruction on this bill earlier this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was also interesting was the timing of the announcement of Mr Beazley. It was significant that he let it slip out on a Friday night, on the eve of a major national sporting event&mdash;the Grand Prix, you will recall&mdash;when he hoped media and public attention would be diverted. He actually refused to go on television that night. He refused to go. It also happened to be six days before the application to the Federal Court seeking to force me to appoint another section 10 reporter. Mr Beazley could not afford that because he had already insisted, and was still insisting, that there was no need for another inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell you that my legal advice was rock solid. The Commonwealth would almost certainly have lost the case and been forced to appoint another reporter. Labor knew that they had a choice: either do a backflip and support the legislation or wait for the Federal Court to find that they were completely wrong on the need for an inquiry and then support the legislation. Mr Beazley took the easiest option, but by doing so, of course, he left his shadow minister, Mr Melham, and Senator Bolkus over there and Senator Collins, out on a limb and then cut it off. He cut it off because they were the ones who were arguing in here for the necessity for us to go ahead.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bolkus's legal advice was not worth the paper it was written on and he is still continuing this saga. They were the ones who strongly opposed this legislation, who put up nonsensical arguments and said that they would never support the legislation as proposed by the government. I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cannot really blame Mr Beazley; after all they were the ones on that side who misled him on the issue. They sold him the dump by convincing him that there was no need for another reporter. Then, when the matter looked like going to court, they had to admit their deception. Mr Beazley has cut them adrift in a leaking boat. How Daryl Melham can continue as shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is beyond me. His leader is no longer listening to him. He no longer trusts him and has cut him adrift, and Senator Bolkus and Senator Collins are adrift in the same boat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have is a highly confused opposition. In government they opposed the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. Then, last year, they supported it, but would not support legislation to allow it to proceed. Now they say they will support the legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Patterson for that question because it is a very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> important one in the current context. Australian industry is strongly supporting the coalition's greenhouse challenge program to voluntarily reduce their emissions. The number of companies committed to developing cooperative agreements is increasing. We now have passed the 100 mark of companies and industry associations committed to the program through agreements and letters of intent. They cover a wide range of industries reflecting the breadth of industry support for the program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government was committed to accelerating the implementation of the greenhouse challenge program when it came to office. The fact is that we now have over 100 companies and industry associations supporting this program. That, within less than a year since coming to office, is testament to the government's achievement of cooperation with industry not only in this area but in so many others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The number of companies that have developed cooperative agreements is also increasing. Two signing ceremonies were held last year with my colleague Senator Hill and Minister Moore with 17 companies and five industry associations signing cooperative agreements with the government. The agreements signed to date demonstrate that companies can deliver significant emission savings. The agreements cover over 250 major sites across Australia. These sites contribute 46 per cent of Australia's emissions from the industrial sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agreements have identified over 420 actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These actions are estimated to reduce the aggregated emissions of the 17 companies by approximately 15 per cent for the year 2000. More companies are getting their agreements ready for acceptance by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two signing ceremonies have been scheduled for the next two months. A signing ceremony focusing on the electricity sector will be held next week at Parliament House. This will be followed by another signing ceremony in Brisbane on 1 May, which will focus on the expansion of the program and the innovative actions and R&amp;D identified by some companies to reduce greenhouse gas 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1647"> emissions. More agreements are expected to be ready in the second half of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will be ensuring that the momentum for this program continues. The Greenhouse Challenge Office will continue to work closely with industry associations to promote the program. The office will also continue to provide a range of assistance to companies developing agreements. This includes workbooks on how to develop cooperative agreements, workshops to provide hands-on guidance and case studies of what has been implemented by other companies to reduce energy use and greenhouse emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cooperative agreements are not static documents, and those that sign agreements will be reporting to the challenge office in implementing their actions. The program captures the capacity of industry to reduce its emissions to minimum levels consistent with their growth and competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefit of greenhouse challenge is not just greenhouse oriented. It has meant that companies and organisations have been able&mdash;by saving energy&mdash;to significantly reduce their input costs, thus making our industries more competitive, which in turn will lead to more jobs in the community.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

They say it is a tax. Senator Kemp on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> last week said it is a tax.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This afternoon Senator Kemp came under what I suppose you would have to say was sustained attack from the opposition. Those up in the gallery who have any knowledge of superannuation would know that Senator Sherry asked all the wrong questions. It was not very difficult for Senator Kemp to deflect the questions very adequately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that the emphasis of Senator Sherry's questioning was on the tax file number arrangements and the liability for tax of a number of people if they do not lodge their tax file numbers. But what Senator Sherry did not tell people&mdash;and I think this is important&mdash;is that when people become aware of that situation, or at any time, they can apply and get a refund of the tax they have paid. We all know that tax file numbers have been pretty essential for a long time in terms of both taxation and superannuation. There has been some concern by major players about the extension of tax file number scenarios. For this reason a Privacy Commission was appointed and before any legislation of importance in relation to tax file number applications is put there has to be a consultation with the Privacy Commissioner. That has all happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go back a little in terms of history and look at the tax file number. I recall that about a decade ago I was privileged to serve on the public accounts committee when it was looking at major reconstruction of the Taxation Office and a concept of putting in a major computerisation network which turned out to be worth something like a billion dollars. But what was really needed at that time and which the public accounts committee drew attention to&mdash;and which your party picked up&mdash;was the need for a more adequate system and for centralisation to be able to cross&hyphen;match.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a lot of evidence that the tax office was having a great deal of difficulty in terms of its cross&hyphen;matching. So we had the scenario that associated with this big investment there had to be some sort of cross&hyphen;matching mechanism. A tax file numbering 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> arrangement was the best way out. I must admit that over the years, particularly in the initial years, it was somewhat embarrassing to me because the debate got a little off&hyphen;line and went into the Australia card. But it is interesting that with our tax file number system we have something that is perhaps a little more intrusive than we would have had under the Australia card proposal. We all know that these have been contentious issues but at all times the Privacy Commissioner has had a great deal of say in relation to what has happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say something about the timing and the choice of attack this afternoon. Why this afternoon? Why has it taken Senator Sherry so long to suddenly discover all these issues? The legislation is now in the parliament and generally there is a convention, particularly when issues that parliamentary committees are looking at have been introduced into the parliament, that we each have our say at those committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate select committee that I chair, of which Senator Sherry is a member, only last week took evidence from a selection of about 70 people and organisations who put in some very useful submissions to the committee. The committee is currently in the process of preparing the report, which has been prepared under great time pressures.

What I really want to take issue with Senator Kemp over is his continued assertion that no middle and low income earners have to pay this tax. This is grossly misleading the Australian public and grossly misleading this chamber. Every piece of evidence given to the Senate select committee shows that there is going to be thousands and thousands of Australians who earn less than $70,000 affected.

That has been costed at between $25 million and $30 million every year hereafter. That works out at an extra $3.75. So when you stand up and say that nobody who earns less than $75,000 is going to be affected, what about the $12 and the $3? Is that no effect?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we come to the question of supplying the tax file numbers. Even your own tax office officials sat in front of the committee and said that after the mail&hyphen;outs that you are going to organise, which you committed to, and the efforts that they are going to make, they think they will have done okay if they have 40 per cent of the tax file numbers. That means 60 per cent of people who have the fund account are going to be affected. Well over one million ordinary Australians who earn less than $75,000 are going to be up for your surcharge tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) just said that we are so gutless that we have not stood up and said where we stand on this tax. He comes from a party that would not tell the electors before the last election where they stood on any policy issues whatsoever and tried to gull Australia into believing that they supported everything they stood for. One of the things that they tried to gull Australia into believing&mdash;and, in fact, may well have succeeded&mdash;is that there would be no new taxes or no increase in existing taxes. What we now have quite clearly on the record is that that was meant only to win votes; it was not meant to be delivered in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Feeble is the only way you can describe the performance of the Assistant Treasurer today&mdash;not just today but every day he stands in this place and has to answer a question. He 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1652"> does not know the answers to basic questions on his portfolio. Rather than say that and sit down, or rather than take the time that he should to find his brief and answer at least from what the public servants have written for him, he blusters, he waffles, he tells tales and he diverts the debate away from him to other things that are not relevant. This does not go unnoticed. The gallery knows that this is an incompetent person in the position of Assistant Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be particularly galling to Senators Watson and Short, who sit behind him and who have had some experience in this area, to recognise that, despite the fact that they are not on the front bench, the person who shoulders the responsibility for the government in this area is inferior to the task. I had a lot to say about Senator Short when he was the minister but, by God, come back Shorty, in the face of this performance, because he would be able to deal with some of the technical elements that Senator Kemp cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were eight questions asked of Senator Kemp today about this iniquitous tax, which it really is and which Senator Kemp admitted to it being on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program the other day. But, of course, he corrected himself in a piece of crisis management engineered by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to save the government's face. The inescapable truth of this so-called surcharge is that it is a tax. Everyone knows that it is a tax. The government will not admit it because, if it does, it will admit to breaking a core promise. As a consequence, honest Australians, middle and low income earners, will shoulder a much higher cost in paying this tax just to save the government's face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What were the questions? The first question was obviously about the tax, or the surcharge. Then we wanted to know about the tax file numbers and how the government calculated the target number that it would collect. We wanted to know why would a million middle income earners have to pay out the super taxation that the government has proposed. What answer did we get to that second question? We got a story about how difficult it might be for the Labor Party to sign up new members&mdash;nothing to do with the so-called 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> battlers, nothing to do with the question posed and nothing to do with the very serious question of how it was calculated that a million middle income earners would be hurt by this super taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We asked for a definition of assessable income. What did we get? We got an around the trees, around the bushes diatribe which dodged that question&mdash;an essential question to this whole debate. We asked about assessable income, including redundancy pay. The minister was asked explicitly to confirm what he was trying to allege in this place&mdash;that low and middle income earners would not have their redundancies taxed. Did he do it? No, he did not. What does failing to do that signify in this debate? It signifies a cover&hyphen;up and gives credibility to the assertion, which is, in fact, the truth of the matter, that middle and low income workers who are in redundant positions will have, or are at risk of having, part of their superannuation taxed in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was asked about the switching from superannuation to other forms of investment, by those who can afford it, in order to escape paying tax. Most blue&hyphen; and white&hyphen;collar workers in Australia do not have the discretionary income to pursue other forms of investment to avoid this tax. High income earners have that discretionary income.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook was a member of a government that promised not to increase the overall tax burden and promised to honour the l-a-w, law, tax pledge in the 1993 election. That government committed itself to a total of $14 billion in actual tax cuts. What did we find in the 1993&hyphen;94 budget and subsequent budgets? We found that Australians were subject to $13.4 billion in new taxes&mdash;in other words, a difference of $28 billion from what had been proposed and promised by Labor. Let me hear nothing from the other side of politics about taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, if you look at what happened to the whole superannuation system under Labor, you will find that it was those decisions, particularly the introduction in the late 1980s of the contributions tax as a deliberate means to pull forward revenue, that caused the problems in the superannuation industry that we are all trying to grapple with today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry does not seem to have advanced his cause or his thinking in this area since the budget. All we heard today was a cracked record saying the same old negative things that Senator Sherry has been saying since day one, the same things that he was putting to me when I was minister. He has not progressed it one iota since then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Talk about being hit with a wet lettuce: Senator Kemp today left you, Senator Sherry, for dead because your questions are completely based on false allegations and false assertions. I am sure you know that. You are simply wrong about most of the things you are saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two issues in this: the first one is the surcharge, and the second is the imple 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mentation mechanism. As I understand it, and perhaps Senator Sherry will reconfirm this, Labor do support the 15 per cent surcharge, although they seemed to back off today in an unequivocal nature. What Senator Kemp has been really concentrating on is the implementation mechanism. As he said in question time today, we have looked at all the various options for implementation and we have come to the conclusion that the proposal that we have is simply the best of the alternatives. For Labor to go on and on about that without offering an alternative to the proposal that we have is just scandalous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that what Labor appears to be trying to do is to impose the burden on a million small and medium size enterprises in Australia to absolve 130,000 or so superannuation funds from being involved in some additional administrative costs.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conclusions of the Convention on these issues were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Constitutional Guarantees Against Racial Discrimination</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Convention resolved, by a large majority, that section 25 should be removed from the Constitution. Section 25 accepts that a State might refuse to allow some Australian citizens to vote in State elections on the grounds of their race. The sanction which it offers is weak and involves excluding the same citizens from the population figures used to decide how many Members of the House of Representatives will be chosen from each State. While the section no longer has much practical significance, it seems out of place in a modern Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Convention discussed at length whether section 25 should be replaced with another provision and, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> if so, what that should be. In the end, it resolved that the Constitution should guarantee a right to vote to all Australian citizens, along the following lines:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"No government in Australia shall have the power to discriminate against any Australian citizen by denying them the right to vote".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Convention agreed that the wording of the section should allow necessary restrictions to be placed on the right to vote by, for example, setting the minimum voting age.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Convention also recommended that the preamble to the Constitution should recognise the prior occupation of Australia by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and their culture. It also noted the exclusion of Western Australia, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory from the current preamble and resolved that they should be included.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Convention discussed a range of other ways of dealing with racial discrimination, outside the Constitution. Those mentioned included better education about racial discrimination and human rights generally and the importance of political and community leaders speaking out against discrimination and setting a good example themselves. The Convention also endorsed the importance of educated, open and tolerant public debate on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An Australian Republic?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Convention resolved, by a substantial majority, that Australia should become a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A substantial majority of delegates favoured selection of a republican Head of State by a two thirds majority of each of the two Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament. The Head of State should be appointed for a five year term and should be able to be removed by the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Convention recommended that the powers of the Head of State should be spelt out in the Constitution to a greater extent than is the case at present, so that the main rules concerning the exercise of powers by the Head of State would be at least partly codified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Convention agreed unanimously that all parts of Australia should become a republic at the same time, on the basis of agreement within each State and Territory. It was also unanimously agreed that Australia should stay in the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Convention noted the importance of education about the republic and other constitutional issues, so that Australians understand their own system of government and can make informed decisions on these important questions.</PARA>

In debate on a motion to suspend standing orders, Senator Carr stated that one of the matters in issue was `the manner in which votes are brought in this place'. Senator Campbell raised a point of order that this constituted offensive words against the Senate contrary to standing order 193(3). The Acting Deputy President invited Senator Carr to make it clear that he was not reflecting on the Senate, and, on receiving an apparent assurance from Senator Carr that he was not, allowed him to proceed.

The Acting Deputy President was therefore entitled to accept the assurance of Senator Carr that he was not reflecting on the Senate and to allow him to proceed on that basis. I must say, however, that the assurance given by Senator Carr was itself somewhat ambiguous, and perhaps the chair should have sought further clarification of his meaning.

You gave an undertaking, Madam President, to table that report today, together with all correspondence and related documents. We expected you to fulfil that undertaking, and

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The allegations against Senator Colston are serious and, if proven, they affect his capacity to sit in the Senate. You have indicated that the delay is a consequence of a request from Senator Colston for more time to prepare his explanation. That is not acceptable. Senator Colston has had 12 days in which to respond. I say that surely that is sufficient. There was not such delay in the prime ministerial approval for the upgrade of Senator Colston's staff. There was no such delay in doing the deal with Senator Alston and Senator Hill over the deputy presidency of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Neither you, Madam President, nor Senator Colston apparently see any need to delay today's tabling of the Senate report on the detail of senators' travel arrangements going back five years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, the opposition does not believe the delay in the tabling of this report until Monday of next week is justified. We do accept that the additional report to which you have referred should not be tabled until Senator Colston has had a reasonable time to respond to it. If further irregularities have come to light since the report by the Department of the Senate was first given to Senator Colston, then it is appropriate that he be given the time to respond to them, but we do not accept that as an excuse for delaying the tabling of the original report. Surely in this case Senator Colston's answers to those first allegations will not be different now that there is a further report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Colston is now the subject of several departmental inquiries into alleged misuse of parliamentary entitlements&mdash;none of which, I might add, have been requested by the opposition. Two of these inquiries are being conducted by the Department of Ad 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ministrative Services. The first was requested by the minister after television footage indicated misuse of the self&hyphen;drive vehicle provided to Senator Colston in his capacity as Deputy President. The second, as I understand it, relates to the use of his charter allowance in Queensland. Anonymous spokesmen for the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) have indicated that the inquiries are even broader than this, but we have had no official confirmation to that effect. A third inquiry is being conducted by the Department of the Senate on its own initiative, and of course it is this inquiry that was later enjoined by Senator Colston, although we are not certain of the precise timing of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, until now we have accepted the government's word that Senator Colston would be treated no differently from any other parliamentarian in a similar position. Today's developments indicate that this is no longer the case. There is no doubt that he has had sufficient time and opportunity to respond to the initial Senate report. He has, nevertheless, successfully sought to defer the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are justified in asking why Senator Colston requires more time to prepare his defence. Is it the case that perhaps he is having difficulty remembering the exact details of the 777 days of travel allowance claimed in just four years from the financial years 1992 to 1996? Is he having trouble accounting for the $117,610 claimed over that four&hyphen;year period? Is he unable to explain why, in the financial year 1993&hyphen;94, he claimed travel allowance for a total of 265 days&mdash;and 265 is 72.6 per cent of the year? Is he unable to explain why he claimed $41,475 in travel allowance in that year when he was a parliamentary officeholder for only eight weeks and he was, in fact, a backbencher for the rest of the year?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is he unable to explain why Senator Hill, the then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, claimed 155 days while he, Senator Colston, claimed 265?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is he unable to explain why, on one occasion in 1993, he claimed travel allowance for 29 consecutive days and on another occasion in the same year for 28 consecutive days? Perhaps his recollection is faulty about those 28 consecutive days claimed from 27 July 1993 onwards when he claimed four days in Melbourne, one in Sydney, then three in Sydney, two in Canberra, four in Melbourne, three in Canberra, two in Sydney, seven in Canberra and two in Canberra, for a grand total, on the trot, of $6,160. Is he unable to explain why he, Senator Colston, claimed 15 or more consecutive days of travel allowance on 11 occasions since 1993?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, is he unable to explain why, between October 1993 and February 1996, he took five trips to Norfolk Island totalling 29 days and claimed over $4,000 in travel allowance? Is he unable to explain why, in the same period, he took five trips to Cocos Island and to Christmas Island totalling 17 days and claimed over $2,400 in travel allowance? Is Senator Colston unable to explain how he claimed travel allowance in Canberra for 9 June 1996, when the Senate records indicate that he stayed in Perth that night? Is he unable to explain why he claimed travel allowance in Canberra for 8 September 1994 when television footage has shown him opening a jobskills program on the Gold Coast?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is he unable to explain why, on 7 April 1996, his duties on the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances were so onerous that they required him to claim travel allowance for Easter Sunday? Put simply, it is not surprising that, given the magnitude of Senator Colston's travel allowance claims, he is having difficulty coming up with a plausible explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it not a fact that Senator Colston is having trouble explaining all of the irregularities and discrepancies which have emerged in relation to his use of parliamentary entitle 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ments because that use has, in fact, been abuse? Is it not the case that neither two weeks, two months or even two years in this case would be enough for Senator Colston to explain why his travel allowance claims do not constitute a systematic exploitation of every favourable interpretation of the travel allowance provisions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, gave an undertaking that Senator Colston would not be given preferential treatment. At least three other parliamentarians have been the subject of allegations concerning the recent use or misuse of their parliamentary entitlements. One of them has paid back a sum of money and provided a full and public explanation of the circumstances surrounding the repayment. Two others are subject to investigation by the Australian Federal Police. Consistency demands that Senator Colston be given no special favours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate is entitled to know whether the irregularities and discrepancies are merely mistakes by the Department of the Senate or poor staff work by all of Senator Colston's employees or whether they constitute systematic fraud against the Commonwealth. Senate travel documents have disappeared. Investigations are being carried out by staff who, in my view, are neither equipped nor trained for such investigations. Rights are being extended to Senator Colston which were denied to Mr Cobb and to ex&hyphen;Senator Woods. Madam President, you should end this farce now. I ask you to reconsider your position and to seek advice from the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) as to the appropriate course of action you should now take.</PARA></SPEECH>

Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions.

Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1996 is to amend the Corporations Law in light of a decision of Cohen J of the New South Wales Supreme Court, In the matter of Crawford House and Corporations Law handed down on 13 June 1995 ('the Crawford House decision'). The amendments are intended to ensure that creditors who deal directly with a company trading under a deed of company arrangement will be able to make a claim against the company's assets for outstanding 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1665"> debts and liabilities should the company go into liquidation following termination of the deed</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Reasons for Introduction and Passage in Current Autumn Sittings</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The voluntary administration scheme contained in Part 5.3A of the Corporations Law provides for a regime which allows for companies to enter voluntary administration as an alternative to immediate liquidation. Under the regime, a company may cause an administrator to be appointed. The administrator takes control of the company's business and makes an assessment of the company's affairs. Within approximately one month of appointment, the administrator is required to make a recommendation to creditors about the future of the company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statistics from the Australian Securities Commission indicate that, on average, more than one hundred companies utilise the voluntary administration procedure every month. In a significant proportion of cases, the creditors resolved that the company should enter into a deed of company arrangement rather than be wound up immediately. The advantage of taking this course from a creditor's perspective is that if the company is allowed to continue operating its business, there is a likelihood that a better return to creditors would be obtained than in an immediate winding up. The mechanism also serves to avoid the costs and delays often associated with liquidations. Indeed, these considerations were behind the voluntary administration scheme being inserted in the Corporations Law in 1993 as recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Crawford House decision it was held that where a deed of company arrangement provides for the directors to be in control of the company, rather than the deed administrator, the debts incurred by the company while trading under a deed of company arrangement do not receive priority payment, nor are they provable in a winding up. The effect of the Crawford House decision is that creditors who deal directly with a company while it is trading under a deed of company arrangement have no claim whatsoever against the company's assets for their debts in the event that the company is would up following termination of the deed. Cohen J remarked that this is not a result that could have been intended by the legislature. His Honour therefore called for urgent legislative amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the wake of the decision, there were calls for urgent amendment from a number of concerned parties including the Insolvency Practitioners' Association of Australia, the Australian Securities Commission and legal practitioners. Also, the Australian Taxation Office has been significantly adversely affected by the decision. If the law as determined in the Crawford House decision is allowed to stand, the confidence of creditors in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> deeds of company arrangement is likely to be undermined and the viability of the voluntary administration regime could be jeopardised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the period since the Crawford House decision was handed down, liquidators and their advisers have been in an invidious position because, unless they have been able to defer finalisation of the administration pending the commencement of an amendment, they would have been obliged to act in accordance with the law as stated in Crawford House, which is patently unfair to post-deed creditors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prospect of an imminent amendment to correct the anomaly was publicised in law journals and other publications following the introduction of a bill addressing the issue in October 1995 and this may have encouraged liquidators to defer finalising administrations. However, unless an appropriate amendment is passed soon, liquidators will be forced to make distributions ignoring the claims of past-deed creditors. This extremely undesirable outcome would be very difficult to correct, even by way of retrospective legislation, since it would be impracticable to provide for the "unwinding" of administrations, perhaps involving very large numbers of creditors, once they have been finalised. Accordingly, it is highly desirable that an amendment addressing the Crawford House decision is proceeded with as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Law Council of Australia and the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia have expressed their support for the approach taken in the Bill and have urged the Government to secure passage as soon as possible.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REPORT ON PUBLIC SEMINARS 20 AND 25 SEPTEMBER 1996</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[Madam President] I have pleasure in presenting the report by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on two public seminars held in Canberra last September in relation to the work of the Human Rights and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (HREOC), and the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman, which together deal with international and domestic issues relating to human rights. HREOC is a statutory body responsible for ensuring Australia's compliance with, and implementation of, international human rights treaties and conventions. The Commonwealth Ombudsman has a more domestic focus on the everyday human rights of citizens in their dealings with government agencies. The office of the Ombudsman is established within the Prime Minister and Cabinet portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through its Human Rights Sub-Committee, the Joint Standing Committee has adopted the practice of meeting on an annual basis with the heads and senior office-holders of both statutory offices. The purpose of conducting the two public seminars was to keep the Committee up to date on current work 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1673"> programs, challenges and future directions being planned for the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office and the Human Rights Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report presented today examines issues of concern to each particular office, as well as a shared concern about racism and the human rights of indigenous Australians. There are five recommendations in the report. Two of them relate to the implementation of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child and HREOC's major concerns for the children of Australia, particularly the welfare, care and protection system, and the treatment of children in the family law and juvenile justice systems. The Committee shares these concerns, and was most disappointed that no specific Act of Parliament has yet been passed to implement the Convention on the Rights of the Child nor, I should add, the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights. Back in 1994, ie Committee's report on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">the Review of Australia's Efforts to Promote and Protect Human Rights </EMPHASIS> highlighted the plight of abused children both internationally and in Australia. At that time, criticisms of the youth welfare and justice systems in Australia, and youth homelessness were drawn to the attention of the Parliament. Those warnings are even more timely today than they were in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the Australian Government introduce legislation to incorporate the International Convention on the Rights of the Child into domestic law, and recommends also that the Attorney-General investigate the feasibility of establishing a Children's Commissioner within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within the time constraints imposed by only two short meetings, the seminars could not cover in great detail all areas of concern. However, in addition to the issues to which I have already referred, the report mentions several other important areas of concern to the Committee: for example, the rights of refugees in detention, the rights of women in Australia and in the region, and the right of transgender people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the issues specific to the Ombudsman the Committee made particular note of the independent statutory role of the office which reports direct to Parliament, notwithstanding the fact that it is established within the portfolio of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. As highlighted by the Ombudsman in her annual report for l995-96, and reiterated during the seminar, this situation has given rise to funding constraints during budget considerations for the portfolio. One of the proposals put forward to the Government by the Ombudsman was for the status of an Officer of the Parliament to be applied to the Ombudsman, thereby guaranteeing its independent operation in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> terms of administrative arrangements such as budget allocation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes there is merit in strengthening the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman, and has recommended that the Government expedite the necessary changes to jurisdiction and funding arrangements proposed in the Ombudsman's annual report. As well, the Committee has recommended that a parliamentary review of the office be conducted in order to examine the resources available to the Ombudsman, the mechanisms for ensuring its independence from any specific portfolio, and the desirability of giving the Ombudsman the status of an independent officer of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A shared concern which the Committee highlighted in the report relates to the problem of racism in Australia and the difficulties faced by indigenous Australians in gaining access to services. Both HREOC and the Ombudsman have to confront racism as a significant issue raised in complaints, and clearly recognise the need for continuing support for indigenous people in the areas of health, employment, housing, education and welfare services in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ombudsman emphasised the special needs of indigenous people and the disadvantages which need to be addressed on their behalf. Both HREOC and the Ombudsman were critical of the limited access that indigenous people are able to gain to services provided for all Australians by DSS and DEETYA, for example. These difficulties were the result of the particular needs of indigenous people and the barriers erected by the current administrative arrangements for delivery of services, which can be quite complex. In the Committees view, one solution would be to fund a position within the Ombudsman's office to cater for the special needs of indigenous Australians, and the report recommends that the Government consider that option.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final observation by the Committee as a result of the seminars was that the role of both EREOC and the Ombudsman is being undermined by budgetary pressures, and the Committee foresees serious consequences if the workloads of each office continue to increase while funding and other support mechanisms are reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President I would like to conclude by thanking all involved in the seminars for their contributions&mdash;Sir Ronald Wilson, President of HREOC, Mr Chris Sidoti, Human Rights Commissioner, and the Senior Adviser to the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Kieren Fitzpatrick, and the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Ms Philippa Smith&mdash;who gave their time to attend and to inform the Committee about their work I would also like to thank the members of the Committee who were able to attend the seminars and the staff of the Joint Standing Committee, in particular, Margaret Swie

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Regulations (Amendment), as contained in statutory rules 1996 No. 277 and made under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In speaking to that motion, firstly, I would like to draw the attention of the Senate to the report of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority for 1995-96. In that report the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority noted as its goals and aims, among other things, `to involve the community meaningfully in the care and development of the marine park,' and further down, `to minimise costs of caring for and developing the marine park consistent with meeting the goals and other aims of the authority'. Quite clearly, the extra charge that has been put in place through the regulations is an impost and is totally at odds with those particular goals which I read out, along with the other goals of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority&mdash;GBRMPA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is quite clearly a broken promise of the Howard government&mdash;one more of their broken promises. Of course, it flies in the face of what they told the tourist industry on 13 February 1996 in the lead-up to the election held last year. A document circulated by the Far North Queensland Promotion Bureau of Australia has an extract of that promise which was made by the coalition at that stage. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition in Government will honour its long-term promise to this industry of no new taxes and no increases in existing taxes on this industry and its service industries.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So it is quite clear, quite unequivocal, that the promise made to the tourist industry in Cairns was that there would be no new charges, no new taxes. The extract further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will not be introducing any new taxes or increasing any existing taxes on the tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1675"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. No New Taxes or Tax Increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> &hyphen; that is an unequivocal commitment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We know how far that commitment went. It did not last very long at all. No sooner were the coalition in government than we in the Queensland tourist industry found ourselves confronted with another tax, a new tax, an increased tax&mdash;in this case a fivefold increase in the tax on the tourist industry. This tax was not well received by the tourist industry at all&mdash;far from it. There was total revulsion at what the government had done. There had been no consultation. As a consequence, the government found themselves in a sticky situation. They found themselves in a lot of trouble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, this belies what they had done when the environment management charge was originally introduced back in 1993. It is worth while looking at what was said by some of the speakers from the other side in the speeches in the second reading debates that took place in both the House of Representatives and in this chamber. I refer firstly to what Mr Jull, the member for Fadden, had to say at page 868 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on 13 May 1993 about the introduction of the then environment management charge:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We hope that those operators will get a sympathetic hearing from this government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">meaning the then Labor government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">about any future charges. While the principle of user pays is a good one, we must ensure that we do not overcrowd the industry with charges to the extent that we become non-competitive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the same debate on the same day at page 869, Mr Miles, the member for Braddon, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we are going to raise moneys to support our world heritage areas in a piecemeal fashion, the administrative costs involved will probably outweigh the benefits. I suggest to both sides of the House that it might be better to raise those moneys through general revenue rather than continuing with the present piecemeal approach, such as we are seeing here, of adding a dollar to fares and so on. I am sure that the administrative costs involved for the operators and the overall administration&mdash;the government and departmental structures&mdash;far outweigh the benefit of a $1 increase. Furthermore, I do not see it staying at $1.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What prophetic words from a person speaking at the introduction of a $1 charge back in 1993. Whilst opposing that charge he said that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> he could not see that charge remaining at $1. Of course, the prophecy has been fulfilled. Mr Miles went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No doubt it will rise, and rise rapidly. That will be just the start of it&mdash;the thin edge of the wedge. We need to think more carefully about how we fund our world heritage areas.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When we turn to the second reading debate that took place in this Senate, we get to the real gems. Senator Ian Macdonald, at page 1309 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  of 26 May 1993 says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry is concerned that it is the thin edge of the wedge: $1 today, $5 tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How the coalition must have had a crystal ball in those days to see that they would be in government and that they would be the perpetrators of not raising it from $1 to $5, but raising it to $6. Senator Ian Macdonald went on to say in the second reading debate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . It is something that we will watch very closely, as the tourist operators and many other people, including myself, have very real fears that this will not be so easy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further on in the transcript he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I will certainly be joining other members of the Liberal and National parties in monitoring the situation and the regulations as they come through. We will do so to ensure that the tax which is being introduced now is not the thin edge of the wedge; that it stops where it says it will; and that it is not used by this Government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">meaning the then Labor government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as a crutch to enable it to stop funding the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Rather than the Government using Consolidated Revenue to fund what is a very important research and maintenance agency which protects one of Australia's greatest assets, funding in the future should be by way of an increase in the tax.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I cite those three instances because that is what this debate is about today. When in opposition the now government were vehemently opposed to the imposition of the first $1, which was an environment management charge. I will come to that in a few moments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then they went on to say that they thought it was the thin edge of the wedge and that, as the thin edge of the wedge, it was something that should be looked out for and that one should look out for the regulations. So we have the disallowance motion here today seeking the disallowance of the increased 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1676"> charges that have been imposed unfairly on the tourist industry by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One only has to look at how they have hurt the tourist operators in that area. I quote from a letter sent to me by Tusa Dive, one of the operators in the Cairns region, referring to the announcement by the government of the increased tax in the budget last year. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only alternative presented to us is to absorb the charge into our existing rates, which, as a small operator, with competitive rates based on marginal profitability, may potentially send Tusa Dive Charters to the wall.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the second point of concern over the lack of consultation to arrive at this decision to increase the Reef Tax, we consider this action to be an act of betrayal of trust on the part of the Federal Government. The Prime Minister, John Howard had stated previously this year&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, 1996&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that there would be no increases or new charges.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Here we have, quite clearly, not a big operator but a small operator who has suffered at the hands of the government after they clearly spelt out in their election promise that there would be no increase in charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, I quote from a letter from Mr Blue Bulling, the chair of the Cairns Regional Marine Resources Advisory Committee. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . There was disbelief, obvious disgust and distress that a 500% increase could be levied with no regard for the consultative mechanisms which have been painstakingly developed and proven efficient over the past two years. Members are truly terrified of the potential to broaden this precedence and the potential impacts that such political decisions will cause.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This political decision is seriously threatening and has jeopardised an enormous amount of hard won good will and future potential for community/government relations. It is not the act of a responsible political party within a democracy. It is a grave error and must be quickly revisited and dealt with through a process of consultation and resolution within the existing structures if damage is to be mitigated.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Following on from that, the government did set about trying to retrieve the position. They tried to save themselves from a fate worse than death&mdash;that is, a complete revolt by the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tourist operators in North Queensland. What they came up with in the end was not satisfactory to the needs of the tourist operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one thing that this government have never understood&mdash;that the environment management charge was never meant to be something by which the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority was funded. It was always designed to be something which operated as a research facility for the cooperative research centre of the Great Barrier Reef. Seventy-five per cent of what was collected out of those dollars was to go to research; 25 per cent was always destined to go to GBRMPA as a management charge for their collection of the fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government have now turned that around and are trying to use whatever they can get out of this charge and whatever they can get out of the additional tourist visitor charge. What they are trying to do with that is fund the operations of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which it was never designed to do under any circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have dropped the increase from $1 to $6 back to $1 to $2. They may feel that that is some comfort for the tourist operators, but it is quite the opposite. In its place, whilst they have dropped the environment management charge from $6 now back to $2, they have put a $4 tourist visitor impost on users of commercial facilities and craft in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Surprise, surprise, the tourist operators are still upset. No wonder, because this impost is something which will affect their livelihood, their ability to operate and their ability to attract people into the tourist area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 26 November last year, a motion was passed in this chamber referring the issue of heritage access fees in general to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee. This is the matter that was referred at that time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question of balancing public access with the principle of "user pays" in order to defray the public costs of maintaining natural and cultural heritage assets such as national parks and museums with particular consideration to issues of fairness and equity. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1677">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That inquiry is proceeding and has not concluded at this stage, and of course one does not really know what that committee will find. What we are faced with here is a premature action on the part of the government in pursuing the increase in the environmental management charge from $1 up to $2. The tourist operators say that this increased charge will impact on them. This was brought out in recent correspondence that I have from the Tourism Council of Australia. It is interesting to see how they view the charge that has been imposted on the industry by the current government. I will quote in part from that letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TCA would like to take this opportunity to outline this policy&mdash;a "user pays" approach should be transparent and should only apply where:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> all users/beneficiaries can be identified,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the charge can be applied fairly to all users,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> revenue collected is entirely hypothecated to the delivery of goods and services,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> there is appropriate advance consultation with the businesses affected and there is an appropriate lead time for the introduction of changes to the charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The action taken on 20 August&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is in 1996&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">does not meet any of the previously agreed criteria.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further on they say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The imposition of an additional cost at such short notice, just 4 months notice, puts operators in a most difficult position. Contracts with wholesalers are quoted and signed quite a long way in advance i.e. around 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They then go on to cite how far out some of the contracts that they have with travel agents go. The Tourism Council of Australia goes on to say at page 3 of this letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would seem to confirm the industry's worst fears that the Government merely intends to direct the monies into consolidated revenue or at best use the funds as a replacement/substitute for the Government funding the administration of GBRMPA&mdash;again the agreement has been dishonoured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the EMC will not be per visitor per day as suggested in the Budget papers but in reality is per visitor per activity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have pointed that during other debates in this place, and that has just been like water on the duck's back to this government. As this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> letter rightly points out, the more activities you undertake on the reef, the more charges you will be confronted with. Then the council goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tourism industry has contended for a number of years, that all users of the Park can be readily identified and should be subject to the EMC, however, there has been no attempt to ensure that the Charge is fairly applied to all "users".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the very thing that the heritage access inquiry under the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee is trying to establish&mdash;the very thing. Yet here we have the government pursuing a charge which the operators on the reef quite clearly do not want any part of because they know it will only serve to damage them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth while looking at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Queensland parliament of 13 September 1996. At page 2900 Ms Warwick, the member for Barron River&mdash;coincidentally, an area that would have close affinity to the tourist industry and the problems suffered by the increases in the reef tax&mdash;directed a question to the Minister for Tourism, Small Business and Industry, Mr Davidson. The question basically asked who will be affected by the proposed increase in the environmental management charge. It was interesting that, during the response, the Queensland minister referred to a letter that had been sent to both the Hon. John Moore and Senator Robert Hill which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The planned increase, combined with a 3% per cent reduction in Federal funding to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, seems to suggest the Federal Government is neglecting part of its responsibility and shifting the onus for the management of the Marine Park further towards the tourism operators in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is precisely what the tourism operators are saying. It is the precise reason why this particular increase in charges should be disallowed here in this chamber this afternoon. This is not something put forward by my side of politics but by their own side in the Queensland government. The other matter which concerns me greatly is the impact on jobs in that area. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1678"> presuming the Australian Democrats and the Greens will be supporting us in this motion because they have been demanding an increase in user fees for our natural resources. But it is astonishing what a few feet make. On this side of the chamber the ALP introduced and defended an environmental management charge for the Great Barrier Reef. On the other side they condemn it. They talk about it now&mdash;to quote Senator Hogg&mdash;as an `impost' at odds with the GBRMPA goals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not remember hearing any of that in 1993 when the Labor Party believed that it was a fair contribution towards the costs of research and maintenance of the reef. Certainly, 75 per cent of the $1 charge was to go to the CRC for research, but nobody seriously suggested that the other 25 per cent was what it cost to collect the money because in fact the collection is carried out by the commercial users. Therefore, the cost to GBRMPA is very slight indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened to the 25 per cent was that it went towards GBRMPA's operating charges. I suggest to the Senate this afternoon that that is totally reasonable because what we are faced with is the challenge of the maintenance of a vitally important environmental resource which is subject to ever growing commercial pressure. The area of greatest growth has been in relation to tourism. The type of growth and therefore the type of inroads into and pressure on the reef is very different from what was once envisaged. Now there are modern vessels and very large numbers of tourists being able to be moved to outer reefs in a short period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The responsibility therefore of the management authority, GBRMPA, has grown enormously. It has a responsibility on behalf of government to ensure that this valid use of the reef for commercial advantage nevertheless remains within an environmentally responsive wavelength; in other words, that whilst tourism grows it operates in a way that does not put undue pressure on a very important natural environment resource.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does cost a lot of money. GBRMPA costs the taxpayers as a whole about $14.75 million a year and it gets an extra million dollars from industry. So it is nearly up to $16 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million a year in its costs. What does this contribution from commercial operators, calculated on the basis of individual usage, contribute? At the moment it is about $1.2 million. This regulation, if it is allowed to stand today, would contribute for this year 1996&hyphen;97 a further $750,000 and for 1997&hyphen;98 it would contribute an extra $1.5 million. But it remains a very small proportion of the total management cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trend everywhere now is to look for a fairer share of the financial burden of maintaining our natural environmental assets between the taxpayers at large and the particular users&mdash;commercial, recreational or whatever they may be. It has not been the case in the past. Australia has been a little different from much of the world in that we have in the past basically accepted that that burden should fall totally upon taxpayers as a whole. It is now recognised that that is not the fairest way to approach these things; that those who gain the pleasure or the commercial advantage, but who as a result put direct extra pressure on those environmental assets, should be prepared to pay a bit as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is all we are seeking from this regulation. What this regulation predominantly does is increase the charge from $1 to $2. I remind you that the vast majority of these visitors are those who take trips to the outer reef from Cairns or Port Douglas and who are paying $120 or $130 for the pleasure of doing so. What the government is saying is that $2 towards the cost of maintaining the reef, which is only a small proportion of the total cost, is more than reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is only a party in opposition, I might say, that would have the nerve to come in here and try to argue that that is unreasonable. A fee of $2 compared with what is being charged in other parks protecting natural environmental assets is also particularly low. Those who have the privilege and the pleasure of entering Uluru or Kakadu, for example, pay an entry fee of $15. If you enter the Kosciusko National Park you pay $12. That is per car. If there is more than one person in the car the fee still remains at $12, so if there are two people in the car the cost is $6 a head, three times the fee that we are propos 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1679"> ing in relation to the Great Barrier Reef. One could go on. It is an aim of government to find a fairer mix of meeting this financial responsibility. We strongly argue that $2 is more than reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Hogg said, eventually we want a fee of $6 but the balance of $4 will be subject to a separate regulation later this year and I suspect will be subject to a further motion of disallowance. That debate will be had at a later date. But this debate is simply about increasing the fee from $1 to $2. It is predominantly about that; there are some extra fees for other commercial uses which have been doubled as well. But they are a small percentage of the total part of the revenue of $1.5 million in a full year. What has been said in the past about the direction that we are taking? We thought it was interesting to note the advice we have just received from the House of Representatives in its examination of world heritage areas and their maintenance. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A convincing argument can be made for charging those who benefit most from world heritage areas, either financially or as visitors. It is argued that, while Australian taxpayers as a whole contribute through government funding to world heritage management, those who reap special rewards from the areas by earning a living from tourism or through their experiences while visiting the areas should make an additional financial contribution.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is from page 169 of the report. It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee considers that where it is feasible to collect fees, they should be more than a token amount.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is on page 183 of the report. So even the House of Representatives seems to recognise that this is a sensible direction to take. And so have others. It was interesting, when I was thumbing through the records, to note that the Leader of the Opposition in this place, Senator Faulkner, seemed to have had a different view on these things when he was environment minister. Speaking of a user pays fee, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  of 19 May 1994, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can't shy away from the need to have a look at&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the fee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the pressures from the number of tourists going to those World Heritage areas is going to be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enormous and we have a responsibility to protect their values.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So it is not surprising that he is not participating in the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say in passing that I am a bit disappointed in Senator Cook, too. Having giving this notice, he has decided that it is not worthy of support by leading the debate, but I guess he has other priorities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This disallowance motion has been a very difficult one for us to assess because there are many arguments on both sides. Labor are moving to disallow the reef tax regulation. They are seeking to capitalise on very strong industry and North Queensland reaction which apparently is causing considerable disaffection in the ranks of North Queensland backbenchers, particularly those from the National Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These allowances particularly affect the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, but it must be remembered that that is not an authority which is universally loved. It has been attacked by coalition politicians and by sections of the tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The allowances affect the environmental management charge, also known as the reef 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1680"> tax. With the original increase, as Senator Hill has said, the amount of revenue raised from the EMC was to go from $1.5 million in 1995&hyphen;96 to $8 million in 1996-97. The government's intention was to raise the EMC from $1 to $6 and to reduce the budget of the GBRMPA so that the net budget outcome was nearly even. Under that budget, the authority's appropriation was to be reduced by almost $6 million, from $15 million to $10.6 million. Therefore, the net budget outcome for the authority was to be just $0.28 million net and, according to well placed sources, most of this would go to collection activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After strong political and local Queensland reaction, the government decided to introduce a two-part tax. The EMC was to go from $1 to $2 from 1 January 1997 and a $4 tourist visitor charge was to be levied from 1 January 1998. The supplementary budget does have provision to make up for the shortfall in the authority's funding, but the overall decrease will be 3.2 per cent for 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tourism industry appears to accept user pays as a principle. I do not, as a general principle, and I regret that they do. They are strongly opposed to a two-part tax. They are strongly opposed to a significant increase in tax. They are strongly opposed to acting as tax collectors. They are opposed to the retrospective aspects of the tax, since some groups are already booked two years hence. And they are strongly opposed to the cumulative effect of the increased charges on families and regular users of the reef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The levy on commercial facilities and craft is particularly unpopular, even if Senator Hill chooses to say it is a minor part of the appropriation. It is a minor but very hurtful part. These charges as a disallowable instrument cannot be amended. They can only be thrown out. That is the problem facing us and that is why I suspect both the opposition and ourselves have had particular difficulty with the package that is before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two most recent thorough reviews have together recommended an increase of some $3.5 million per year for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to allow it to fulfil its responsibilities. The government 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy would result in a classic situation of conflict of interest. We in Western Australia are particularly familiar with that. Our own department of CALM&mdash;which I refer to as `Genghis Calm'&mdash;is both an exploiter, or a beneficiary of exploitation, and the regulator manager. That is what the authority is being pushed towards&mdash;a CALM type arrangement. It is clear that governments in this country, and it seems in many countries, are trying to divert management and management authorities away from protection and towards exploitation, and towards being dependent upon the very exploitations that they are there to regulate and correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats have the following feelings about these charges. We condemn the government for reducing the core budget funding to the authority. We actually think the authority needs more funding, not less, to do a very substantial job in a very important area. We would like to push not just for the maintenance of existing budget but for an increase in line with the review recommendations which, as I mentioned earlier, amount to at least $3.5 million more being needed. We condemn the government for attempting to increasingly link the authority's financial and operational viability to tourist income. Any user charge should supplement the authority and not affect its core appropriations and operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support the Labor Party's disallowance motion on the basis that the move to a reliance on a user&hyphen;pays charge is bad policy for this particular national and world facility. You cannot just accept user pays as a principle which applies in every case. Sometimes certainly it is appropriate, and the Democrats would accept that in certain parts and certain instances, but not in this instance. That great world marine park facility needs a fearlessly independent, well-funded Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. That means government funding, not funding by tourists.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We reserve our judgment on the further $4 so-called tourist visitor charge, or tax. The Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) is going to have to provide a good explanation as to how that is going to be hypothecated to the protection and management of the reef and not be a substitute for a diminution in government funding for those functions before he gets our support on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens do not support the principle that user pays should be the only means or the principal means by which to fund our great heritage assets in this country. We do not support the idea that commercial operators who are profiting from those assets, which are the property of the people of Australia as a whole, not make a specific contribution to the upkeep. After all, they form part of the management and protection of the reef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest to the government that it look at the way in which this tax is levied. The tax does not discriminate between the small operator, the low fee collector, and the big wealthy operator who is charging big fees to richer clientele. It needs to be tailored to that direction. Those people who are profiting most, who have the clientele who use the reef in a way the average person would not, ought to be paying proportionately. That is, this tax ought to relate to the amount of money that the commercial operators are charging the clientele for using the reef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate that the Greens support this levy increase because we are concerned about the Barrier Reef. But, if the government wants support for the further tax, it does not have it as I stand here. It is going to have to show that the tax is not a substitute for a withdrawal of public funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been unable to get the exact figures on reduction in public funding through government revenues for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. The government will not get further support unless it can do better so far as we Greens are concerned. Our basic line in all such difficult matters is this: 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what is good for heritage itself; what is good for the Barrier Reef?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not going to allow ourselves to be drawn into a process of saying that it does not matter who the operator is or how rich it is or how much Keith Williams is going to make from his damaging and destructive operation in the  Hinchinbrook Channel with the 200&hyphen;plus high&hyphen;speed motor boats operating there which threaten the dugongs and the rest of the environment of that place, and that we will not collect any revenue from him and his operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That obnoxious development ought not to be proceeding. But, seeing as the government has given it the go&hyphen;ahead, against the interests of both the wet tropics world heritage area and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park world heritage area, there ought to be money coming from that wealthy businessman, who is profiting improperly and unnecessarily from these magnificent world heritage areas, to put towards assuaging some of the damage which he and his supporters are going to wreak upon these fragile and magnificent wild places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we ensure the public has access to these places without being put under an undue impost. Also, it is important that the heritage areas are adequately funded.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8O6">Senator O'BRIEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The committee considered the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill and the Reform of Employment Services Bill and, in addition, consequential amendment bills to both. I believe the submissions received by the committee were, considering the impact of the proposed legislation, of a very high standard. I want to congratulate, in particular, those who made submissions on behalf of ACOSS, ACROD, the Welfare Rights Centre, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Community and Public Sector Union and, of course, the submissions put to the committee by the various departments to make clear the impact of the legislation. Because there was a limited reporting time due to the government's desire to have this legislation dealt with in the current session before Easter, there was a great deal of work involved, especially in the preparation of the minority report of which I am a signatory. In particular I wanted to thank staffers Christina Valentine, Andrew Scott and Catherine Wildermuth for their assistance in the preparation of that report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bills in question, as I said earlier, are extremely important in terms of their impact on the legislative framework that affects the unemployed and many social security beneficiaries in this country. Firstly, the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill has the effect of creating a one&hyphen;stop shop or agency where beneficiary recipients can conduct their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1683"> business. I understand that it will not necessarily be single premises or a building in each case; it might be that closely located buildings provide that service. The opposition has no in principle opposition to the creation of such an agency, subject to comments which I will be making and which the minority report makes in relation to the Reform of Employment Services Bill. It seems that those bills go hand in hand in terms of the operation of the new agency and the new regime in so far as the unemployed are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the service delivery matter, there was a concern expressed that there needed to be a transparency of ministerial control of the agency. In that regard, the minority report deals with certain necessary amendments to the bill to ensure that any government directions to the agency and the board of the agency in relation to the administration of government policy be reported in the annual report of the board of the agency to the parliament so that there can be proper scrutiny of the operations of the agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, because of the operation of the agency as both a purchaser of services and a provider of services, there was also concern expressed in the minority report that those roles needed to be separated and that some of those roles would be more appropriately provided by the department rather than the agency and that appropriate amendments to the bill would be moved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, there is no in principle opposition to the bill. In relation to the Reform of Employment Services Bill, however, there is a great deal of concern. This is a piece of legislation which will repeal the Employment Services Act. It is a bill which contains most of the labour market programs which arose under the previous government, particularly under the Working Nation program. It also leads to the disappearance of a universally available labour exchange service for all Australians. It replaces a service that was not restricted with a set of services which are restricted in their application to Australians. That can be borne out by looking at simple statistics. Over the last year, the CES assisted over 500,000 Australians with gaining work but the funding provided for the new agency 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will make provision to assist only 300,000. The reason for that is that the universality of the service will disappear with the CES's disappearance under this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also effectively provides for the privatisation of employment services and for the creation of employment placement enterprises. Be they community based or for&hyphen;profit organisations, they will operate pursuant to the legislation&mdash;on a fee for result basis&mdash;and that creates a problem in itself. Originally, the government announced that a public employment placement enterprise would be created and would be part of this legislation. Late last year, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) retracted that announcement and stated that the public employment placement enterprise, the name of which would be decided subsequently, would, in fact, be established as a commercial corporation under the Corporations Law. That decision creates some concerns for the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One particular concern is that the very existence of the public employment placement enterprise will be beyond the control of the parliament and can, therefore, disappear at the whim of the government without this parliament having any say in the matter. That is a matter which has been addressed closely in the minority report and will receive further attention in the debate on this legislation. So the government has backtracked on its original position and there is a need for that matter to be closely addressed when this bill comes before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also major concerns expressed in the report about the equitable delivery of employment services to the unemployed, particularly revolving around the fact that payment for the employment placement enterprises is outcomes based, and a fear that there would be, effectively, creaming of the unemployed by these placement enterprises, that is, placing those who are easiest to place because it is an easier fee to get and concentrating less on the more difficult to place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the latest unemployment figures released, I think today, we see that the long&hyphen;term unemployed figures have risen by 14,000 in the month of February. That is of great 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1684"> concern. It will be an even greater concern to the opposition if we lose the ability to guarantee that there will be special attention paid to the long&hyphen;term unemployed, as has been paid under the Working Nation program, where, whilst there is a higher fee for placing long&hyphen;term unemployed, there is a greater cost in providing the services necessary to make the long&hyphen;term unemployed job ready and, therefore, in our opinion, disincentive for the employment placement enterprises to do the job for the long&hyphen;term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, of course, the legislation&mdash;the downgrading of the CES, the disappearance of the universal labour exchange&mdash;will see 3,000 to 6,000 jobs go in the public sector and, at a time when unemployment is rising, that is not a good figure for the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the opposition and the Democrats have many concerns about the bill which will come before the parliament in this session. It is a bill which puts into place a risky strategy. The question which this chamber must ultimately answer is whether we are prepared to take the risks which the minister advocates on behalf of Australian unemployed because the price of failure is greater misery for the unemployed and the consequential social dislocation that that will create.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think from reading through your amendment and the revised running sheet&mdash;we now have amendment No. 62 which was not on the earlier running sheet&mdash;I can sum up the difference between the government's position and the opposition's position, and you may correct me if I am wrong on this because there has been shifting sand with things being rewritten. Our recommendation was that we wanted it guaranteed by the year 2000 that all Australian telephone subscribers would have access to digital data capability or 64 kilobits per second. I think your amendment and comments indicate that by 1998 some 94 per cent of the population would have that capacity but by 2000 it would still not be guaranteed that the last two or three per cent would be achieved. I think what you are offering is a review of the progress being made by the carriers to get that figure to see what would be achieved by 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition believes, without being too prescriptive, that it is not unreasonable to guarantee people in regional and rural Australia that they should have access to digital data capability. Our amendment makes it clear that we do not believe with the last few per cent that you have to roll the fibre cable out and put satellites up with empty capacity just in case. What you have to do is put it there so that if someone wants it they can reasonably be connected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, that is the difference between our positions. Some people might ask why we are arguing about six per cent of subscribers. I think it is reasonable. Generally, people in the bush feel put upon about this. Have I described the differences between your position and my position correctly? I accept the fact that there has been some shifting around with drafting and so on even in the last day or so and I may now not understand the difference.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. Opposition recommendation No. 10 stated that the bill should include an objects clause stating that it is an objective of the proposed act that digital data capability be available to all Australians by the year 2000. The requirement contained in our amendments is that 1 July 1997 be the date for Telstra to provide ISDN capability or its equivalent, which is really what we are talking about here, to 93.4 per cent of the population&mdash;people who live within five kilometres of a local exchange. To get to 96 per cent by the year 2000, which is the difference between 96 per cent and 93.4 per cent, which is 2.6 per cent, involves people who live beyond that area but not in the remotest parts of the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last four per cent, to take it to 100, are those people who currently rely on digital remote concentrator systems and are therefore simply beyond the reach of ISDN for practical purposes. Those people will need to rely on new technologies or an upgrade of DRCS. I think all the signs are encouraging in terms of satellites. That is the harder part of the equation. Telstra is committed to ongoing research to ensure that they are brought within the ambit of what the other 96 per cent will have by the year 2000. It is really people within five kilometres of the local exchange who are the 93.4 per cent. It is those beyond that, but not in the remotest parts of the community, who are the next 2.4 per cent. The last four per cent are those who are in the outer reaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recognise that it is a desirable objective to aspire to having national coverage, but the concern we have is that, if you effectively mandate that for the year 2000, you are locking the carrier, or carriers, into technol 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1687"> ogy that may not be appropriate and that may indeed change very dramatically over the next few years. That is why our amendment No. 62 would require the minister of the day to conduct a review before the year 2000 to determine whether a requirement to make ISDN available should be included in the USO. In other words, we do not have any quarrel about that aspiration; it is simply a matter of remaining flexible in the means of achieving it. We certainly do not want to see the last four per cent left behind anymore than you do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The view we take is that it would be irresponsible to simply lock in existing ISDN technology, for example, when there may be plenty of other ways of achieving it or when, indeed, it might already have been delivered quite voluntarily. So rather than having the straitjacket of a total requirement&mdash;and bearing in mind what came out of the standard telephone service review&mdash;if you go down the path you are proposing, you are effectively wanting a blank cheque.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not know whether it might cost one or more billion dollars, but certainly the only evidence that came out of that report was that there was a very big question mark over the cost and that the responsible way of proceeding was, therefore, to have your review in due course and try to get a handle on the costs and then you may be able to go that extra step, if it is affordable. We would be confident that there would be other means of getting there in any event but, if there are not, you will have this review to look at whether they ought to be included in the USO.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, in terms of what you have just stated about the government's desirable objective to achieve that ISDN service, and not wanting to be put in a straitjacket, if you like, in terms of defining the type of technology, can you comment on the fact that the opposition's amendment actually specifies that we should ensure that a carriage service that provides a digital data capability comparable to an ISDN channel becomes available to all people? So the nature of our amendment is not technol 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ogy specific; it in fact allows for the precise flexibility that you are arguing is required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I put to you, Minister, that, with respect to that, our amendment provides for all of that flexibility you were looking for in that we are not seeking a technology specific outcome with respect to this. We are stating a desired aim and, as you said, a desired objective, but in fact the wording of our amendment provides for a `digital data capability comparable to an ISDN channel to become available by 1 January 2000'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this way, the two per cent at issue and the four per cent in the remote areas can in fact be included in this clause because we are not arguing for a technology specific outcome and the flexibility does exist. So I put to you that it is within your position to support the opposition amendment on this particular issue of a standard telephone service by 1 January 2000.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME><STATE> (South Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(5.48 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lundy has very eloquently made the point that we have not made it ISDN specific. We have made it comparable to ISDN so that we have a measure, so that we are not trying to write into legislation specific technology. There is advice around, and some comments may or may not be correct, that ISDN may be overtaken by new developments, and we have all conceded that. So that is why we have made it comparable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The further point I want to make is about why we believe it ought to be the objective of 100 per cent by the year 2000. Some people in the cities might say, `The last two or three per cent, what do they matter?' Apart from the issue of a telecommunication system serving all Australians equally and efficiently, there is also the issue that having access to decent on&hyphen;line services in many of these remote areas will be, in my view, a major advantage in the growth of the pastoral industry and the tourist industry in particular. For example, someone in a remote area of Australia running a high quality tourist resort, say, in the Kimberleys, may see real advantages in marketing their tourist resort directly around the world on the Internet or through similar on-line services. They will get a real marketing advantage. They will be directly in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1688"> control of their own bookings. They will be directly in control of putting information out. They will not be relying on agencies in between who take 10 per cent or 15 per cent, which may well be their profit margin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is not just the fact that it is only three per cent or four per cent&mdash;and I acknowledge that the minister probably wants to get it connected as much as we do. If Telstra in particular is the dominant carrier and has an investment program running at $4 billion or $5 million a year, and over the next four years that is going to be about a $20 billion investment program, irrespective of privatisation or not&mdash;the third privatisation&mdash;we think it is not unreasonable in the national interest that it has this objective put on it so it cannot get out of it. As we in this chamber all know, sooner or later someone will complain that there is discrimination, and with the new technologies we ought to make sure no Australian is discriminated against. We believe that what we are offering is reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to point out to the minister that, in our amendment&mdash;amendment No. 5 on document 412, which has been circulated&mdash;we say the ACA must monitor and report each financial year to the minister of the progress made by carriers and carriage service providers towards the attainment of the objective referred to in paragraph (32)(aa), which is the objective of 100 per cent. Minister, I note your new clause 62, which has been circulated today, says that, before 1 January 2000, the minister must cause to be conducted a review to determine whether a carriage service that provides a digital data capability is broadly comparable. You are offering an unspecified time. The review may be as late as some time in the latter half of 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also believe that there is an advantage in saying to Telstra and the carriers that ACA is conducting a review every year on progress&mdash;to keep them up to the mark, so that in late 1999 they do not say, `This is impossible to achieve now: you have got to give us another couple of years.' If they are having problems on delivery, every year between now and 2000 the ACA ought to be asking 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them to provide information on how they are progressing towards attainment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If our amendment to this legislation&mdash;that it has got to be provided for 100 per cent by the year 2000&mdash;is accepted and is not achievable technically, and they then come to us in 1999 saying, `We cannot achieve it, but you have been getting reports from us every year through this period through the ACA, which we have seen as a transparent process about it,' those are reasonable processes to put into place to achieve the objective. As far as the objective is concerned, I concede the government's and our own position&mdash;we would all love to have 100 per cent by the year 2000. The process is the matter here. But a firm objective will put an extra bit of sting on the carriers, to make sure they get there and have the ACA reviewing their progress each year.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You could say that the 93.4 per cent are those people who live in the metropolitan areas and within reasonable reach of regional centres. Then you have the people in the most remote parts, and then this four per cent&mdash;the in&hyphen;betweens who are more than five kilometres from a local exchange but not so far out that they are on DRCS.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will explain the logic of this&mdash;to get to 96 per cent, you are not mandating it so that it is effectively provided to every household. It is a digital data capability. Therefore, it will be provided essentially on a commercial basis to those 96 per cent of people. The really hard issue is the four per cent remainder. On a foreseeable basis, that will be non&hyphen;commercial, although you cannot tell quite what new technology is around the corner. But, assuming that it is non&hyphen;commercial, it makes sense to do that as part of a USO review. In other words, the way the system works is that, if it is commercial, the carriers deliver it and they do not need much incentive to do it; you might have a mandated requirement that they have timetables. But it is the non&hyphen;commercial stuff that will never otherwise be delivered, and that is why you have a universal service obligation. That is why our amendment says you ought to be looking at whether you need to extend the USO to cover that last four per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no objection to bringing that forward. Responding to your point that you do not do anything until the year 2000, we could commence that review during 1998 so that you have plenty of time to do what is affordable. But what we are trying to avoid is a situation where you are requiring ISDN  or ISDN comparable technology when, on the current state of information, you have only got ISDN&mdash;and we know that it is going to be prohibitively expensive for the last four per cent. That is what comes out of the standard telephone service report.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority report simply says that the cost of universal coverage should not be unreasonable. We do not know what the cost is&mdash;they do not assist us in that regard. The report contains very little quantitative information to support its recommendation regarding a digital data capability. You are therefore left with saying, `What do you want&mdash;a blank cheque?' because you only know whether it is affordable when you have had your review, based on the state of current technology. By 1998, it may be that there will be brand&hyphen;new, very cheap technology that will enable you to say, `We can impose this requirement; it is not a problem.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, if you are technologically no further advanced than now, you might say, `That last four per cent could cost a couple of billion dollars.' Senator Schacht, I know your view is, `What is a couple of billion dollars when you have got a cap of four or five billion?' The fact is that that is already in the system, committed to important upgrades&mdash;whether of the can or of roll&hyphen;outs or whatever else. You cannot say, `Because you have got a track record of spending some billions of dollars, an extra one or two in the lead&hyphen;up to 2000 does not matter.'</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But that is precisely why I say you ought to have your review to determine whether it is affordable in the scheme of things. But your requirement would say, `By hook or by crook&mdash;irrespective of cost&mdash;you have got to get there by 2000.' What I am saying to you is that, once they get beyond 1996, they have got to provide the last four per cent irrespective of cost. If the cost is some billions of dollars, it is no use shrugging your hands and saying, `Too bad. You have got to wear it.' We are saying, `Do the responsible thing. Do it in stages.' In principle, we do not have any objection to it being done but, if it did turn out to cost two or three billion, the most sensible thing to do would be to look at the best way of getting there in the most appropriate time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You may say, `Well, maybe we would need to go a bit beyond 2000 because there is new

Maybe if somebody can deliver 52 kilobits per second by a much cheaper method, then you might accept that.' All we are saying is, `Do it in stages so that at each step along the way you know pretty much what the cost is going to be.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is a fundamental difference between 96 and 100 because 96 per cent is commercial. The last 4,000 is uncommercial, and it therefore ought to be included in the USO. The only way you will ever get a handle on that is to do a review. The USO, as we know, only cost $230 million, so if you were to suddenly include this and it cost $1 billion you would be quadrupling the current USO and you would be fundamentally changing the whole concept.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Further on that point, Minister, you talk about the unknown costs being the reason why this aim cannot be specified but at the same time we are debating this in the context of moving towards a deregulated telecommunications market. Our amendment seeks to provide an incentive for the carriers to actually invest in perhaps some research and development to move in the direction of being able to provide these capabilities to some of our more remote geographical locations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Stating this as an aim really highlights one of the great strengths of the Australian telecommunications industry and what has driven Telstra previously to the point of being a world leader in delivering very high standard and high speed telecommunications to remote areas.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By removing that incentive of forcing carriers to actually address what is a very difficult exercise&mdash;and, I am sure, as you have said, an exercise that will involve some expense&mdash;you are effectively cancelling out or unarming what has been in the past a great

Let's say that new technology will emerge within the time frame that we are setting so that magically by the year 2000 it will all be affordable.' And I am saying that that is not necessarily a responsible position to take. We all have the same objective. We do not want these people left behind. We have made it clear that we want to bring them up to date. That is why we had the standard telephone service review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, I was hoping that from that I would get a steer on the true cost. If they had said to me, `Our best guess is that it will cost you a couple of hundred million dollars', you probably would have said, `Well, that is affordable in the scheme of things. Let's build it in.' But we did not get that. All that we got was advice that we should not impose unreasonable costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You then ask what it is really going to cost, and no&hyphen;one has any true idea&mdash;simply because, I suppose, the research has not been done. I do not have any problem about people doing the research and I do not want to remove any incentives from the carriers. I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> think it is perfectly respectable for us to conduct that review, despite what the carriers' inclinations might be, so we get an independent assessment of what is affordable and what is not. That way you then make a judgment about whether and how you get to the last four per cent. So it seems to me that that is the difference between us: you are saying `Hang the expense', and we are saying `No, let's do it in stages and see whether it is affordable at that point.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But we are also saying in our amendment that the ACA shall report each year on the progress being made. If we have the objective there and the ACA reports after each year and it is said that the carriers have made it quite clear that the technology to do this is going to cost us&mdash;as minister has just said&mdash;$2 billion, then the parliament can  have a look at that in 1998 or 1999 and make a subsequent change to the act. But I think that we ought to put it around the other way. The objective is there. We want the carriers to meet that objective, and they have to prove to us through these reviews by the ACA, which are covered by our amendment, that they cannot do it. Then the parliament can make an adjustment to the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is a situation which is the other way around. You want to drop back from the objective, to have a review some time before 2000 to see how they are going and if they cannot do it, as the objective is not there, I think they will be less dynamic in trying to get an outcome. But it is really a matter of which way you put the carrot or the stick. You might say that you are offering a bit more carrot, that they ought to achieve it. We are saying that the stick is there, and you have got to get there. But we are saying that the ACA will review this each year to report on progress. If the parliament gets reports from the ACA review, under our amendment, that this is technically not going to be achievable, the parliament will have to make a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1692"> judgment in 1999 that it is either going to have to find $2 billion through the USO to do it, as you say; or, extend the period. But we will have that debate closer to 2,000. I think that is not unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Four per cent on the number of subscribers&mdash;I thank your advisers for helping me on this calculation&mdash;is about 400,000, I suppose, on 10 million subscribers. Four hundred thousand subscribers who are in this 4 per cent is not an inconsiderable number; it is equivalent to the population of Tasmania. Senator Denman from Tasmania, who is behind me, nods her head. I am not in any way implying that all of Tasmania will be out of it, but across Australia the number of subscribers affected is equivalent to the population of Tasmania. So it is not a small number, even though 4 per cent does sound small.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I respond by saying that I think part of the problem that we would have with your approach is that you say, `Let's require them to get to 100 per cent by the year 2000.' Then, in the same breath, you say, `If they are having troubles, they will report back to us.' In other words, if at some stage you were satisfied that it was a serious problem you would have to come back and amend the legislation. In the meantime your amendment requires the minister, in exercising the powers conferred under section 63&mdash;which is to ensure that there is a licence condition requiring the carrier to provide this digital data capability to all people by the year 2000&mdash;to take all reasonable steps to ensure that that object is attained. If it is not, the ACA can cancel the carrier licence. That is a pretty 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> horrific last step. But the point is that that approach is fundamentally in conflict.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand, you are saying, `We are going to require you to do it and if you are having trouble, let us know and we will have a rethink.' On the other hand, the minister is saying, `By God, if you slow down at all, the ACA could take away your licence.' That is where the problem lies: you have got this inherent conflict of approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of a compromise solution, we would certainly be more than happy to bring forward the review, and I am amenable to any reasonable time frame for that. In other words, if you have got to 93.4 per cent by 1 July this year, there is no reason why we cannot be conducting this review over the next couple of years. But you do not want to do it immediately, because you will not learn any more than you know now. So you need a bit of a time period to elapse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I say that if we commenced the review or even concluded it by the end of 1998, you would be well placed to make a judgment about the most appropriate means of delivering services to the last 4 per cent. It may be that you can contract it out. It may be that you build it into the USO. It just seems to me that that is a more responsible approach to take than having the inherent tension between you saying, on the one hand, `I am imposing the obligation come what may, but if you have got problems come back and see us' and, on the other hand, the minister saying, `Just get on it with it; unless you do, you could lose your licence.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">If we can look at a form of words to amend that phrase, `reasonable accessible to all people in Australia', then I think we have a chance of a compromise. We know there will be a review. If the review is transparent and, in your own amendment, it comes to parliament to be debated, and that review says it is going to cost, in your terms, $2 billion to do this, that it is going to blow the USO calculations right through the roof, or you are going to have to find $2 billion somewhere else, or we are going to put up charges or whatever to pay for it&mdash;if all of those options are before the parliament then we have to make a choice about it. That means you make a choice in public process and you live or die by it, in a sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Reasonably accessible' is just too broad for us regarding the last four per cent&mdash;400,00. If you and your advisers can look at it, I would like some firmer definition to indicate that we are moving closer to get the 100 per cent. But, because we have the review process, if that is not working then parliament can reconsider it in 1998&hyphen;99 and make an amendment and we can have a transparent debate at that time.

It is not a semantic argument because we are really talking about whether or not it will become commercially available within that time frame.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I could indicate the government's attitude to those amendments. The real vice in that, and it is again part of this problem of doing things in the dark, is that it would require the minister to take all reasonable steps to ensure the undergrounding of existing and new cables takes place. In other words, again, irrespective of cost, you would have to have progressive retrospective undergrounding of all that is overhead in Australia at this time, but not power cables, which are just as, presumably, aesthetically offensive as telecommunications cables.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to us that that is entirely the wrong way to proceed. On any estimate you are talking about billions of dollars. In terms of priorities, it is still a very moot point whether the community at large would want to see billions of dollars spent on progressive undergrounding of cables rather than on new schools, hospitals and other community services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am by no means persuaded that there is universal outrage around Australia on this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1696"> issue. Indeed, the objection seems to have been loudest in some fairly concentrated areas. In my own area, for example, of Boroondara, where we were told that people were going to die in a ditch on the issue, the council has reached agreement with the carriers. In Ballarat, for example, an agreement was reached without a requirement for any moneys to be paid to the council. In other words, the council itself was very keen to have those services, and the ratepayers, presumably, are also just as keen, because there have been no objections that I am aware of. That tells you that it is, in many respects, a matter of varying judgments in different areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be leafy parts of the North Shore where this is a burning issue and where they may well be prepared to pay for the undergrounding of cables in their streets. But to require the minister to make it a licence condition that the carriers ensure the progressive retrospective undergrounding, irrespective of costs, seems to us to be very irresponsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our approach is rather to have a full assessment of the options and to get an independent assessment of the true cost of undergrounding all cables. We have already announced that we are establishing a working group to examine the issues involved in putting all cables underground.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They will probably play a bit better. I should not say that because they did do better the other night, thank heavens. The working group will be a very representative one: each of the states and territories will be represented on it, as will be the Australian Local Government Association. It seems to us that that is the way to progress this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not want to run away from the fact that it would be desirable in principle but, once again, you simply cannot ignore the true cost of such an activity. It is critically important to know who should be paying that cost. We have already got a commitment from 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Telstra to put $1 million on the table and $&half; million from Optus. We therefore have the capacity to conduct some high-level independent research to determine what the true cost would be. I think everyone on the working group would be very interested in exploring the possibilities of undergrounding power and telecommunications cables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then you have to look at what I think is just as difficult an issue, and that is in what proportions you would expect the various stakeholders to contribute to such an exercise. It is very difficult to say that, just because you live on the North Shore, you should be subsidised by everyone else in the country; it is equally difficult to confine the true cost of undergrounding to residents in those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our approach is not to ignore the issue at all but to address it in a systematic fashion, to establish a working group, to acknowledge that it is going to take time to come to grips with what are very vexed economic issues in terms of cost and sharing of cost and then to report back so that the parliament is made fully aware of all of the implications. The parliament can then proceed to look at the best way of addressing the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrat series of amendments would simply say that this is going to happen irrespective. You are going to commit the same offence, in our judgment, as you would have wanted to commit probably 12 months ago and that was to effectively impose very substantial burdens on carriers who have built business cases against the background of a legislative regime that allowed them to roll that out and did not impose any obligation to then bear the cost of progressive undergrounding. You are proposing now that that additional burden should be imposed on presumably all carriers. That would fundamentally affect the economics of the roll-out to the point where you might make it totally uneconomic for any of the carriers to remain in the business, and I do not think any of us would want to see that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make it abundantly clear that this would be a disastrous outcome not only for carriers and potential users of their services but ultimately, I would have thought, for the Australian community in terms of priorities. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1697"> The more appropriate way of proceeding is as I have indicated and as will be addressed in government amendments Nos 250, 251 and 252. They require cabling to be removed when all other aerial cabling has already been removed unless otherwise agreed with the relevant local government authority; they require a review to be undertaken of the options; and they require the ACA to monitor progress in placing cabling underground. The report of the working group will be provided to the parliament by 1 July 1998.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, the Democrats have moved amendment No. 1 and then Nos 7 to 12. As I understand it, Democrat amendment No. 1 is adding to the list of objectives on pages 2 and 3 of the Telecommunications Bill. I think the amendment should actually be (h) rather than (g) because (g) is already there. I do not think you are asking (g) to be deleted. Nevertheless, whatever the correct alphabet number is, the amendment says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to promote the relocation of existing overhead cables, and the location of future cables, underground wherever possible.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I presume that, when they talk about `cables', they are talking about telecommunications cables. When you look at the list of other objects in clause (3) of the bill, you have a whole list of things which start with `to promote'. For example:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to promote the supply of diverse and innovative carriage services and content services;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to promote the development of an Australian telecommunications industry that is efficient, competitive and responsive to the needs of the Australian community . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Also (d) starts off `to promote'; (e) is `to promote'; (f) is `to promote'; and the existing (g) is `to promote'. These are not binding formulas to say you have to spend X amount of money that goes on each of these things. This is the objective of the bill. I believe it is not unreasonable to include Democrat amendment No. 1 in the list which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to promote the relocation of existing overhead cables, and the location of future cables, underground wherever possible.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that is a reasonable thing to promote. That is separate from the arguments you may

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition can live with an additional clause in the objectives starting off `to promote' because it does give a guidance, an impetus, an indication to the community that this is what we should all be about. I do not think anybody has any objection to putting these goddamned cables underground over a longer period of time. If we can do it at the same time as convincing electricity authorities to do it, the urban landscape of Australia and so on that we all know will be immeasurably improved. I ask you: what is wrong with Democrat amendment No. 1 itself being added into the objectives?</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That may not be a desirable end objective. That is what I am saying to you. If you just take those words at face value I think you are quite correct in saying that it is not confined to telecommunications cables. There is no definition there. It could well be all forms of cable and, particularly, it could be telecommunications cables which people in rural areas are perfectly happy to see above ground. In many instances the complaint you get when you talk about mobile telephony is quite the opposite of what Senator Allison would find on the leafy shores of south Melbourne. They are saying, `By hook or by crook we want an overhead tower so we can get a decent digital service out in the bush.' In the same way they would regard it as being very low on their priorities to suddenly find cables throughout the country on highways and byways being put underground.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you are not doing justice to words if you say that you can have some sort of harmless objects clause that promotes undergrounding wherever possible and not acknowledge that that would then obligate people to implement it wherever possible&mdash;and that is irrespective of cost. Saying `wherever possible' is not saying `as long as it is not unaffordable'; it is saying it has to be done wherever possible. We know it is possible, technically speaking, to do it now. The sticking point is cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might like to start again and say, `Wouldn't it be wonderful if everything had gone underground in the first instance.' I could not disagree with that if that had been the way it had happened. If you had not got Kim Beazley to change the Telecommunications Act in 1991 to allow powers and immunities to continue over a period of years we may have had a very different configuration in this country. But we haven't; we have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what is there and we have to address the true cost and desirability of changing that, and particularly undergrounding it which is clearly going to be a multibillion dollar exercise. I think it would be quite irresponsible to say, `Let's have it as an objective to underground that,' knowing it is going to cost billions of dollars, and not at the same time expect people to be doing something about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot have an objects clause that is not requiring anyone to implement it. If you are going to have an objects clause then, consistent with the logic, you have got to have an act that delivers the goods. That is certainly not the way to go. It is much more sensible to take first things first: find out what the true cost is, have a sensible political debate about whether that is affordable and whether it should be done in certain areas&mdash;whether the people on the North Shore of Sydney and in a few other places who are particularly keen on it might not like to have arrangements that enabled that to occur&mdash;or whether it is a national objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I keep saying that I would have thought that in the scheme of things there are many more important ways in which you could spend scarce taxpayers' money than spending many billions of dollars undergrounding cable. Let us at least get an idea of what it costs and an idea of how cost sharing ought to be arranged; and then look at where we go.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is interesting that the minister talks about the need for us to know what the cost is when this working group that was first mooted six months ago has still to be set up. I think this is why the Australian Democrats are driven to move these amendments. It is because there has been such inadequate progress on the part of the government in responding to enormous concern out there in the community&mdash;and also a concern in local government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fact that the Australian Local Government Association has encouraged us so strongly to move these amendments because they see a complete lack of any sort of commitment by the government on this issue. We can take the case of Telstra. Where it has had the capacity to take its cables underground&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1699"> which certainly would not cost billions of dollars, may take a little longer and may be slightly more expensive&mdash;Telstra has not done that. The minister stood by and allowed that to happen. So what we are asking for is an indication from the minister that the government will promote the relocation of existing overhead cables and the location of future cables underground where possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were hoping that this would set a direction for the government to respond to the huge numbers of people who have written to my office and spoken with me directly&mdash;and no doubt have done this to most other senators in this place. Unless we have a referendum on this subject I do not believe, Minister, that you can stand up and say that there is not a wish for the government to have a greater commitment to promoting the undergrounding of both TV cabling and other sorts of cabling. As Senator Schacht points out, these amendments are not binding; they are not requiring that billions of dollars be spent on this. They are simply asking for a stronger commitment on the part of the government to see that it happens, not immediately but wherever and whenever possible.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just respond to that so we do not proceed on a false basis. I think it is quite disingenuous to suggest that the Democrats are now driven to require undergrounding wherever possible because of the delay in the establishment of the working group. The fact is the Democrats have been determined to veto the existing roll-out for at least the last couple of years. They have never shown the slightest interest in compromising. Their attitude from day one has been that the roll-out should stop immediately and everything should go underground.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to be clear on this, Senator Allison said she thought people would wish to see the government provide greater commitment to undergrounding. That is precisely why we are establishing the working group to explore what the implications of it would be. She says that it might take a little longer and it might have been slightly more expensive. I am sure she knows, because there have been Austel 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reports on the subject, that the very reason that both companies wanted to go overhead&mdash;Optus much more than Telstra, but Telstra by way of catch&hyphen;up&mdash;was that it was something like three of four times cheaper and two or three times faster. It makes a huge difference, and they were allowed to do that by the 1991 act.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> They have already spent billions of dollars acting in good faith in accordance with the legislative framework that was enacted. You have always taken the view that that did not matter, that you ought to be able to stop it cold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem once again with saying, `Why don't we just have an objects clause,' is that you also have an amendment that would require the minister, in exercising powers conferred under the act, to take all reasonable steps to ensure that your objects were attained. In other words, once you start putting an objects clause in that promotes the relocation of existing overhead cables and future cables underground wherever possible, then you are also putting an obligation on the minister, or the government, to ensure that it happens, once again, irrespective of cost and irrespective of the consequences for the carriers. That is precisely why we say that that would be quite irresponsible.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For a start, the Democrats have never said that we would veto TV cabling. It is quite wrong of the minister to say that. We have never said that we would stop it cold. Our position has always been that the matter of TV cabling and mobile phone towers ought to be something that local government could put through normal planning processes, and that is still our position. We have never, at any stage, talked in terms of vetoing anything. I take exception to the fact that the minister continues to say that when that has not been our position at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would ask the minister why it is that this working group has taken so long. We had this commitment from Telstra and Optus some months ago.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the answer to that is that it is important that it be part of the legislative program. We wanted to have that obligation inserted in the act. We have already done a lot of the preparatory work. It has been necessary to have extensive discussions with the states to determine whether they want to be simply represented as a group or as individual states and territories. We have needed to ensure that this process is fully thought through before it is put into place. After all, no-one pretends that you will be able to achieve this over a short time frame of a couple of years. It has to be an ongoing strategy. There are states which are already going down this path by entering into arrangements with local government authorities, but still setting a 10- to 15-year timetable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the scheme of things, I would have thought that it was perfectly sensible to have tried to get the process right.

So it is not as if it is simply rolling on. We were never prepared to bring that date  forward, for obvious reasons. So nothing is happening that would have been affected by the working group being established even six months ago.

It should not be overturned by the politicians in Canberra, but given a chance to be made to work in the way it was intended.

<PARA STYLE="Para">The central question here is choice, option and the right of all citizens to make their own deliberation in the matter of dying when they are terminally ill. For that small number of the dying in our society who find themselves suffering without relief, in pain without cure and suffering indignity without alleviation, the central question I ask of senators is this: how can you take away their right to opt for voluntary euthanasia when, as intelligent citizens, their hands reach out to ask for assistance of other mature citizens? What right have we to deny them that choice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS> which contains the first survey of doctors involved in dying has been much disputed. But one of the things it rings with is the reality that each year thousands of Australians die earlier because their physicians have determined that they will help them to do so. The figures from that medical journal study indicate that in Australia some 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1702"> 4,400 people per annum die with their doctors actively assisting their death. But the problem is that it is without consultation with those people because our law as it stands inherently forbids it. That is the interpretation of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this debate the choice for those who support the bill is not whether you can stop euthanasia: it is whether you keep it covert, with citizens denied the determination; and whether you are going to leave it with their medical attendants, their doctors, who are themselves inhibited from discussing the matter with the patients because inherently the law could catch up with them and have them charged with murder or worse, if they were to say exactly what they were contemplating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I submit, as many legal authorities do, that we as a mature society can do better than that. In this, the people and the legislature of the Northern Territory have shown the way. Let me quote from Dr Margaret Otlowski, senior lecturer in law at the University of Tasmania. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current legal situation is totally unsatisfactory in that it creates very real dangers for both doctors and patients: doctors are at risk of criminal liability for murder (or assisting suicide) if their conduct is exposed; the rights and interests of patients are vulnerable, particularly in the light of recent evidence indicating a relative high incidence in Australia (in comparison with the Netherlands) of killings of patients occurring other than at the patient's request. It is my submission that the most effective way to protect the rights and interests of both doctors and patients is by acknowledging the existence of the practice of euthanasia and seeking to regulate it in carefully controlled circumstances. The legislation in the Northern Territory represents a very cautious attempt to legalise active assistance in dying, subject to stringent safeguards. The legal framework it establishes is sound and provides ample protection for doctors and patients.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Add to that the words of David Kelly, former chairman of the Law Reform Commission of Victoria. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the common law focuses on the care of the living patient&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is the law as we have it now&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it in fact permits a doctor to assist a patient to die in most of the cases covered by the Northern Territory Act. It also permits a doctor to assist a terminally ill patient to die in a number of circumstances <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">not</EMPHASIS>  covered by that Act. It offers much <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">less</EMPHASIS>  protection against abuse that the Act does. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, in effect, by supporting the Andrews' bill we are moving, according to that legal authority, to a situation in which the person is less protected than under the Northern Territory law which at least codifies the process of voluntary euthanasia and brings it into a set of rules which are understood by all, and which offer protection to both doctors and their patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is because of the debate about this matter that public opinion has moved in Australia. Let us not deny this in the Senate: the majority of Australians in every poll since the 1960s have supported voluntary euthanasia as the right of citizens, as an option that citizens should have. One only has to see both the repeated opinion poll figures and the way in which they have strengthened over those two or three decades to recognise that this is a constant as far as the Australian people are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A Morgan poll back in 1962 showed that 47 per cent of people supported voluntary euthanasia which a patient had asked for, compared to 39 per cent who opposed it. Within 33 years&mdash;in 1995&mdash;the same question put to the Australian people showed that the support had grown to 78 per cent and the opposition had fallen to 14 per cent. So in circumstances where a person asks to die and doctor is able to respond with a lethal injection, 78 per cent of people&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Herron asked `What were the questions?' Last night he indicated, as did other speakers, that these questions did not talk about the specifics of euthanasia as in the Northern Territory. These polls asked about a doctor injecting `with a lethal dose' at the request of a person. Australians say yes to that&mdash;78 per cent to 14 per cent. A recent Newspoll showed a 63 to 28 majority on the same question. That is why I believe Australians have a right to express themselves on this matter. It should not just be left to parliamentarians. I therefore foreshadow an amendment I wish to move to the motion before the Senate. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I do so because I believe the people have a right to have a say in the matter. I do so because I believe that the House of Representatives did not reflect the feeling of the people of Australia. I do so because I believe every Australian has a right to have a say in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is a matter of conscience&mdash;as we repeatedly hear in this place&mdash;let it be on the conscience of the Australian people. Let them express their feelings in the matter. Let them say how they feel in this matter which is pertinent to every one of us 18 million Australians because all of us recognise that sooner or later death will come our way as part of the relay of life, as we hand on to others the great gift of life that we have ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the matter of religion I want to say this: I believe in a universal life force which gives us that relay of life, passing on from generation to generation, an essential factor being death. It also gives us intelligence, sensitivity, rights and responsibilities. That is my God. And so it is for me to choose about voluntary euthanasia when I am dying and life has been overtaken by the matter of how to die. My God says that is my choice. Others in this place may have a God who does not give them that choice. Well and good. Abide by your God, but do not force your God on me and I will not force my God on you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this great debate we are challenged to back the people of the Northern Territory; we are challenged to back the breakthrough for the whole world which their courage in this legislation, brought forward by Marshall Perron, has given to the world. We are inveighed to back the vote that was carried three times in the Northern Territory Assembly, and which has shown clearly that assembly's commitment to this legislation, backed by the majority of Northern Territorians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot pass without saying that I see the parallels here with the controversial legislation of the New Zealand and South Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parliaments 100 years ago when they gave the vote to women; or with the even earlier legislation in the British Parliament, controversial, howled down by many people in society, which gave children the right to education instead of being placed in workhouses and in mines. Also, there is a parallel with the legislation which led to a civil war in the United States which, nevertheless, at the end of that controversy, gave freedom to people who before faced nothing but slavery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about human rights; it is about individual rights and we are challenged in this Senate, as a house of review, and a house of the states, to look differently at what I believe was an aberrant vote and a non&hyphen;reflective vote, as far as the Australian people were concerned, for the Andrews' bill. We should overturn it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I can do little better than quote from Wes Lanhupuy, the Northern Territorian who had the casting vote with the original legislation back in 1995. This former member for Arnhem said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After all the debate and controversy, I said to people that I hoped that they would be able to give me the right to exercise my right as an individual. It is not hard to ask for a person's rights as an individual. A man lives his life, whether for or against the law, and irrespective of whether he has received the rights that he has demanded or has had a cheerful life or otherwise. When he is about to make his last request, should we be in a position to deny him that last right which he wants? That is the question which I believe honourable members of this House will have to come to grips with by themselves. . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">With no less charge, we in this Senate are challenged to give people that right, and not to deny it to them. We are charged to have the courage of the Northern Territory legislators. We are charged to respond to the undeniable force of public opinion in this country, and I charge all senators who have not yet made up their minds in this matter to think carefully about that preponderant public opinion&mdash;to give the people a say if you cannot make a decision against overriding this legislation, which will set the clock back decades in what is an inexorable move in the global community as well as here in Australia towards granting everybody the right to opt for voluntary euthanasia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Euthanasia Laws Bill, the purpose of which is to stop the killing of Australians in territory hospitals. Euthanasia is the premeditated act of delivering or facilitating a lethal injection with the purpose of ending life. Neither this bill nor the Northern Territory bill is concerned with the withdrawal of life support systems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under euthanasia, a person does not die naturally. Without this bill before the Senate, already passed by a large majority in the House of Representatives, Australians will continue to be put to death and the value of life will incrementally diminish for all of us. Without this bill, the Northern Territory Attorney&hyphen;General will table a euthanasia report at the end of each financial year, tabulating in some form the deaths by lethal injection. As the report is handed down, will anyone be heard to cry, `Hear, hear!'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this parliament we have many reports tabled every sitting day. The time to discuss them is small. Some are weighty and others insignificant in the affairs of the state. But should we allow euthanasia to continue by defeating the bill before us then this Senate will have effectively signed and postdated every euthanasia report to be tabled in the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory as surely as if we were party to the killings detailed therein.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate we are having here today is of the greatest consequence for our society and those societies which take their lead from us. It is of the greatest consequence because it is about the value we attach to life, not just as fathers and mothers, husbands and wives, but as elected leaders with national and international responsibilities. It is of the greatest consequence, because the state has revisited its power to kill. By enacting a law which permits the killing of a person or by refusing to enact a law which prohibits it, the state is responsible for that death. The buck stops with us here today. It used to be a state's right to kill, but over the years the ability of nation states to exercise that right  has gradually been removed&mdash;most notably in resiling 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from capital punishment. If the state revisits its power to kill, the danger is that the state assumes once more the right to kill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second half of this century, the Australian state has been about increasing the value attached to the lives of  its citizens. Overall, great and largely successful efforts have been put into increasing our quality and standard of living, not least by advances in medical research. We value life very highly in Australia, as attested to by the French yachtsman Thierry Dubois, on his amazing rescue from the Southern Ocean earlier this year. He marvelled that we could go to such lengths to save one life&mdash;and that life not even one of our own citizens. Did we marvel so much? No. Proud? Yes. But were we surprised at the efforts put in by the armed services? No, because it is an ingrained trait for Australians to go to the last lengths to face any adversity to preserve a life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Think only of the generosity we show to poorer countries with insufficient food and racked by disease. Think of the rush to aid those affected by international disasters and the courage and sacrifice made by our citizens overseas to assist. Think of the risks taken by our peacekeepers in lands where blood flows freely. Think of the great mountains of wheat grown on our plains&mdash;wheat that has been transported to starving mouths across the world. We are a country dedicated to life like no other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the penultimate moment of being swallowed by the seas, Thierry Dubois was given his first taste of a universal, life&hyphen;affirming mateship. Today, we are considering whether euthanasia fits into the continuity of that Australian spirit. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They say that the numbers are close, that this bill to defeat euthanasia will be decided by a handful of votes. This means that each senator's vote now carries greater significance and, as the count draws ever faster towards its decisive conclusion, that the burden on each conscience is heavier. In whose hands will the responsibility rest for tipping the scales one way or the other? It will not lie in the hands of the devout Christians, nor in the hands of the committed euthanasia supporter. Those votes are already in. We may never know the identity of those 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1705"> who will come to assume the role of Solomon on the fate of this bill before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I would like to think&mdash;and I am sure the country would like to think&mdash;that they will have some of the following characteristics: the quality of mateship, prepared to forsake selfish interests to right a wrong or rescue a life; a prejudice, like Mary MacKillop, in favour of the poor and disadvantaged&mdash;who the Senate committee has heard would be most at risk under a euthanasia regime; and, like Mary MacKillop, a persistence to overcome tyrannical rules which stand in the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would hope this group of senators might have the figurative hands of Weary Dunlop, dedicated to healing and encouraging; and the approach to life in adversity as passed down to us from our folk heroes and best summarised as `fight and never surrender'. We would admire them if they applauded the primacy of the urge to work to save mankind from terrible diseases, as exemplified by our Nobel Prize winners for medicine&mdash;Eccles, Florey and Doherty. How many Australians are alive today because of their motivation to use all their talents to improve life?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know they would salute the selflessness of our humble priests and missionaries who found their vocation in neighbouring islands, embracing the life that was in incurable leprosy victims rather than embracing a means to their death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know from the House of Lords committee that involuntary euthanasia cannot be ruled out, that lives will be taken without the required permission, that there is no absolute safeguard that every person who dies of lethal injection voluntarily does so without pressure or without feeling the compulsion to self&hyphen;sacrifice to ease their family's burdens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, will the senators who decide the outcome of this debate have the same determination to save innocent, vulnerable victims from an undeserved and unwanted fate, as the saviours of Lindy Chamberlain had to free her?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that we all believe that Australia, despite our shortcomings, is at the forefront of the whole world in the equitable treatment 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of our people, no matter what their colour, gender, creed, age, health or wealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How will these special senators, carrying the power of life and death in their hands, assess the compatibility of euthanasia with the need to set an international example of how we treat our vulnerable, indigenous, sick and elderly?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a society such as ours to consider euthanasia, invites the world's scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we take the next step and defeat this bill, we not only stamp the visa for euthanasia to enter mainstream Australian life, but we also invite the rest of the world to reciprocate. If we say to China and Burma on the one hand that they must copy us on human rights, will we also be so proud of our record on euthanasia that we ask them to copy that as well? If we cannot be proud of something, if we cannot boast to the world of the decisions we make in this parliament, then we should decide the other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You see, I think the Northern Territory made an error of fact in their decision on euthanasia. They forgot what a beacon we are to the world on the value of life. They did not see our greatness. They were too humble in reflecting on the impact of their little bill and too introspective to see what other, less democratic and less respectful&hyphen;of&hyphen;life countries might make of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should history change? Tyrannical regimes are ever anxious for weaker sanctions on the taking of life, ever anxious for tools of fear to oppress minorities and political opponents. If the country that goes around preaching human rights to them says euthanasia's okay, then who is to say it is not? The world will have lost a leader on the side of the angels, which it can ill&hyphen;afford to lose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Euthanasia could be the answer to many questions in the developing world. It will take on an appearance different to its sanitised, sophisticated, computer&hyphen;mechanised delivery in the developed western world. Its face would not be recognisable as that which is happening right now in the Northern Territory, but they would share a common ancestry. Is this Senate prepared to be mother and father to even the slightest weakening of the globe's sanctions against intentional killing? 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1706"> What message do we send if we, the self&hyphen;styled leaders of justice and tolerance and democracy, take specific action to devalue that high standard of life?</PARA>

It is time to stop being coy about our national identity, and say without hesitation that we are for life, in all its richness, pain, mystery, confusion and diversity. That small group of senators who decide the fate of the Euthanasia Laws Bill before us can look to many precepts in history to guide them. They might remember the motivation of Egypt's Anwar El&hyphen;Sadat in his courageous visit to the Israeli parliament because he wanted to further the `sublime position of mankind.' How does euthanasia rate by this yardstick?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of a right to autonomy is frequently raised by those in favour of euthanasia, but perhaps the senators with the casting votes might question the real nature of liberty, as did the influential American jurist, Judge Learned Hand, in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And what is this liberty which must lie in the hearts of men and women? It is not the ruthless, the unbridled will; it is not the freedom to do as one likes. That is the denial of liberty and leads straight to its overthrow.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Will these senators think along Winston Churchill lines that our primary objective is to stand up for the `survival for the urge, the impulse of the ages, that mankind shall move forward towards his goal'? Will they decide that euthanasia moves us on towards that goal?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Euthanasia has been described by Australian palliative care experts as a `violent solution'. Louis Pasteur could have been speaking of euthanasia when he described the two contrary laws which:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset of my contribution, let me say that I had a very large number of representations on the issue of euthanasia. I have received over 1,300 letters representing the full range of opinion on the bill, although I do think it is proper for me to make it clear to the Senate that the vast majority of those correspondents have supported passage of the Euthanasia Laws Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I have responded to each of these letters, I do want to take this opportunity to again thank those who have written for taking the time and the trouble to put their views in writing to me. The correspondence that I have received on this issue has given me a much better understanding of community views on this matter and has certainly assisted me in refining my own views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Deputy President, all of the representations that I have received have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> strengthened my conviction that, because views about euthanasia vary so much and are so deeply held, decisions on this matter made by parliament should be made on the basis of individual conscience rather than of party affiliation. I have been a strong proponent of this approach within the Australian Labor Party where I have argued that a conscience vote should apply both on the procedural handling of this bill and in speaking and voting on the bill itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If enacted, the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996 will remove the legislative power of the Australian Capital Territory, Norfolk Island and the Northern Territory to enact laws that permit voluntary or involuntary euthanasia. In particular, the bill will override the Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 which, under certain conditions, permits physician assisted suicide and active voluntary euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate, as I see it, is fundamentally about an individual's right to choose. This is not to say that there are not many other issues involved, nor does it deny the importance of those issues. I appreciate, for example, the strength of the religious convictions that many people hold about the sanctity of life. I acknowledge the concerns about the potential erosion of medical ethics. I accept that there are legal uncertainties. And, of course, there is an issue of territory rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But for me the overriding principle is that of individual freedom of choice. I believe that we should not deny that freedom to those who are suffering from a terminal illness and may choose death as an alternative to insufferable pain. I feel strong sympathy with the aim of the Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act which this legislation before us seeks to overturn. That aim, in Marshall Perron's words, is to give:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those who suffer the right to choose a death with dignity, to bring an end to the torture many endure on their death bed, and for that to be done legally, without fear of prosecution for those doctors or nurses who may assist a patient in this desire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Deputy President, in addition to recognising this right, it also provides individuals with choice, with the option of awaiting an inevitable death in pain or of choosing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1708"> euthanasia as a means to ending their suffering. The provisions of the act ensure that the choice is exercised exclusively by the patient and there is nothing in the act that obliges anyone to take up the option of euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Rights of the Terminally Ill Act is clearly, in my view, within the competence of the Northern Territory legislature and does not infringe on the Northern Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act. I do not believe that we should legislate to overturn it and accordingly I will be voting against this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Deputy President, it is a reality that euthanasia in various forms happens now. It is a reality that we neither can nor should ignore. The evidence before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's inquiry into this bill was conclusive in this regard. As indicated in the committee's report, a survey of New South Wales and ACT doctors conducted in 1994 by Professor Peter Baume and Emma O'Malley found that 47 per cent of doctors had been asked by a patient to hasten his or her death and 28 per cent had taken active steps to bring about the death of a patient who had asked them to do so. Of these, 81 per cent had done so more than once, 93 per cent still thought that they had done the right thing, 58 per cent thought that the law should be changed to permit active voluntary euthanasia and 46 per cent thought that the law should be changed to permit physician assisted suicide. I am aware that other surveys have yielded similar results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not argue that we should legislate to legalise an activity just because it is prevalent, but when that activity is benign, even in this case when it is merciful and purely a matter of personal choice, I think the fact of its prevalence does become an argument in favour of legislation. The people of the Northern Territory, through their elected representatives, have taken the decision to legalise euthanasia. I believe that decision is reasonable, is justified and I certainly do not see any justification for this parliament to impose a contrary view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also persuaded by the argument that the continued prohibition of voluntary euthanasia, coupled with its prevalence, does not permit proper control and scrutiny. Again, I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> agree with Marshall Perron, whom the committee report quotes as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is surely preferable to have voluntary euthanasia tolerated in particular circumstances, with stringent safeguards and a degree of transparency, than to continue to prohibit it officially while allowing it to be carried out in secret without any controls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the important issue of consent. Evidence given to the Senate committee reveals quite clearly that many end of life decisions, such as those to withdraw or withhold life sustaining treatment, or to administer life shortening pain and symptom control, are currently taken without the consent of the patient. I strongly believe it is preferable that those who find themselves in this situation have the option to make their own end of life decisions. This argument was put persuasively by a Northern Territory nurse, who is quoted in the additional comments made by my colleagues Senator McKiernan and Senator Bolkus in the Senate report. She said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My name is Sue Carter. I am a registered nurse. I am speaking tonight on a couple of points that come from my experience in nursing. The first point I want to make is that people make the comment that palliative care works and that doctors and nurses sort things out for patients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem with that is that no&hyphen;one consults the patient in the ward about what is about to happen. What happens is that there is a discussion between nurses and doctors generally and a decision is made to "up the morphine", as the comment is. No&hyphen;one actually goes to the patient and says, "Look, Mr Jones, you're really suffering here; we are going to up this morphine. The end result of that will be that you will lapse into unconsciousness, we cannot say when, and eventually you will die." Nobody tells them that. So they are not giving their consent to the sort of activity that occurs at the moment, whereas voluntary euthanasia enables the patient to have control, enables them to talk to their families and to make an exit at a time that suits them.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For that reason, I support it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I will be listening to this debate to hear a convincing rebuttal of the argument that Ms Sue Carter puts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is appropriate that we as parliamentarians take account of community views, particularly when we are dealing with important social issues. It would be foolish of any legislature to seek to impose a social measure or standard of behaviour which was supported 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1709"> by only a small minority of voters, a small minority of the community. The majority would certainly make their views clear at the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of euthanasia, it appears that the Northern Territory parliament, in legislating to allow it, was reflecting a very substantial majority of the electorate. It also appears that if we were to support the Euthanasia Laws Bill and override the decision of the Northern Territory legislature, we would be taking action that was supported by only a minority of the community. To cite just a few examples of public opinion polling on this subject which were highlighted in the Senate committee's report: a Morgan poll found in June 1995 that 78 per cent of respondents were in favour of voluntary euthanasia; a Newspoll found in July 1996 that 75 per cent were in favour of the practice. Since 1962, when the first Morgan poll on euthanasia was conducted, there has been a consistent and growing majority in favour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any discussion of euthanasia brings with it the need to address the issue of palliative care. It is something that has been raised in submissions and evidence before the Senate committee time and time again. Palliative care is critical in the treatment of people suffering terminal illness and, regardless of whether or not they support euthanasia as an option, palliative care must be available to them. I do not believe that any of us would try to stand up here and say that there is sufficient funding for palliative care in Australia today, either for research, training or the provision of care. I hope that the review which is currently being conducted by the Department of Health and Family Services will facilitate some positive change in this area, along with adequate funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government recognised the need to provide support for palliative care by providing funding in the 1993&hyphen;94 budget to the states and territories for a four&hyphen;year program to the value of $55 million. Funds were also allocated under schedule G of the Medicare agreements and through the HACC program. I regret that the current government has cut this funding but I do hope that this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> debate will facilitate a bipartisan commitment to funding palliative care in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I come back to the fact that what we are debating here is the right of the individual facing pain&mdash;extreme pain&mdash;and certain death to determine the time and the manner of their own death. I recognise that right and I remind those who do not of the words of Mr Bob Dent, the first person to utilise the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. In his letter published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> shortly after his death, he said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you disagree with voluntary euthanasia, then don't use it, but don't deny me the right to use it if and when I want to.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Northern Territory parliament has recognised this right. In doing so, I think it has responded to community views and the widespread prevalence of the practice of euthanasia, often in ways that currently deny choice to the patient. I believe it would be wrong of us to override the decision of the Northern Territory legislators on this issue and wrong of us to deny those who may wish to make use of the legislation the choice as to how and when they end their own lives. Accordingly, Mr Acting Deputy President, I will be voting against the Euthanasia Laws Bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I am proud to be the only leader of a parliamentary party who is opposing this bill. For the record, six of my colleagues will also vote against Mr Andrews' bill, and Senator John Woodley will support it. Like coalition and Labor senators, our seven Democrat senators have a conscience vote on this bill and, like so many of you, we too have had to agree to disagree as we have struggled to come to terms with what is a difficult and complex issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe very strongly that voluntary euthanasia is a matter in which there is no clear right or wrong, and no clear black or white. Instead I think there are shades of grey and degrees of personal belief and personal experience and most of us can only do our best to come to terms with those. That is why I do not think there is anything to be gained from playing politics with this issue, and there 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1710"> is nothing to be gained from any of the opponents or the supporters of Mr Andrews' bill trying to stake out the moral high ground in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is because I regard voluntary euthanasia as such a deeply personal and individual matter that I feel intensely uncomfortable about being a part of a group of politicians, a small and not particularly representative group of Australians at that, making a decision with such potentially dramatic personal implications. It seems to me to be a very fundamental infringement upon the beliefs, both religious and personal, of others to have a handful of people denying fellow Australians, particularly those who are dying and wish to avail themselves of this opportunity, such an opportunity to choose a swift and dignified death if they so wish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that there is inherent nobility in pain and suffering. I believe we each have our own thresholds, our own limits, our own fears and our own terrors. At the heart of my opposition to this bill lies my belief that I cannot and should not sit in judgment on the limits, fears and beliefs of others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, I am a Christian, although whether I leave this place with any faith after some of the budgets and legislation that we debate in this place is a matter of some concern to me, but as a Christian I acknowledge the difference of opinion about life and death both within the Christian tradition and within other religions. Some people believe life itself is sacred and should be preserved at any cost; others place quality of life ahead of life itself. But holding a particular set of beliefs does not entitle me to impose those beliefs upon others. It does not entitle me to presume that others share my beliefs. Perhaps, most importantly in the context of this debate, I should not delude myself that people's religious or moral beliefs will be changed by legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe the introduction of a bill which removes the power of the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island to make laws permitting euthanasia will stop euthanasia from taking place. It will not stop euthanasia&mdash;either active or passive&mdash;from taking place for one 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very simple reason: most Australians believe the right to decide how and when to die is an integral part of their freedom, their dignity and their autonomy as an individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to the crunch, most people want to be able to exercise that right and many will&mdash;when their personal limits are reached and even if the very best palliative care is available to them&mdash;ask someone. They will ask a relative, a friend or their medical practitioner to help them die. Unless we are asking governments to use this bill to go storm&hyphen;trooping through the hospitals, the hospices and people's homes, arresting doctors and their patients, then the only value this bill has is that it forces doctors and their patients back over that border between legal and illegal behaviour and back into a world of secret actions, lies and deceit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe some senators do want governments to intervene more actively to stop all forms of euthanasia, but I do not believe such a level of interference in these sorts of personal and private decisions is something the vast majority of Australians would support. I think we have to recognise that active voluntary euthanasia is already practised in Australia and that current legal prohibitions do not, and will not, stop some patients asking for help and some doctors from giving that help. It is surely better to have the practice of active voluntary euthanasia out in the open, properly regulated and scrutinised&mdash;instead of the secretive and clandestine manner in which it is currently approached.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will see. In my view, openness and accountability are the best ways to protect patients from abuse. I also think it is important to note that the Northern Territory legislation is not a carte blanche for euthanasia. It does not compel you to take the opportunity. It is strictly limited to providing a framework for active voluntary euthanasia and it does not extend&mdash;despite all the emotive words that are used about doctors of death and lethal injections&mdash;to actions taken without a patient's consent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the legal clarity of the Northern Territory legislation stands in marked contrast to the imprecision and uncertainty of Mr Andrews' bill. There is no consensus on what exactly the Andrews' bill does or does not do in relation to its attempt to take away the Northern Territory's power to make certain laws. There also have been doubts expressed about whether the bill will not also effectively restrict the territory's power to enact laws covering the right to refuse treatment, guardianship, medical powers of attorney and certain passive euthanasia practices. In short, I think you can argue that the supporters of Mr Andrews' bill are replacing a clear and limited piece of legislation with an unclear one&mdash;one which will create even more uncertainty in an already uncertain area while still failing to prevent the practices it purports to prohibit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of people are using the states rights argument. I am not a strong defender of states rights; I believe people have rights, not states. The Democrats have always held the view that the national parliament should not be coy about overriding the states and territories in matters of national interest. Many is the time when we have asked for that to happen on environmental issues, for example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason, while I have concerns about the appropriateness of the use of a private member's bill in this manner, I do not agree with the view that a state or territory should be able to do anything they like and `damn the national consequences'. I do understand how Northern Territorians feel, but I cannot be a hypocrite by saying that this is the reason I am voting against this bill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I do find it extraordinary to hear the views of some members of the Liberal and National parties on this particular aspect. It seems to be a case of when you agree with what a state is doing, then you scream or you champion states rights; but when you do not like what they are up to, then you find a nice, expedient reason to back legislation overriding that state or territory's rights. All I can say is that, after this debate is over, we should never ever have to listen to another lecture on the topic of states rights from those coalition members who use this particular reason to justify their position on the Andrews' bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have great difficulty understanding how members of the Liberal Party who champion freedom of the individual and for whom the rhetoric of choice underpins just about all of the legislation we have seen introduced since this government came to power last year, can deny those very things to individuals on this matter. It seems to me to be extremely hypocritical to say, `These are the things I believe in but not on this matter.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> At the end of the day, I can only say that my personal beliefs coincide with the underlying premise of the Northern Territory legislation: that a competent adult suffering from a terminal illness may request his or her medical practitioner to assist in terminating his or her life. I do not believe that anyone&mdash;or any parliament&mdash;should deny that right to a terminally ill person. I know that many Australians also agree with that premise. It was interesting to see in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> yesterday the report of a Morgan poll showing that 77.3 per cent of voters in Mr Andrews' own electorate disapproved of his bill. This is a really interesting test case for representative democracy as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I know from the letters I have received that many Australians are unhappy with the idea that this decision is being taken by parliamentarians, rather than by a referendum. I will be supporting Senator Brown's amendment calling for a referendum on this matter. The sad fact is that it is a destined to be a largely token gesture because it is ultimately up to the government of the day to decide which matters they will take to a referendum. I do not think the government would be honest 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1712"> enough to take this one to the people of Australia. I would hope that those senators who are supporting Mr Andrews' bill will at least agree on the appropriateness of putting to a referendum a matter of such importance to the individual rights, lives and autonomy of all Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I would like to say I feel very privileged to be part of this ongoing debate on voluntary euthanasia. There is much public confusion as to what is meant by euthanasia. This was shown by the previous two speakers when they both cited the apparent high level of community support for euthanasia. Senator Faulkner talked about 78 per cent support in a Morgan poll and 75 per cent in Newspoll. I think there is a big difference between the withdrawal of forms of medical life support and medically assisted suicide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The World Medical Association declaration, adopted in October 1987, describes euthanasia as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Euthanasia, that is the act of deliberately ending the life of a patient, even at the patient's own request or at the request of close relatives, is unethical. This does not prevent the physician from respecting the desire of a patient to allow the natural process of death to follow its course in the terminal phase of sickness.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was adopted by the 39th World Medical Assembly in 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this in mind, the scene has been set by the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, which has focused the media on a few individuals who have been terminally ill and have chosen to end their lives. This has created a diversion from other important issues which now surround the insecure situation of many frail aged, terminally ill and other disabled and seriously disadvantaged members of our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a conscience vote and, if you cannot bare your soul in this debate, you never will. I think it has stirred the emotions of all of us in the federal parliament; certainly, it has for many thousands of other Australians. After all, there were a record 12,500 submissions to the Senate inquiry and it has generated more letters to my office&mdash;mostly handwritten&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">than any other issue in my 3&half; years in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a debate not simply about personal experiences we might have had with people close to us dying with a terminal illness, our particular religious beliefs or our views of the sanctity of life. It primarily concerns our making a decision about any government's capacity to play a role in assisting suicide, and I do not believe a government should have that capacity&mdash;nor, if it did, could I be sure that it would be able to exercise it safely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I am disappointed that the issue has been forced to the Senate in a way where it can be confused with legitimate constitutional arguments about the rights and powers exercised by the Australian states and territories. Particularly in this case it is the Northern Territory legislation that has brought us to this debate tonight, and I acknowledge Kevin Andrews for being the catalyst&mdash;an unpleasant but necessary role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states rights argument is simply facile, and I say that having the highest respect for the Northern Territory&mdash;their growth, their development, their commitment to building a thoroughly modern Australian society and their commitment to racial equality. All those things are to be commended but, on this issue, they have got it wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To walk away from such a fundamental issue as voluntary euthanasia by saying, `Whilst the Commonwealth has the legal power to override it, we don't have the moral power,' is just not a valid argument. To do so when we have the power under section 122 of the constitution is akin, I believe, to a legal conviction not taking place because of a technicality. When this happens, it brings the law into disrepute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we hide behind states rights, we will be bringing the federal parliament&mdash;and in fact Australia&mdash;into disrepute. I would be a lot happier if I heard those who champion states rights talk a little more about a state's or territory's responsibilities, because I cannot agree that such a fundamental decision as the Northern Territory legislation being passed with a bare majority in a very small legislature is a responsible act. I apologise for that if it is necessary, but it will be difficult to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1713"> persuade me that the Northern Territory has got it right when others in the world have looked at voluntary euthanasia&mdash;full as it always is with subjective checks and balances&mdash;and said, `We don't want to go down that track.' It seems untenable to me that not only do we have a law that controls life and death; we have a law that  makes behaviour legal in Darwin that is illegal in Adelaide; legal in Alice Springs that is illegal in Albury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us be honest. Vote for euthanasia if you wish, but don't try to obfuscate. You are not making your decision on such a fundamental issue because of your belief in the importance of states rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The supporters of euthanasia emphasise that a dying person must have the freedom of choice and the right to get another person to kill them or to facilitate their suicide. Where there is extreme pain and suffering, it is difficult to argue this is morally wrong because euthanasia is not about discontinuing treatment, turning off machines or providing pain relief which hastens death. The less difficult moral question is whether the state can safely legalise such actions and practices, and I believe it cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AMA, the premier health lobby group, in their position statement on euthanasia in May 1996 opened with the sentence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AMA believes that doctors should not be involved in interventions that have, as their primary goal, the ending of a person's life.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I believe the AMA's position is mirrored by the great majority of health workers across the nation. The adopted AMA position endorses the right of patients to refuse treatment and the right of a severely or terminally ill patient to have relief of pain and suffering even when that therapy may shorten their life. Again, I have no problem with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AMA makes special note of the importance of palliative care. I acknowledge the great advances that have been made in this area and, if something good can come out of this wide&hyphen;ranging debate, it will be if pain relief and palliative assistance to terminally ill patients is improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AMA suggests this would include the provision that every major metropolitan and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> regional health care facility have a designated palliate care service for its catchment area, that the teaching of palliative medicine be further developed as an important component of undergraduate and postgraduate training programs and that doctors with an interest in palliative medicine be able to undertake further specialist training. Clearly, the importance of home care for terminally ill people and the importance of helping those who care for those people at home should be acknowledged and supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In politics we argue a lot about what we&mdash;mostly as political parties, but also as politicians&mdash;see as the rights and wrongs in what are essentially grey issues. In other words, the real black and white issues are mostly agreed on, although the general community would not necessarily be generous enough to give us that credit. All politicians argue as if they believe the angels are on their side, but this issue is fundamentally a question about how you see your role of governing in the best interests of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot see that legislating for voluntary euthanasia improves the prospects of the people, and that is the test I try to apply. In fact, I believe it does the opposite. Frankly, my conscience tells me that life is given by a force greater than human kind and it is not for humans to take it away.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996, a private member's bill brought before the parliament by Mr Kevin Andrews, the member for Menzies in the House of Representatives. He, like any member of either house, has every right to propose a bill for the parliament's consideration. While not a great number of private members bills are passed into law&mdash;13 in the Commonwealth parliament since federation&mdash;this bill has been passed by the House of Representatives and now awaits the judgment of the Senate. The purpose of the Euthanasia Laws Bill is to prevent the legislatures of the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory and Territory of Norfolk Island from passing certain laws permitting euthanasia. In the case of the Northern Territory, the bill prospectively invalidates the Northern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1714"> Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In debating the principles of the bill, it is pertinent to outline what is meant by the term `euthanasia'. The word derives from the Greek `eu' meaning `good or well' and `thanatos' meaning `death'. The word, thus, has a literal meaning of `gentle or easy death'. In contemporary debates, however, the word is used with a variety of meanings. Many people use a definition of euthanasia which accords to their particular stance on the issue of euthanasia itself. There is not necessarily anything wrong with that but, in debating the question of euthanasia, it is pertinent to accept that there are various definitions which are used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are, however, certain distinctions which are generally accepted, irrespective of how narrowly or broadly the word euthanasia is defined. One such distinction is between active and passive euthanasia. The latter term refers to an action or actions which merely refrain from keeping a patient alive. Active euthanasia involves taking some positive action to end a patient's life, the type of approach used in the Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further distinction may be made between voluntary and involuntary euthanasia. Involuntary euthanasia involves the taking of someone's life, supposedly in that person's own interests, but in disregard of that person's views. Although most cases of involuntary euthanasia remain undetected, there is little doubt that these cases occur. This type of euthanasia is nothing other than plain murder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Euthanasia can also be classified as active voluntary euthanasia. In this case, deliberate action is taken to end life where a patient has requested that his or her life be terminated. There is a slight difference between active voluntary euthanasia and what may be termed `physician assisted suicide'. In both cases, the patient has expressed a desire for life to end, but with physician assisted suicide the health professional makes a lethal substance available and the patient dies at his or her own hand. Whichever basic definition for euthanasia is accepted, there is little doubt that the Northern Territory legislation relates to active 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> voluntary euthanasia and, so far, deaths which have occurred under this legislation have resulted from physician assisted suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An important question which must be addressed in relation to the Euthanasia Laws Bill is whether the federal parliament should be legislating to override a law passed by the Northern Territory parliament. Successful passage of this bill would also prevent the parliaments of the Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island from passing into law their own legislation similar to the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. The consequences for the Australian Capital Territory and for Norfolk Island are slightly different from those for the Northern Territory. Neither the Australian Capital Territory nor Norfolk Island has passed legislation similar to that of the Northern Territory, but both hold that they should not be fettered in doing so, if that were their desire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each of the three territories has a compelling argument: that if the federal parliament has delegated certain powers to a democratically elected territory parliament, there is a basic contradiction in later limiting that power by preventing that territory's parliament from making laws on a particular issue of public policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Due to the time which I have at my disposal, I will not canvass the Euthanasia Laws Bill as it relates to the Australian Capital Territory and the Norfolk Island territory, although many of my remarks will still be pertinent to those two territories. Australians have long accepted that our system of local government is established under state legislation and, from time to time, state governments take actions which affect local governments, in some cases suspending their operation. In a similar way, the territories' powers to legislate lie in the provisions of section 122 of the Australian constitution. In effect, section 122 states, inter alia, that the federal parliament may make laws for the government of any territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this constitutional provision, the Northern Territory has progressively been given the right to conduct its own affairs. In 1947, a legislative council was established with a minority of elected members. This 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1715"> changed over time and by 1968 there was a majority of elected members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1974 the Commonwealth parliament enacted the Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1974, establishing a fully elected legislative assembly of 19 members. Finally, in 1978, the Northern Territory (Administration) Act was repealed and replaced by the Northern Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act 1978. The Northern Territory parliament therefore now operates much like Australian state parliaments and the next logical step in the process is for the Northern Territory to be granted statehood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act provides in section 9 that the Governor&hyphen;General&mdash;in practice, the Commonwealth government&mdash;may disallow a law passed by the Northern Territory parliament within six months of the Northern Territory Administrator's assent to the law. Whether this provision should still exist at this stage of the territory's development is a matter for debate, but it does prevail and could have been used to disallow the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the Commonwealth government of the day was asked to use this provision to disallow the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. The government declined to use those powers, a senior adviser to the Prime Minister noting in a letter to a Northern Territory resident:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth government believes that the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 is a valid law of the Northern Territory and it is up to the people of the Northern Territory to express their views on that legislation rather than the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Euthanasia Laws Bill, if enacted, would amend not the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act but the actual Northern Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act 1978. The wording of that amendment would, however, prospectively invalidate the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a powerful argument that the Commonwealth should not override an act of the Northern Territory even if the  subject matter of that act is controversial. If the Commonwealth parliament does override the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, what would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be next? A precedent would have been established to encourage any elected member of the federal parliament to move that the Northern Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act 1978 be amended once again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a function of our democracy that the people are able to make a choice as to who should represent them in parliament, and if they discover that their choice was a wrong one then that choice can be changed at subsequent elections. For democracy to function we must accept that the people's collective choice may on occasions be flawed. So too can parliaments make mistakes, but what moral right does that give the Commonwealth parliament to override a majority decision of the Northern Territory parliament, whether that decision is regarded as right or wrong?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting, however, that in the Northern Territory there are opposing views on whether or not the Commonwealth should intervene. At a forum held in Darwin on 24 January 1997, at which I was present, Mr MacMichael, who introduced himself as chairman of the Darwin branch of the Northern Territory Country Liberal Party, strongly argued against Commonwealth intervention. Among other things, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Northern Territory is politically mature and it is our Rights of the Terminally Ill Act . . . If we have got it wrong, we should be the ones to correct it . . . I do not believe that in their sincerity of purpose, the  people here this evening will want to see the Andrews' Bill carried.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On the other hand, Mr Terry Secker, a resident of the Northern Territory, at the same forum indicated that he had no problem with Commonwealth intervention. Among other things Mr Secker said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have degenerated this into a Northern Territory statehood debate . . . We are not a state. We will not become a state while we have got such laws&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">It is against this vexed question of whether or not the Commonwealth should intervene that the actual subject matter of the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act must be examined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the debate on the legalisation of euthanasia, voluntary or otherwise, many factors are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1716"> intertwined with the importance our society places on the sanctity of human life. Legal questions, evolving social issues, the role of modern medicine, our personal experiences and moral considerations thread through this highly emotional issue. To me the basic question is whether the state should permit one person to take another's life or assist in the process of suicide. Even if the action is taken with the consent of the person who wishes to die, I cannot accept that as a civilised society we should have so little regard for human life that we could morally support such an action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, suicides occur daily, and many of us have been touched personally by having a loved one or a close personal acquaintance take his or her own life. But what do we do when we have the opportunity to try to prevent a suicide from occurring? Do we let a person jump without trying to talk that person into reconsidering his or her actions? Do we leave the motor running when we find someone overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning? Most of us would not. If we can prevent the loss of life we do so. This being the case, why are we willing to allow medical practitioners to assist in ending the life of those who want to suicide? Those who advocate that this should be allowed to occur speak of the pain and suffering of the patient, that palliative care is unavailable or is not providing relief and that there is no hope of recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely a significant factor in our health system should be the adequate provision of palliative care. And why should we not question whether a life may be taken when a misdiagnosis has occurred and recovery would have been possible? Why are we prepared to delegate the act of taking life or the assisting in the death of a patient to the medical profession, to which most of us entrust our health for the greater part of our lifetime?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, suggestions that medical practitioners be permitted to take life lawfully could have disastrous consequences for the practice of medicine. Traditionally patients and their families believe that an important factor in any recovery process is the certainty that medical practitioners will do everything in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their power to help patients regain their health. If euthanasia remains lawful in the Northern Territory and, indeed, spreads throughout the Commonwealth then the familiar bond between patients and their doctor could be undermined, leading to a loss of confidence in the medical profession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that some in our community have no problems with questions surrounding physician assisted suicide. On the other hand, I do. Life is too precious to allow it to be taken away deliberately by human intervention. Unlike some less civilised countries, Australia no longer has the death penalty for serious offences against society. We certainly do not condone horrific crimes, but we no longer believe that the state should take the life of those who transgress against its laws. And in doing so we no longer risk taking the lives of those who are completely innocent of any crime, something that has tragically occurred in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No comment on this bill would be complete without expressing fears that the failure of the Australian Senate to pass the Euthanasia Laws Bill could place the Australian people at the potential risk of becoming victims of what may be termed the `slippery slope' or `wedge' arguments in future law&hyphen;making in any of the states or territories. These arguments assert that if the taking of human life is allowed even under the guise of a merciful end to life, a dangerous wedge would be introduced which places all human life deemed to be `unworthy' or `undesirable' in a precarious condition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What rights to life would be available to the severely disabled, the disfigured or the intellectually handicapped? The list could go on with other categories being regarded as under threat. While some may contend that this is fanciful and even alarmist, it is a possibility which must be addressed. No-one knows for certain whether such unpalatable consequences may flow from the legalisation of euthanasia, but I do have deep reservations that it is possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In coming to a decision on this matter I must do so against my deep respect for human life. I cannot accept that it is morally correct to legislate that the life of fellow 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1717"> human beings may be taken by legal means. I accept that if physician assisted suicide is not available, suicide will, regrettably, still occur. Yet where we can prevent people from taking their own lives most of us would do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that leaves me with a dilemma. I cannot accept the legalisation of euthanasia, voluntary or otherwise, nor do I find it easy to accept that this parliament should override an act which was passed by the Northern Territory parliament. I have three options in relation to the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. I can abstain, I can vote against this bill to maintain the status quo in the Northern Territory or I can vote for the bill in the knowledge that my vote could be crucial in casting aside the Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept the fact that some members of the House of Representatives abstained when this bill was voted on in their chamber. Similarly, I accept that there could be some in the Senate who may do likewise. I respect their decision, but I do not believe on this issue that abstention is an option about which I would feel comfortable. I believe that I must make a decision either to support or oppose the bill. Despite my grave concerns about this parliament's interference with legislation that has been duly passed by the Northern Territory parliament, I will vote in favour of the Euthanasia Laws Bill. To do otherwise would be for me to reject the lifelong belief that I have held that we must resist all attempts to devalue the preciousness of human life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to mention that, as I am sure has been the case for many senators, I have received a veritable avalanche of mail and personal representations on the Euthanasia Laws Bill. A great many proposed that I should vote for the bill. Others argued otherwise. I am sorry that the resources of my office were not sufficiently adequate to respond to all those representations. Nevertheless, I accepted without reservation the sincerity of those representations either for or against. I trust that those who asked me to vote against this bill will similarly accept that I did respect their views, but that my vote 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will be one which sincerely reflects my views on the sanctity of life.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that the Northern Territory legislation was actually introduced into the Northern Territory parliament in February 1995 and was assented to in June 1995. It is now 1997. I do not say that delay rules out intervention by this parliament, but I do say that this was an issue in 1995. It could have been an issue at the election in March 1996. It was not taken up then. It may have been preferable, if this parliament wanted to exercise the courage of its convictions, if it did so at the time knowing an election was around the corner. There is nothing that focuses the mind of parliamentarians and politicians and brings them closer to the face of public opinion than an election. That did not happen, but that does interfere with the Senate's right to do as it chooses on this bill. It does give some indication of not so much bona fides but the will behind those who now move this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I took the opportunity recently to read a particularly interesting book prior to this debate. It is called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Godless Constitution</EMPHASIS> and is subtitled `The case against religious correctness'. It is about the constitution of the United States and what is described as a crucial intellectual connection between what is a Godless constitution&mdash;that is, the constitution of the United States&mdash;and a God fearing people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It highlights deTocqueville's belief that religion is essential to the health of republican liberty and his concern that religion should not be too close to political institutions and to topical political controversy. Its place was in directing the customs of the community and in regulating domestic life. The risk for religion, it is argued by the authors and deTocqueville, is that once it gets enmeshed in the ever changing world of politics it will be degraded and cannot possibly hope to take hold. Public and political opinion is not stable but volatile. Political argument can be rough and tough and that is not a bad thing, but religion deserves a safer, stronger and more 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1718"> respectful place. That clearly is in the hearts and minds of citizens and not in legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always believed, to speak in a colloquial way, that any God is looking for converts not conscripts. Equally, I have always been taken with the response in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Man for All Seasons </EMPHASIS>of Sir Thomas More to the exclamations of his daughter and son&hyphen;in&hyphen;law. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Margaret: Father, that man's bad.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More: There is no law against that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Roper: There is! God's law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More: Then God can arrest him.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The question for me is: should voluntary euthanasia be legal under Australian law? I think it should be. Your life is not mine to take, but what I do with mine should be between me and my God and no-one else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The book outlines, among other things, the path of one Roger Williams, whom I had not heard of until reading this book, who is described as an `ardent Puritan' and a `godly minister' who was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1631. He went off and set up a new colony on Rhode Island. He was banished because he was determined to separate church and state as we have done. His view is described as being that `religion might influence how people behaved in all areas of their lives, but what they did in the name of God had no claims upon their neighbour's conscience'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the risk&mdash;and it is a risk&mdash;of ever claiming that God's work is being done through legislation is highlighted most aptly by the remarks with respect to Lincoln and the Civil War. I, again, quote from the book:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the bloodbath that was America's Civil War, Lincoln puzzled over the fact that both sides prayed to the same God, read the same Bible, and claimed to do His will. Lincoln suspected that if God wanted anything it was that the leaders who were entrusted to manage a fragile, precious experiment in democratic government remember that what is most assured about humankind is its collective and individual moral imperfection.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Protecting the separation of church and state often earns rebuke. Thomas Jefferson&mdash;it was a surprise to me to discover&mdash;who regularly went to church and contributed money to churches, was labelled by many clergy as an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> infidel, an atheist, a deist or a devil. He apparently kept his own bible with Greek, Latin, French and English translations and added in his own views. He rejected, nonetheless, a call to publish the bible and beat the `infidel' tag, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have ever thought religion a concern purely between our God and our consciences, for which we were accountable to Him, and not the priests.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The book concludes that the framers of the American constitution recognised:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that social peace and personal happiness are better served by separating religious correctness from public policy. The success of what they proposed should still fill us with amazement and gratitude.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Having read the book, I ask the question: by what right then can anyone claim that, because they believe it is wrong to take your own life, you may not do so with any dignity? I cannot find one. I could not look a terminally ill person in the eye and say that, if they wanted to end the gift of life&mdash;and it is that&mdash;they would have to throw themselves in front of a train, jump off a building or fumble around and find the right mix of legally available drugs. The decision whether to take your life or not is surely the most personal you can make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Palliative care for many, mercifully, is a viable alternative, but it does not always relieve the pain. When it does, it can bring other negatives in its place&mdash;incoherence, unconsciousness, incontinence, and the list could go on. It seems odd to me that we can agree that a life support can be turned off, bringing an end to life, but we cannot bring ourselves to let someone bring an end to their own life. Many claim that those who are terminally ill are assisted now by the medical profession, and I believe that. I simply believe that the patients ought to be empowered to make that final decision themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not always agree with Jeff Kennett, the Premier of Victoria, and least of all his numerous missives from the luxury of a government with the control of both houses, but I do agree that voluntary euthanasia is all about choice, and perhaps Mr Kennett will introduce in Victoria similar legislation to the Northern Territory model. Were that to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1719"> happen, we would have the same situation that we have now&mdash;that is, people can go to one state and follow their choice and go to others and not have it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So no-one need vote for this legislation thinking that they will necessarily guarantee a harmony of laws around Australia on this issue, because they will not. Mr Kennett's view has been made very clear, and one would assume that, on the basis of that view being clear, it might not be long before Victoria or another state chooses to follow suit. You choose if you want to end your life. The Northern Territory legislation allows you to get assistance&mdash;proper, expert, up-to-date medical and technological assistance&mdash;in doing that yourself, not for someone else to kill you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not take up the time of the Senate with the details of the published letters from two of the four people who have chosen to use the Northern Territory legislation; excerpts from two will suffice. This is a much publicised quote from Mr Bob Dent:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If I were to keep a pet animal in the same condition as I am in, I would be prosecuted.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And no doubt he would be. I quote Janet Mills from my state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At least now I can legally and honestly end my life. I hope this law survives and is able to help others like me who have found the suffering has become too great.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I know that I would not be able to look Mrs Mills in the eye and say that I thought the Commonwealth should act to stop her exercising the choice the Northern Territory law gave her. I could not say, `If you want to end your life, you'll have to do it the hard way,' and I could not say that I would support a law that would force her to continue to endure her suffering. Others may be comfortable with that outcome, but I am not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A society that forces terminally ill people to live without dignity is not a humane or compassionate society. We have the means to let people, if they choose, go gracefully. We ought not deny them that dignity or that choice.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to share with the Senate what has been a long and very hard 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> journey in the back of my brain. I do not appreciate Mr Andrews provoking me to take this journey, but I have to say that I am not unhappy with what I have learnt on the way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to share with you some of the ideas and issues that I have deliberated about, some of the steps on that journey. There are three main areas that I want to talk about: informed consent, private versus public ethic, and then I will turn to the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I turn to those points, there are a couple of other things I would like to make clear. First of all, I must declare a conflict of interest here&mdash;not that I am alive and will one day die, though I suppose that is true for us all, but that I am a member of the medical profession, and as a member of that medical profession my first&hyphen;up response was to be annoyed, irritated and even angry that the medical profession had been drawn into this debate. If people wanted to suicide, why did they not do it, why did they not just get on with it? They do not need prescriptions for fatal drugs, medications&mdash;why involve the medical profession?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I thought along this line, I realised that in some ways the medical profession had actually asked for it. Over the last 10 to 20 years doctors have very often used high&hyphen;tech medicine, surgical procedures, on very old or frail or terminally ill patients to the point where the communities cried in a very clear voice, `Stop. Leave my relative, leave my child, leave my mother, leave my father, alone. Let them be. Let them die in peace. Let us give people pain&hyphen;killers, palliative care. Let them be comfortable.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, I can share with the Senate a patient I had once in St Vincent's Hospital in Melbourne who was dying of a very serious liver disease. He was admitted to the hospital and put into intensive care. Some time later, at his insistent request, he was removed from intensive care to a ward where he came under my care, where I got to meet and talk with him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He actually had some great lines. He said that being in intensive care with tubes in every orifice was not exactly a comfortable way to live and, besides, the other patients were not very talkative. It was very interest 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1720"> ing to meet the sense of humour in such a patient. He also said that the other people in the intensive care unit kept dying, which was not very encouraging either; he felt it was setting an example for him and that he preferred, please, to be taken away from all that high&hyphen;tech paraphernalia and to be admitted to a general ward to let things take their course so that he could at least live out the rest of his life in some sort of dignity. He felt that being hooked up to everything that worked in intensive care was anything but dignified. I might tell you, although you must have gathered, that this patient was of course acutely conscious. He was one of the many that gave me some pause about what the medical profession was doing in a lot of that intervention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that as a result of the community crying `Stop' on behalf of their family and relatives we have seen what are called something like the `natural death acts' in various parts of this country that have given people legislative authority to choose their treatment and management as they died of terminal illness&mdash;and the right sometimes to say they wanted no extraordinary treatment, to have machines turned off and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I realise that although I might have at first been a bit annoyed about the involvement of the medical profession they had indeed asked for it, that is, for their participation in this area. And I also believe it is entirely proper for the medical profession to be involved. They do have special knowledge and a special responsibility. They do not have&mdash;as one of my colleagues was arguing last night&mdash;any claim to extra wisdom. In passing, I say that I think it is much harder for the nursing profession, who are very often much closer to the person dying and their family and yet have much less say in the management of that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Next I want to turn to a point of considerable concern. I have received, as everybody else has, hundreds, if not thousands, of letters about this issue. One argument put by a number of writers was that a conscience vote for a Labor Party person was not a real conscience vote at all; it was merely a release from being bound to Labor Party policy and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we could make up our own mind. I was bemused by the desperate logic of this argument&mdash;used, I might say, by both sides of the debate&mdash;and somewhat saddened at the presumption that I or any of us would not be making an informed choice or that indeed if we voted along party political lines that was not an informed choice either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it did challenge me to then do some thinking about what an informed choice is and how we make one. It requires, I think, that we seek a broad range of relevant information and in the light of that information make our decision. We seek the information from facts, opinions from people whose judgment we value, wise folk, parents, church, culture, social mores, historical example, community values and of course much more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the weighing up of the facts and the arguments that is the harder part. Assembling the facts is not much of a problem, but weighing them is very hard. How do I rank and order them? How do I decide what matters most? In this case, is my decision only a matter for me or do I need to include what matters also, very importantly, for others? As a politician can I make a decision that takes no regard of the impact of my decision on the rest of the community? To what extent are the consequences of any decision of mine, as well as I can assess them, part of that information that I need to take into account in making an informed choice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, if I conclude that the euthanasia question overrides the territory rights question and I therefore disregard the territory, what does that mean for future territorial legislation and what does that mean for me next time such a question is debated in this place? On the other hand, if I decide that the question of territory rights is the critical issue, am I effectively excluding myself from an informed choice on the question of euthanasia? I believe in fact that that conundrum is the worst feature of this bill&mdash;a choice between two very significant areas of principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard a number of senators argue that they believe in state and territory rights but not now or not in this instance. I do not find that a persuasive point of view. To me, the spuri 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1721"> ous argument that Northern Territory law is for all Australians and therefore the Northern Territory has stepped outside its jurisdiction is not a sufficient argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I am sure that somebody will point out the incorrectness of my next comments, but I did think, in deliberating about this, that when Queensland abolished death duties and the rest of Australia rushed to Queensland to die we did not argue that away on the basis of state rights. Thank you. At least Senator Tambling smiles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The better argument in this case is to say that the protection of life and the protection of territory rights are two very important principles. How are people going to rank them? People should simply say, `I believe the question of the right to life outranks state rights', or `I believe vice versa.' I believe the Commonwealth has the power to intervene in these laws in the Northern Territory, but we should ask why it needs to and whether this is a proper use of Commonwealth powers. The fact that you can do it does not mean that it is necessarily proper or appropriate to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last part of my deliberations was about comparing the public and the private ethic. There are people and politicians who cannot allow any difference between their private ethic and their public stance on issues. They are not persuaded that a public ethic takes into account a different range of issues, or that, for example, they might properly consider the differing beliefs of people in a pluralist society or the common good&mdash;as apart from that of an individual&mdash;in making a decision of informed conscience. Others believe that it is proper and reasonable to vote for a decision in the public realm, even if it does conflict with individual beliefs and behaviours. There are many examples: one I came up with was the question of contraception. Many people would decide that that was not appropriate for them to use but, equally, they might be able to vote that other people should have the opportunity to use it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now turn to the main points about the legislation. The debate has been very widespread in the community and very wide ranging in its arguments. To my mind, much of the debate has been misinformed, mislead 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing and very illogical. First of all, there is the argument of the slippery slope&mdash;that, if we start here and oppose Mr Andrews's bill, we will continue on and on and the next thing we will see will be widespread involuntary euthanasia: the killing of the elderly, the disabled, the unwanted and the weak.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has absolutely nothing to do with involuntary euthanasia. It has absolutely nothing to do with killing people without their consent. It has absolutely nothing to do with killing people by doing deals between relatives and doctors. There is absolutely no reason why you could conclude that this legislation would lead to any of those steps. This legislation is focused around the right of the patient to choose. In all of those examples&mdash;the killing of those who are disabled or defective in some way&mdash;no argument has ever been led that they are based on or around patient choice. The slippery slope line is a completely contrary argument and, therefore, completely spurious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it breathtaking that people who would argue the slippery slope line would then say, by way of defence, `We don't need to worry anyhow&mdash;lots of people are finding an easy way to death through palliative care.' At the moment, the practice is that many people receive lethal injections of pain&hyphen;killers. But that is not the intention. The intention is to relieve pain, not to kill people, but it is widely accepted that those injections do&mdash;as Senator Vanstone spelt out&mdash;lead to the death of the patient. So we are saying, on the one hand, that we oppose a clear law that allows patient choice but, on the other, that we support a current practice that is not patient centred but doctor centred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The palliative care argument is about a doctor choice, not a patient choice and if people are serious about the content of, the quality of and the right to life, they should be very shocked about the number of people who are being killed in the name of palliative care. I am told the difference is in intent: the intention is to relieve pain and not to kill the patient and, therefore, there is no need for this legislation, because this practice is within the current law. If that is the case, it is not going 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1722"> to be affected by the Northern Territory legislation. The current practice will be able to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So where is the rub? The rub is that this Northern Territory legislation brings into the open the truth of the situation and the truth of the choice the patient is making. The Northern Territory legislation is up&hyphen;front and honest. It is very restrictive in its application and has many safeguards built into it. It provides legal authority for the dying patient to determine the time of their death. It is not about relatives or the doctor making that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far in the Northern Territory it has not been about the doctor killing anyone either: all the deaths have been suicides provided by the patient themselves. It is true that they have been assisted, but the actual ending of life has been an act of the patient themself. If it were possible, I would prefer to see the Northern Territory legislation amended to allow only for patient&hyphen;driven suicide, but I understand that sometimes&mdash;due to frailty or other impediments&mdash;the capacity to terminate life is beyond a patient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more I have heard the arguments and thought about the issue&mdash;and I have thought about it at great length&mdash;the more it has become clear that the Northern Territory legislation is enabling and not prescriptive. No one is compelled to use it, but, should they so choose, they have the weight and the dignity of the law to support that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with some interest that the House of Representatives vote was 88 to 35 in favour of the Andrews bill. That is very interesting because it is so different from the community view expressed in polls, letters from constituents and so on. As is often the case, the community is way ahead of the legislators&mdash;even the Northern Territory legislators. I have heard it argued in this place that the people in the community, when they participate in the polls, do not quite know what they are voting for or expressing an opinion on. That is particularly offensive to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people in the community are very clear&mdash;certainly the people that I understand and have spoken to on this. They believe that they support the right of people to decide on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their treatment and pain management, on the right to refuse special interventions or high&hyphen;tech medicine. They support the right of people to choose the time of their death if they are dying from a terminal illness and are in intolerable pain and discomfort. They are also very clear that they do not support relatives or doctors making that decision without the patient's involvement and consent. The community, it seems to me, is very clear about where the line is drawn. The Northern Territory legislation, which I believe gives a fair effect to that community decision, allows public scrutiny of such decisions. As I have said, it sets very restrictive criteria of how it should be effected and it does depend on the patient making that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To die with dignity surrounded by friends and family&mdash;that is what most terminally ill people want. Most will and do choose palliative care. A small number will exercise their option under the Northern Territory legislation. But in the end, what is the difference here? Is it better that people die as a result of large doses of drugs administered by their doctor to alleviate pain rather than as a result of a large dose of drugs designed to alleviate pain administered by themselves? I have come to the conclusion that, in this legislation, it is proper to support the right of patients to choose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that I was very struck by in reading the many, many things that I did read in deliberating on this issue is an article called `The continuing Northern Territory euthanasia debate' by Richard Ottley and Jackie Dempsey in the journal of the Medical Defence Union of January 1997. It describes the state of play and what has happened to this point, including the court challenge to the Northern Territory Supreme Court. It quotes a comment of Justice Angel who, as a dissenting judge, found in favour of the plaintiffs in that Supreme Court decision that the Northern Territory act was valid. His quote reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view, the heads of power in regulation 4 of the Self&hyphen;Government Regulations, whether read liberally or restrictively, give no warrant to the legislative establishment of institutional termination of life other than as a punishment. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1723">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The rest of it does not matter to me. We have a history that says we could establish an institutional termination of life for punishment, yet tonight we are deliberating on whether or not we can a have an institutional termination of life not as punishment but as part of peace and palliation. I find the choice very compelling, that we have moved on from institutional legislation of the termination of life as punishment to allowing the prospect of terminally ill patients to determine the time of their own dying.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was an interesting contribution. It puts me in mind of the observation by the 17th century French philosopher Blaise Pascal in Pensees when he said that there is sufficient light for those who desire and seek the light and sufficient darkness for those who are of a contrary disposition. I do not propose to speak for very long. I do not suppose that I could throw much more light on the subject than has been thrown on it in discussions on this matter over the years. But I do recommend to those who have not read the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's report on the Euthanasia Laws Amendment Bill that they do so, because there is a great deal of information in that report which would throw light on the subject and which in fact go to the points that have been raised by Senator Crowley&mdash;if she would only read it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At 10.05 p.m. on 25 May 1995, 13 of the 25 members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly voted to support a euthanasia bill which was strangely entitled the Rights of the Terminally Ill Bill. For the first time in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the world, the deliberate and intentional killing of one innocent adult human being by another was legalised by an act of parliament&mdash;for the first time in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Stripped of all its euphemism, euthanasia occurs when the doctor, not the illness, kills the patient. In fact, the Northern Territory law recognises this. The Northern Territory law does not change the law for the patient; it actually changes the law for the doctor, enabling him to kill. At a time when civilised countries throughout the world are abolishing the death penalties, politicians in the Northern Territory, by one vote, have instituted a licence for the doctor to kill. At a time when political, medical and community concern about suicide abounds, those Northern Territory parliamentarians, through their legislature, have legalised assisted suicide and promoted a culture of death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">True compassion means caring for and suffering with another person, not putting that person to death. In this utilitarian, excessively individualistic and hedonistic society, the value of suffering for personal growth and for the opportunity to love and to serve is ignored. The experience of having one's wife die of cancer in one's arms and of one's mother, a long&hyphen;time Alzheimer's patient, also die in one's arms confirms the knowledge that life is for more than this earth. The person with whom life and love had been intimately shared does not cease to exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all need to understand the difference between euthanasia and the undoubted right of a terminally ill patient to refuse overburdensome and disproportionate medical treatment. That is dealt with in the report. Euthanasia should also not be confused with measures to relieve pain, such as the responsible use of analgesics. Unfortunately, if euthanasia becomes accepted and becomes law, as it is in the Northern Territory, the demand for resources needed for good  palliative care will be stifled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just a few weeks ago one of my sons, who works in a nearby aged care centre, told me that even now some of the residents ask him if they are really being a burden. Some of them do feel that they are a burden, particularly on their relatives. How much worse will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1724"> they feel if euthanasia legislation is enacted? Many of them will feel pressured to make a deadly choice. The question will be raised in their minds. Yes, you might say this is voluntary euthanasia, but the question will be raised in their minds, and will inevitably be raised in their minds, as to whether they should do something about unburdening people, particularly their relatives. That is a question that should indeed be out of the question for those people and for all others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former South Australian Governor Sir Mark Oliphant told the ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program last year that `. . . there are too many people who are now no longer part of humanity, as it were, still being kept alive in homes and even in their own homes by their relatives'. He told of a scientist friend who `should be dead and he's not. He just loves to be alive and to be a damned nuisance to all his friends and relatives . . . I think he's cluttering up the world at a time when he should not'. All I can say about that is: will it become a crime to love life and not want to be forced to leave it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had evidence given to the committee relating to the slippery slope&mdash;very telling evidence indeed. We have been given evidence by, for example, Disabled Peoples International who are very concerned about this piece of legislation as to what it might do ultimately to persons with disabilities. I do not need to go into all of that material because it is in the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should ask ourselves this question: who will be affected most by the decisions of those 13 Northern Territory politicians? I believe it will be the marginalised, the sick, the frail aged and those who lack self-esteem, and not just in the Northern Territory. The push for euthanasia through all the states has been buoyed by that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, that decision of an elected parliament was the first of its kind in the world. It has been suggested that we should not attempt to override the Northern Territory legislature, even though that particular piece of legislation will potentially affect all Australians and certainly affect those people who choose to go to the Northern Territory. So it does affect other Australians besides those in the North 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ern Territory. The key issue is whether we in this parliament have a very valid reason to, in effect, overturn the Northern Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say to the Senate that I am wearing the badge of the Northern Territory. I am quite honoured to wear the badge of the Northern Territory. I was born in the northern part of South Australia. My grandfather happened to be the boiler attendant for the old steam train in the Finke, which, as you know, is near the border of the Northern Territory and South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say that there are quite a few Harradines around the place and most of them are Aboriginals, which is something that has not been brought up in this particular debate. I noticed Senator Kernot wondered why I voted a certain way in respect of the Hindmarsh Bridge; she presumably did not know what I just mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what I want to say about the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory is that all of the Aboriginal evidence that was given to the committee was against euthanasia. One of the most telling pieces of evidence came from the person who was appointed by the Northern Territory government to go around the Northern Territory Aboriginal communities to teach them about the fact that the Northern Territory rights of the terminally ill legislation was voluntary. He came to our committee and asked our committee to overturn the Northern Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He, himself, actually had no problems with the rights of the terminally ill legislation, but he came before us and asked us to overturn it because, he said, the very existence of the Northern Territory legislation presented a danger to the health and wellbeing of the Aboriginals of the Northern Territory, because they were likely to become afraid of presenting themselves to medical doctors, clinics and the like. Now that is all in this report. I do not think it has been adverted to yet; it may well have been. I think it was adverted to last night, but I have not heard it tonight. It is a very important question when we are considering this legislation because the Commonwealth parliament, under the constitution, has a specific and special duty in relation to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1725"> Aboriginal people by virtue of the referendum that took place on that matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory legislation threatens to undermine the cornerstone of society, which depends on the inalienable nature of the right to life of every individual human being. This inalienable right was enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights agreed to by the international community following the Nazi horrors. That is another reason why I believe that we should pass the Euthanasia Laws Bill, which would overturn the Northern Territory legislation&mdash;because I approach this matter from a human rights perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then the first two rights are: everyone has the right to life and everyone has the right to liberty. And they are inalienable rights. Let us take the right to liberty. No legislature can legislate to approve of a person selling themself into slavery. And the right to life is inalienable. No legislature can approve of a person requiring another person to take that person's life. But that is exactly what the Northern Territory legislation has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have said, `It is a democracy. It is a democratically elected place, the Northern Territory legislature&mdash;they have their rights.' Other people, and Senator Brown, have said, `Let's have a referendum about it.' What I say about that is this: you have to deal with these matters on the question of principle. Either the right to life is inalienable or it is not; either it is equal and inalienable or it is not. In my view, and, in fact, in the view of the international community, it is inalienable; otherwise the very foundations of civilised society begin to crumble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to referenda: if you had had a referendum in Tasmania on capital punishment after Port Arthur, you would have had an overwhelming vote for capital punishment. If I had been in the state parliament, do you think I should have gone ahead and tried to move for a return to capital punishment? Certainly 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not. As a longstanding opponent of capital punishment, certainly not. I take the same view here because I believe that it is barbaric and it is barbaric for a legislature to legalise one person taking the life of another innocent human being.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So a referendum is not the answer. Similarly, the polls are not the answer. I repeat: the Northern Territory legislation threatens to undermine the cornerstone of society which depends on the inalienable nature of the right to life of every individual human being. That inalienable right, as I mentioned before, is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. On that inalienability rests the edifice of laws which seek to protect the lives of human beings. From that inalienability flows the human solidarity needed to achieve justice for all&mdash;the reverse of legislation whereby the value of life is eclipsed and a culture of death is inculcated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the higher name of human rights, which transcends state and territory rights, the Commonwealth parliament has a duty to render the legislation of the Northern Territory inoperable by passing the Euthanasia Laws Bill which is currently before us.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the legalisation of assisted suicide, which is what the Northern Territory act is all about. I note that, at times in this debate, the supporters of that legislation have tried to characterise this debate as being a battle between conservative Christians who are seeking to impose morals on the rest of the community versus progressive upholders of human rights and individual freedom. I reject that. I certainly make no apology for the fact that I am a Christian, but I believe that putting the debate in that context is not only flawed but also simplistic in the extreme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that honourable senators are well aware of my background of service in the Uniting Church, but my position on this bill is based on a broad commitment to human rights and social justice, which is one of the core principles of the Australian Democrats and the reason why I am proud to belong to that party. As a member of the Democrats, I am committed to defending and supporting those who are most vulnerable and to doing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1726"> what I can to prevent our society moving further down the road where rampant individualism and survival of the fittest becomes the dominant ideology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not forget that those who oppose the Northern Territory act are not just a bunch of extreme Christian conservatives. I received a letter today from Gallarrwuy Yunupingu of the Northern Land Council emphasising the strong opposition of the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory to the euthanasia law. He states quite unequivocally&mdash;and the same evidence was given to the committee&mdash;that that law has already affected the standard of health care to indigenous people of the territory. The vast majority of groups who work with disabled people and the aged have also expressed opposition, as do many in the psychiatric and palliative care professions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> On the other hand, I understand the compassion which drives many supporters of euthanasia, but I believe their compassion is misplaced. In effect, the philosophy which underpins the support of legalised euthanasia is the philosophical and ethical equivalent of economic rationalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many years ago, I spent some time at the Aboriginal community of Millingimbi, an island off the coast of Arnhem Land. Whilst I was there, I observed the community as it surrounded with love and support one of its old men who was dying&mdash;a very significant man. It was an inspiring experience to watch the care with which his people prepared both him and themselves for his departure. He died a few days after I left. His was truly a good death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I contrast this experience with my time as a chaplain at a number of aged care institutions. For example, I remember well visiting an old woman at Pleasantville, a Uniting Church aged care complex in Brisbane. I visited her regularly for one reason, because the nursing staff were unable to get her family to come and see her. Even as she was dying, repeated phone calls were ignored by her family. In the end, she died alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Our western culture has great problems with death. It deals with death often by denial or by trying to pretend that death is not a natural part of the process of living. In some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ways this debate is a symptom of the same problem. In my example, the Aboriginal people viewed life, dying and death as different parts of the same process which needs to be celebrated in the presence of friends, family and community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet one of the most common arguments used in the debate about death and dying is to infer that the process of dying is wholly negative. Clearly, there are some forms of death which are negative&mdash;the example I gave about the elderly woman at Pleasantville underlines this. However, even in the face of these negative experiences, we need to examine the source of that negativity. Is it inherent in the process of dying or has it more to do with our culture's attitude to death and the refusal to take seriously our responsibility to care and support those who are dying?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an article in the Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 23 June 1995, quoted by Dr Preston in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Understanding Ethics</EMPHASIS>, Elizabeth Hepburn wrote about the process of dying. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A philosophy which sees suffering as absurd will lead us to seek relief in the form of euthanasia. We must decide whether we will interpret the dispossession we experience in the face of suffering as absurdity or mystery. If we opt for mystery we will be committed to living life to the full in both ecstasy and sorrow.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I believe Elizabeth Hepburn puts her finger on the problem. The devaluation of human life, indeed of animal life and the natural environment, which is so much part of western culture can lead to the conclusion that life has no meaning and death is an absurdity. I do not accept this view of life, just as I do not accept the extreme form of individualism which also pervades western culture and which devalues any sense of community and mutual responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This individualism is also the foundation of economic rationalism which plagues our living and so devalues humanity that at its end we may be regarded as nothing more than unproductive burdens. The phrase `unproductive burdens' sounds like something the government might use to justify restricting welfare benefits to unemployed youth. In fact, it was used by the former Governor&hyphen;General in a speech about death and dying to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1727"> Royal Australian College of Physicians in 1995. Mr Hayden, speaking of his apprehension about the nature of his own death, referred to society's need to divest itself of those older people who no longer fulfilled any useful purpose by their living. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there is a point where succeeding generations deserve to be disencumbered . . . of some unproductive burdens.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am sure the Governor&hyphen;General believed he was proposing a positive obligation of the elderly to society; that is, not to live beyond the point at which they cease to contribute anything to society. I note what Mr Hayden was saying. I am sure he spoke sincerely but I reject completely his philosophy, just as I reject the notion of assisted suicide as contained in the Northern Territory bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some ways, the word euthanasia is a misnomer when it is used for voluntary assisted suicide. I repeat what Senator Colston said earlier that `euthanasia' comes from two Greek words, `eu' meaning good, whole and well&hyphen;being, and `thanatos' meaning death. I believe that the death of the old man at Millingimbi was truly a good death. The kind of euthanasia proposed by Bill Hayden is anything but a good death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This leads me to a consideration of individual rights. In this debate there has been a lot of talk about the right of each individual to choose the time of their own death. This reminds me of the economic rationalist credo that each individual should have the right to earn as much money as they wish. Both approaches remove the link of the individual with the wider community and society. If one is to accept the economic rationalist approach of total individual freedom which underlines the idea that each person has the sole right to choose to die, when and how they wish, why should this right be limited to the terminally ill? What about those with permanent, but non&hyphen;life threatening illnesses or disabilities? Should they be able to demand the right to be assisted to die? What about the depressed teenager who cannot find a job or who feels that life has no meaning? Should they have the right to demand to be assisted to die?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely it is discriminatory in the extreme to allow only those people with terminal illness 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> es the legal right to be assisted to die and refuse this so&hyphen;called right to others who also may wish to die. It is no secret that many young people feel disconnected from society and have trouble seeing a meaning or purpose in life. Indeed, this applies not just to young people. I believe this is clearly linked to the onset of consumerism and individualism. At a time when so many are expressing concern about the increase in youth suicide, what sort of message are we sending by continually asserting that it is some fundamental right to kill yourself whenever you feel like it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me address the issue of the right to choose. The argument for choice is based usually on arguments about the loss of quality of life, especially for older people. Again, Bill Hayden clearly described this position in his speech. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I view the prospect of the closing days of my old age with apprehension. I have visited too many nursing homes, seen too many vegetating old people who were once vigorous, vivacious personalities now dependent on their middle&hyphen;aged children . . . This loss of personal control, of autonomy, of human personality for me would destroy my sense of human dignity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We can empathise with his feelings. Again, I disagree with the position, while empathising with the feelings that Mr Hayden had. His position is the same as that taken by Dr Peter Singer in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rethinking Life &amp; Death</EMPHASIS> . Singer argues that medical practice and the law have moved away from an absolute position which proposed to treat all human beings as of equal worth to a new ethic which proposes to recognise that the worth of human life varies. I recommend that people read Professor Singer's book closely. It is mostly well argued, given the limitations of its utilitarian framework. Professor Singer is one of the most prominent and most enthusiastic advocates of euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard what Senator Crowley said but there is a slippery slope and it is very clearly set out in the evidence given to the committee. Part of that slippery slope, although it may be a well&hyphen;worn one, I would like to underline in Professor Singer's book where he clearly advocates that babies born with severe disabilities should be considered less important. He also proposes an arbitrary line of one 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1728"> month of age as a time when they become of equal value to other humans. This is the problem with the quality of life argument; that is, who decides where you draw the line and how you define quality of life?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true. On the other hand, I would like to put to you some of the points of view put by Dr Noel Preston in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Understanding Ethics</EMPHASIS> . Noel Preston is a long time colleague and friend of mine. He argues that while contemporary bioethical practice involves quality of life judgments, it is critical that this approach be situated within the wider framework of reverence for life. Dr Preston warns that without this wider framework, choices made exclusively on the basis of whether or not life is worth living may lead to horrific consequences for individuals and a breakdown in the sense of community solidarity. He writes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no reason why these bioethical dilemmas cannot be judged within a dialectic between sanctity and quality of life considerations, which results in respect for life. Indeed, the failure to do this may invite grave social errors, such as a careless depersonalising of the elderly, the deformed or the disabled which will, in turn, erode the bonds of covenantal integrity upon which the moral community depends.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further, Preston argues that quality of life judgments fit within contemporary social attitudes which elevate individual rights over the obligation to extend a duty of care to all members of society. In particular, the need to care for those who are most vulnerable in society is discounted within a society where physical prowess or economic productivity is the measure of individual worth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me address the issue of the conscience vote. Much has been made of this bill being a conscience vote. This has given us all the freedom and also the responsibility to think through the issues involved more deeply than sometimes may be the case. The Australian Democrats provide their parliamentarians with a conscience vote on all matters. However, it is important to note that Democrat policy is silent on the issue of legalising assisted suicide. The policy of the Democrats supports the right to die with dignity, and I believe the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> position I have taken is totally consistent with this policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that my time is rapidly running out, so I might just address a couple of other issues. The issue of states rights has, I think, been canvassed fairly widely, but let me add my concern about those who have all of a sudden discovered states rights in terms of this bill and some of those who would perhaps say states rights do not count in this particular instance. I have been perfectly consistent since I have been in this place. I have always maintained that human rights are far more fundamental in every case than states rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown voices his outrage that this bill overrides the rights of people of the territory to determine their own affairs and some members of the coalition are happy to override that principle on this occasion. I wonder whether their consistency needs to be challenged at this point. I hope that those members of the coalition might be willing to consider the national interest and human rights ahead of states rights in future cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also believe, as a number of speakers have mentioned, that we really do need to address the issue of euthanasia laws in other states because I am sure there will be a push, if the Andrews' bill is carried, for other states to an enact legislation in the future. I believe that whether it is by referendum&mdash;although, I am not in favour of that&mdash;or by legislation in this place, we really ought to address the issue at a national level so that it is clear in terms of all the states and territories rather than simply, as we have done, singling out the laws of one territory in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, let me address the issue of legislating for euthanasia. There are many other issues, but others will canvass those. Even if one believes in voluntary euthanasia, the issue remains: should such a belief be enshrined in legislation? Related to this question are a number of others. Is there not a danger that legalised euthanasia will put undue pressure on medical practitioners and nurses, subtly altering their duty to care? Is it possible to devise a law which is not open to abuse? If euthanasia is legal, might not an old person feel pressured to die because they are burden 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1729"> to their relatives? These are important questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude with a quote from the 1994 report of the Select Committee on Medical Ethics of the House of Lords. I do not have time to read all of it but just their concluding remarks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that the issue of euthanasia is one in which the interest of the individual cannot be separated from the interest of society as a whole.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to speak on the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996, or what has become known as the Andrews' bill. My contribution tonight will not be a long one, but one which comes from deep inside me in considering the issues. To follow a man of the cloth in this situation does make one feel rather humble.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first issue I want to deal with is what is loosely thrown around as states rights. I think the issue of states rights is so often misused to make a particular point, because Australia is a federation. One of the reasons we have enjoyed so much stability in this country and have been so receptive to so many people making this country their home is the strength of that federation. The strength of that federation is epitomised by what is carried out in this chamber of all the parliaments of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, in my time here almost every principal piece of legislation that has been passed here has been a modification to a much stronger view than had emanated out of the other place. We talk about state rights, but it is a lot more than state rights. It is our federation that makes Australia a very tolerant place for dealing with the many issues that we face. I would suggest that without federation, this country would be nowhere near as tolerant as it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some time ago, I made a public statement that I would not be supporting the Andrews bill. In saying that, I would like to thank the many people who have written to me and phoned me on this issue. I have heard almost every conceivable thought or view on this legislation. I have certainly been canvassed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more widely than I have been on any other piece of legislation that has ever come to my attention either pre coming into this chamber or since I have been here. So it has certainly raised an enormous interest. As to the community push, I measure from the mail that I have received in my office from all around Australia and overseas that 70 per cent of the people who have written support the Northern Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having been brought up in a very strong, strict Anglican family, the position one adopts is often dependent on one's life experience. In relating to federal legislation such as this, one can go no closer than to one's own mother and father and the life experience one has had with them. Unfortunately, it took my mother nearly four years after a series of strokes over a short period of time to pass away. That was a very difficult, harrowing experience. Equally unfortunately, my father was killed in a car accident. He just disappeared in a flash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember well that when the police arrived at home I was drafting sheep. I asked, `Can I finish before I talk to you?' I thought I was about to have a summons issued to me. Then they explained to me what had happened. Both those very different experiences certainly had a big impact on my reaction to life and death and how things happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other close experience I have had with death concerns my younger brother, the fifth&hyphen;born in our family. I was in Bali, and my sister was there. We got news that Phillip had had a massive stroke and passed away. My friends in Bali took me up to a Hindu temple. I prayed with them, and that is probably the most peaceful experience of my life. I had never been in a Hindu temple before that and I have never been back since. One day I will go back when I feel comfortable about doing it again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These experiences impact very much on one's thoughts when one deals with life and death. Having had these experiences, and dealing with the Andrews bill, I wish to read a short statement that I made some time ago with regard to this piece of legislation. It reads: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1730">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After much discussion and reviewing of the issues at hand, I have decided that I will not be supporting the Andrews Bill if in fact it ever reaches the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, it has now reached the Senate. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am strongly of the opinion that this is a very discriminatory Bill&mdash;discriminating against people&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I underline the word `people'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst I accept the fact that the Commonwealth has the law on its side to overturn the legislation passed by the Northern Territory Government, I believe that in this case it would be a misuse of the power. If the Northern Territory Act had been passed by a State Government, the Commonwealth would not be in a position to over&hyphen;ride that State's right.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">From that point of view, I would certainly agree with what Senator Woodley had to say, that this has to be looked at more from the national angle rather than the angle of the Northern Territory. But that could well be a debate for another time. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is wrong for the Federal Government to treat the citizens of a Territory differently to the citizens of the States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to make it clear that my decision is based on the fact that I firmly believe each State and Territory has the right&mdash;both moral and legal&mdash;to pass laws which affect its people. Any intervention by the Commonwealth must be able to be applied consistently right across Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is, to all citizens. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The very basis of Federation was that the State's would retain their autonomy&mdash;they would retain their rights. As Australia has grown as a nation, I feel it is incumbent on the Commonwealth to treat the Territories the same as the States.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Finally, I want to canvass one other issue&mdash;it has received some publicity, and I have had a number of phone calls about it&mdash;that is, my voluntary decision to pair with former Senator Woods on this position after he had spoken to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He explained to me at that time that he had a very strong view, which I respect, and it is the opposite of mine. As we all know, at that time Senator Woods was under a degree of pressure. He said to me, as I am sure he would have said to somebody else had I said no, that he would stay here until after the vote was taken on the issue if he could not get a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pair. It seemed to me that it would have been unreasonable to force him to stay here under the unfortunate circumstances that he found himself in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to those people who have phoned me, and I have had a couple of letters about it, that in no way has it changed my position on it. Nonetheless, at that particular time I believed&mdash;I still do&mdash;that that was the right thing for me to do in the circumstances which former Senator Woods had found himself in. I do not regret it, but I would like to put on the public record an explanation for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, I say to the very many people who are very sincere on both sides of the debate that I appreciate very much the letters that I have received, the phone calls, the comments and the discussions. It certainly has made me a more understanding and wise person.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this important euthanasia debate and will not speak for long. I know that there is a large number of speakers, and it is important that this debate be progressed as quickly as possible. So I plan to keep my remarks shorter than I would like to on what I regard as a very important bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate has been conducted in a way in which I have never seen a debate conducted in this parliament. You have to go back a couple of decades at least, perhaps to 1974, to find a similar debate where there was a conscience vote on legislation. I was not around at that time. I cannot remember the way that debate was conducted, but it seems to me that, despite the very high emotion which this issue correctly arouses in a large number of people, the debate has been conducted, for the most part, in a very civil manner. People have respected the views of others who do not share their position on the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. In that sense, it has been quite an historic debate, whatever the outcome of the vote may be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to make my position quite clear. I will be supporting the Euthanasia Laws Bill. Before I state my substantive reasons for that, I would like to look briefly at the issue of states rights which, I think, has correctly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1731"> caused concern amongst a number of people. Senator Brown, Senator Woodley and Senator Crane have raised that issue. My record would show that I have always been a strong supporter of states rights. Senator Brown, I noticed that you, on a number of occasions, have been more than willing to support the use of international treaties to override states rights. That is your view and I do not intend to exchange political point scoring on that matter in the context of this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming from a position of a person who strongly supports states rights, I do not find myself in the dilemma which other people, who perhaps have an equally shared view on states rights, do. I may be wrong. I may have a similar position to Senator Abetz on this issue. It seems to me that the Commonwealth does have express constitutional power regarding its territories. Section 122 of the Australian constitution confers a power on the Commonwealth to make laws for the government of any territory. I am a states righter and a constitutionalist. It is sometimes very easy, in relation to states rights and human rights, to suggest that that somehow resolves a difficult dilemma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that it is important for a constitution to be supported and, if we wish to change it, that that constitution be changed in the appropriate manner. I have no difficulty on that issue regarding states rights issues. The Northern Territory is a territory. I know many people in the territory feel passionately about this issue, on both sides, but the Commonwealth does have a constitutional right in relation it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, I think that the Northern Territory is as populous as a single federal electorate&mdash;a bit more perhaps&mdash;and it has enacted a law which affects the rest of Australia. Patients have already come from elsewhere in Australia to access euthanasia under the Northern Territory's laws. So I do not find difficulty on the so&hyphen;called states rights issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the substantive issue&mdash;the appropriateness of the bill&mdash;one of the things which has turned my mind on this issue is that, in the first place, I have never met a doctor who has not explained to me that palliative care and the use of drugs can often shorten life. That, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in fact, occurs very regularly in the society as people seek to treat the sick and dying. I am not a medical doctor. My understanding is that it may not be satisfactory in 100 per cent of cases, but in the vast majority of cases there is, and should be, treatment for the sick and the dying to alleviate pain, and the use of drugs to alleviate pain will often shorten life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a vast distinction between what I regard as current practice and perhaps giving a lethal injection or ending a person's life in a precipitative manner. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report suggested that the intention is the key factor and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dying is a natural process and all people have a right to refuse treatment. But that is not euthanasia. Nor is the administration of substances intended to alleviate pain and discomfort which have the `double effect' of hastening death.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Many believe that the current position which exists might be enhanced by legislation to legalise voluntary euthanasia. In the first part, it will only serve to vastly complicate the doctor&hyphen;patient relationship from one of healing and withdrawing treatment, perhaps where requested, to providing active assistance in suicide on request. Many doctors are quite rightly asking: what would flow from this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, Madam President, I find myself in some agreement with Senator Woodley about the slippery slope which he referred to. I am concerned&mdash;and one of my colleagues who raised this with me some time ago may well have spoken on this&mdash;that the right to die provided under the Northern Territory law may well turn into a duty to die. That is the slippery slope to which I do not propose to lend any weight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Death and particularly of death from a prolonged disease or injury has a devastating effect on families. No-one would deny that. It arouses quite appropriately huge emotions. There may be tragic cases&mdash;and other speakers have given examples of these&mdash;where undue pressure might be applied on patients so that they feel that they do not have the right to die but a duty to die.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that this is an important debate and it is appropriate that this parliament engage in this debate. This debate 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1732"> has been conducted in a fashion which I have not seen before in this parliament and which I certainly welcome. Senators can reflect on this very serious and weighty problem and come to a conclusion, and perhaps a conclusion which differs from their colleagues, but nonetheless respect for different views is retained. For those reasons, I will be supporting the Euthanasia Laws Bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are five principal points which I wish to outline in relation to the Andrews bill. Firstly, I will be voting against the Andrews bill. Secondly, I believe the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act contains the proper safeguards for both terminally ill patients and medical practitioners and so deserves my support. Thirdly, I accept that, as the constitutional laws of Australia now stand, the Northern Territory has the right to draw up and pass legislation dealing with the life and death of its citizens. The Commonwealth does indeed have the right to overturn their legislation. If the Northern Territory were a state the Commonwealth would not have that right. This is a strange anomaly for our citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, I do not agree that the states and territories should have the power over life and death. I think that the Commonwealth constitution is the only place in which the absolute human rights and obligations of Australians should be determined. Issues such as control and power over life and death should be solely within the prerogative of the Commonwealth. They are not at present. Fifthly, the forthcoming constitutional convention provides the perfect opportunity for the power over life and death to be raised and considered as a possible amendment to the Commonwealth constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Control and power over life and death is a most fundamental matter. One thing this euthanasia debate has emphasised, apart from the tolerance and civility of our society when encountering issues as deep and as serious as these, is that society does deeply value life and is deeply engrossed by death. Neither war nor capital punishment nor abortion nor birth policies can ever be dealt with without the upmost gravity and care.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Medical and scientific advancements have enhanced the opportunity for previously infertile couples to reproduce, which is a control over life. Equally important advancements in medicine have enabled medical practitioners to considerably prolong the life of patients, including terminally ill patients. These medical achievements have led us to question the use of drugs to control the time of death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Considerable research, statistical evidence and studies reveal that both passive and active euthanasia is widely practised in Australia. This is despite a lack of comprehensive legislation in all states in the case of passive euthanasia and despite illegality in the case of active euthanasia. All Australian jurisdictions make some sort of provision for dealing with passive euthanasia and for dealing with suicide. In two states and the Australian Capital Territory there is legislation which sets out guidelines for the withdrawal or withholding of treatment for terminally ill patients. There are also common law rights which make some provision for patient control over death. Essentially, it is legal for a competent adult to refuse medical treatment at common law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Active voluntary euthanasia however is criminally sanctioned in law. It is a criminal offence in all Australian states and territories to deliberately act to bring about the death of a person. For as long as the practice and beliefs of medical practitioners and Australian citizens who practice euthanasia remains inconsistent with existing law, it undermines our legal system and denies us the opportunity to debate the ethics of this issue. It also generates a climate of secrecy which is inherently risky for all parties. If we continue to pretend that active euthanasia is not already practised, we will be denying ourselves the opportunity to debate the ethics and to set standards and limits that may be legally sanctioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, active voluntary euthanasia is something akin to prostitution in our society&mdash;we know it goes on but many like to pretend that it does not. With euthanasia such a climate is conducive to risk: firstly, for medical practitioners who may be subject to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1733"> prosecution, although the courts have generally treated so&hyphen;called mercy killers with considerable leniency; secondly, for patients who may be coerced into assisted suicide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I have real worries about active voluntary euthanasia, I have a very strong belief in the right of an individual to voluntarily choose their own destiny. I am therefore willing to support a system which is carefully constructed and establishes proper safeguards for those involved. I believe that the Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act satisfactorily enacts safeguards which protect both the terminally ill patient and the medical practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of our federal structure, control over issues of life and death is given to both the states and the Commonwealth. The power over life and death that our governments can exercise concerns six areas. Only one of these is the sole prerogative of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those six are: firstly, war&mdash;the Commonwealth has a sole prerogative there; secondly, capital punishment&mdash;that can be exercised by both the Commonwealth and the states; thirdly, abortion&mdash;Commonwealth and states; fourthly, euthanasia&mdash;Commonwealth and states; fifthly, birth control, such as contraception or methods of population control&mdash;Commonwealth and states; and, sixthly, birth promotion, such as IVF&mdash;both Commonwealth and states. Under the present Australian federal constitutional system, we cannot avoid the fact that states and territories do have the power to legislate on these issues. Their constitutional power has to be recognised and accepted. This is not to say that I would be reluctant to contemplate a constitutional change to this power, far from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, in Australia&mdash;with its small population and fairly homogenous society&mdash;fundamental human rights issues, such as control and power over life and death, should be solely within the province of the Commonwealth, not the states or territories. I would welcome, therefore, a referendum or constitutional convention to change the situation by placing fundamental human rights prerogatives within the exclusive preserve of the Commonwealth constitution. It is our pre-eminent constitution. It is higher law. It does, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and should, stand above the subordinate and supporting and complementary constitutions of the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This objective should be pursued as part of the proposed amendments to the Commonwealth constitution to be considered at the constitutional convention in November this year. In this way, these rights and powers can be determined by the people of Australia by referendum. These sorts of matters have to be determined by the people, and in this way so could this issue of euthanasia.</PARA></SPEECH>

It can be the end of a cruel and protracted process during which pain and suffering sap our human resources and drain our will to live.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory of Australia passed the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act on 25 May 1995 and amendments were made to it on 28 June 1996. The statute gives a person facing a cruel and painful death the right to choose an easy one. He or she can have the help of a medical practitioner if that doctor is willing to provide it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Legislative Assembly possesses the power by which it passed the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 because of the Northern Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act, a statute enacted by the federal parliament in 1978. Four people have lawfully met their deaths pursuant to its provisions since 1 July 1996 when it came into operation, and in each case Dr Nitschke prepared the killing process. Now the Commonwealth legislature is debating the Euthanasia Laws Bill, which proposes to remove that power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Menzies, Mr Kevin Andrews, introduced a bill into the House of Representatives on 9 September 1996. The effect of the federal parliament passing it will be to override a valid exercise of power by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1734"> the democratically elected Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory and to make euthanasia a crime there no matter what the circumstances. There are good reasons for rejecting the Euthanasia Laws Bill. Are there better ones for passing it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The intentional killing of a human being is an elemental event. It is a momentous act. Its gravity should never be discounted. That it may be common in the world does not make valid its endorsement. Dying is more than a physical transformation for the individual facing death. Generally, the process evokes spiritual, cultural and social responses to it both from him or her and from a wider range of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any death is a communal concern. The manner of its coming influences society's perception of how things should be, of how its laws should operate, of how its culture should develop, of how people should live together and of how readily killing should be countenanced. John Donne wrote in 1624 that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No man is an Island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the Continent, a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friends or of thine own were; any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankind; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These words have been quoted again and again since they were written over 350 years ago. They have the ring of truth. On 14 May 1971, in delivering his decision in an action by the state of Victoria against the Commonwealth, the Chief Justice, Sir Garfield Barwick, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have observed elsewhere that the Constitution does not represent a treaty of union between sovereign and independent States. It was the result of the will and desire of the people of all the colonies expressed through referenda to be united in one Commonwealth with an agreed distribution of governmental power.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus though by their union in one Commonwealth the colonists became Australians, the territorial boundaries of the former colonies were retained for the purposes of the distribution of governmental power and function. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Unlike those regions which are now states, the Northern Territory was never a self-governing colony which entered into a process to federate with the others and in so doing surrendered powers to the Commonwealth. It has never been the subject of an enactment pursuant to the provisions of section 121 of the constitution. Its status, though great, is less than that of the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 148 seats in the House of Representatives, any one of which contains approximately the same number of voters as do any of the others. In the Northern Territory, there are enough electors to justify it having one member in Canberra. These are the same limited number of people&mdash;and good people&mdash;who choose the Legislative Assembly, which passed the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995. That legislation has grave ramifications for all Australians. Given this, should the democratic rights of all voters throughout the Commonwealth be treated as subordinate to those of the relatively few who live in the Northern Territory?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The specific entitlement of territorians to self&hyphen;government rather than their general democratic rights may provide the strongest argument for rejecting the Euthanasia Laws Bill. Where the Commonwealth parliament has for two decades encouraged in territorians the reasonable expectation that they are to be masters of their own fate, some may argue that it has exercised an arbitrary power when it in effect vitiates an act passed by their assembly. There are reasonable and compelling reasons for the federal legislature to act on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Rights of the Terminally Ill Act deals with a central issue of life, namely, whether anybody should ever be allowed to bring it to an end by an act of intentional killing and, if so, under what circumstances. Within the Northern Territory itself, there is great unease and contention engendered by the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. Its second reading was delivered by a margin of a single vote. A great proportion of the indigenous people there are much disturbed by it being part of the law under which they live. And so are many from other communities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1735">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee held an inquiry into matters to do with the euthanasia bill. It and its secretariat have done much to ensure that the present debate is a good and fruitful one. They deserve thanks for their outstanding work. The inquiry showed that expert opinion both in Australia and throughout the world is fundamentally divided on the merits of euthanasia. People generally are riven over the issue. Given this, it is poor public policy to have the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act operating in the Northern Territory as near lone legislation existing anywhere in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Northern Territory assembly passed the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995, no medical practitioner there nor anywhere else in Australia was facing prosecution for any offence allegedly committed by him or her in facilitating euthanasia. As far as is known, none was under investigation in respect of such a matter. This is in spite of evidence put before the Senate committee that medically assisted euthanasia has occurred on a significant number of occasions in contemporary Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prosecutors hold a discretion as to whom they will proceed against. On 13 September 1996 Mr Rex Wild QC, the Director of Public Prosecutions in the Northern Territory, gave advice to the Attorney&hyphen;General about the euthanasia bill. It contained the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a matter of strict law, no medical practitioner would be entitled to involve himself in any way with a conscious decision to allow a patient to die if the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 is invalidated. That is not, as I understand it, the intended result of the Northern Territory Legislation. In what circumstances a prosecution would be launched, given the width of the prosecutorial discretion, is another matter.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Since Bushells case in 1670, juries have had a constitutional right to return the verdict they consider appropriate. They are judges not only of the facts but also of whether or not in all the circumstances a crime has been committed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context of the present debate, prosecutorial discretion and juries provide better means of dealing with hard cases than 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> does legislation. Of course I do not support euthanasia in any event, but where hard cases are put forward it is to be remembered that, for those who do believe in euthanasia, then in the interests of good public policy it is better for those cases to be dealt with by prosecutors and juries rather than by legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A statute of any parliament giving state approval to an act of deliberate killing is a chilling instrument. I would like to emphasise that. Where the state chooses to give sanction to killing and where we as legislators approve of that, then there is a sea change in the sort of society we legislate for. Legislative creep is a common occurrence. As a number of speakers before me have said, there is too high a risk of it happening in the present instance to allow the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I give some examples of where there has been legislative creep in this parliament over the years. In the chamber I see Senator Patterson who, I must say, in the face of my opposition, raised questions about how the tax file number would be used and how the Australia card might spread if it or something like it were to be allowed. I thought it could be confined and I think Senator Patterson would agree that the tax file number is more and more commonly used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example is the spread of the use of telephone tapping. We were assured when I first came into the parliament that if we allowed a particular authority to use it, it would not spread beyond that. It has spread, and the use of tax file numbers and telephone tapping is now accepted much more readily than when legislation allowing them was introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A goodly proportion of Australian citizens including me hold religious, cultural and social beliefs which reject euthanasia. A person's stance on a particular matter should not be labelled invalid simply because it is based on his or her faith. Faith can engender wrongs and injustices but it has underpinned some of history's paramount civilisations, much of its pre&hyphen;eminent art and science, and a great deal of its prime law. In the present instance, I see my beliefs in respect of eutha 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1736"> nasia as meeting the demands of good public policy. In other words, I am saying that my instincts, the whole of my being, if you like, revolt against the idea of euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot allow that to be the sole factor in deciding whether or not I will vote for the Andrews legislation. But it is a starting point that I can use to then test my beliefs against the evidence and against the situation as I find it. In this case I have found that the two coincide. I am reassured by that because this debate&mdash;when we look at it&mdash;is not between a group of people who say that whoever wants to undergo assisted suicide can, and, on the other side, a group of people who say that that cannot be done. In other words, the debate is not between those who would allow assisted self&hyphen;killing and those who would not. It is between those who would allow it in a very limited class of cases and those who would not allow it at all. That reassures me because it is not only my instincts but the instincts of nearly everybody who will take part in this debate tonight that people should not be allowed to surrender their lives too readily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we really believe that people should have a choice to die, why should we not allow the young and the healthy to die and to have people assist them? And why should that assistance be confined to the doctors? Why should that assistance not be given by whoever is an efficient death dealer? When you look at the principles that are in contention here, we are not talking about broad rights. People here are not saying, `There should be a right to die; there should be a right for people to kill themselves; there should be a right for people to assist others to kill themselves if they so want.' That is not what people are saying. They are saying that in a very limited class of cases there ought to be a right to die.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people are saying that then it means that everybody in this debate gives great value to life. It means that everybody in this debate believes that there ought to be protection of other people's lives even when those other people want to kill themselves, except in a very limited number of cases. If people do say that the sanctity of life is such that it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should be protected even where the young and the healthy want to kill themselves then why do they draw the line where people are terminally ill? And why do they draw the line for people who are sane, who have a self&hyphen;perception? This bill, as Senator Murray says, is a very restrictive bill. Why is this bill restrictive? It is restrictive because people are frightened, people are scared, people are terrified that if this thing is allowed to get away where is it going to end?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People are struggling to define where they will allow self&hyphen;inflicted death to occur. This very narrow, confined permission is itself perhaps the greatest argument against any death being permitted under the circumstances where somebody assists the suicide of somebody else. I will be interested to see if those following me in this debate get to their feet and say, `This is a universal right; anybody should be able to kill themselves, and anybody who is willing to help him or her do that should be allowed to do it and there should be no ramifications.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits provided by the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 are far outweighed by the good which will come from its invalidation. The Senate ought to give passage to the Euthanasia Laws Bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Euthanasia Laws Bill and its effect, if enacted, on the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act call for a dispassionate examination of two fundamental principles that lie at the heart of the kind of society in which Australians wish to live. First, there is a moral question. Second, there is a legal question. The first question calls for reconciliation between the rights of an ordered, principled society to ensure that human life is not deliberately extinguished, and the autonomous right of an individual to bring to an end a life which for medical reasons is unendurable. That such a person has a legal and moral entitlement to bring his or her own life to an end is unquestionable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public policy question is whether society should permit a consenting person who is unable to end his or her own life to request and obtain the assistance of another person to terminate their life. As a matter of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1737"> public policy, the state has an overwhelming interest in protecting the weak, the vulnerable and the differently abled&mdash;sometimes described as a burden on society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a pluralistic and diverse society life is not protected at any cost. For example, most Australian states have enacted legislation dealing with brain death. At common law, patients have the right to refuse medical treatment even if that treatment may prolong life. Medical treatment can be withdrawn or withheld from both competent or incompetent patients if that treatment is futile or burdensome. It is assumed by health workers and families involved that doctors are not acting unlawfully if they administer pain relieving drugs to a terminally ill person which have the so&hyphen;called double effect of hastening the death of the patient, provided the intention is to alleviate pain and not bring about the patient's death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Advances in modern palliative techniques are truly impressive, and if readily available meet the needs of most terminally ill patients for an easeful death. Although views differ as to whether palliative care is universally successful in alleviating pain and distress, it may be assumed for the purposes of argument that there are a small number of dying patients&mdash;said to be between two and five per cent&mdash;in unendurable physical or physic pain that palliative care cannot sufficiently ease. Amongst that number are those who wish to be killed deliberately and rapidly within the confines of the law rather than being allowed to die more slowly within the existing pragmatic framework of palliative care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Assuming once again for the purposes of argument that sufficient safeguards could operate to protect the vulnerable and that consent is fully informed and freely given, the question is whether society should yield to that expression of individual choice or whether we as a society are justified in denying to a few fellow citizens assistance for the form of relief they seek. Are there risks to society collectively that outweigh individual freedom of choice to end a life in this manner? I have come to the view that extending end of life options to include a formal regime for voluntary euthanasia or physician assisted suicide 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> does pose appreciable risks to the way our society is presently ordered and is not in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can readily appreciate that when confronted with the question, `If a hopelessly ill patient in great pain, with absolutely no chance of recovery, asks for a lethal dose so as not to wake again, should a doctor be allowed to give a dose or not?', a great number of Australians would answer `Yes'&mdash;motivated, as most of us are, by compassion for the hopelessly ill and the desire to alleviate individual suffering. For law makers, however, the proposition that deliberate killing if certain conditions are fulfilled should be excepted from the general prohibition against murder raises broader implications for society than does endorsing the right to freedom of choice of a small number of individuals who want assistance to hasten their own death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The law moulds and shapes values and attitudes as much as it reflects and reinforces those values. To legally sanction a regime for terminating human life challenges the ethical underpinnings of the law which strenuously protects human life. It sends a powerful message that some human life is not worthy of that protection. Legally accommodating that small number of persons who are able to give fully informed and voluntary consent to have their lives terminated in circumstances where palliative care fails them has to be measured against the safeguards that can be imposed to ensure that others do not submit to euthanasia involuntarily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The class of potentially vulnerable people are a large percentage of those suffering terminal illness who are too young, too old, too feeble, too much afflicted by inappropriate family pressures or not mentally competent to comprehend the variety of choices available to them. Most poignant of all is the plight of the terminally ill who could be assisted by a trained palliative care team but who, due to geography, finances, scarce facilities or even cultural barriers, such as those confronting Aboriginal communities, do not receive adequate palliative care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opinions differ as to whether the act imposes sufficient safeguards so that only those 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1738"> who expressly choose euthanasia will receive it. However, a fundamental premise of society  that regulates our legal and social relationships is that we may not kill intentionally or even negligently without being visited with severe consequences and the disapproval of society. The House of Lords Select Committee on Medical Ethics observed that the effect of the prohibition of intentional killing `protects each one of us impartially embodying the belief that we are all equal'. According to this principle, each human life has value, no matter how bleak the prognosis, how reduced the quality of that life or how pathetic individual circumstances may be. Each life is entitled to the full protection of the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An individual may decide for himself or herself that life is not worth living. But once society concurs, moral responsibility shifts from the individual to the collective. The way is then open for erosion of the legal premise that accords every life equal value and to allow others to substitute their own judgment as to whose life is worth living anyway. This potentially exposes those who cannot make informed decisions about their own quality of life choices to decisions being made for them based on subjective judgments and tacit assumptions of others as to what sort of life is worth preserving. American, E Grant, in his article <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercy killing&mdash;how America's courts have set the stage</EMPHASIS> contends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Decision making by substitute judgment has become so ingrained in American health care law that if active euthanasia is declared to be a right for competent individuals, it will probably be extended by this principle to the incompetent as well.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A revealing footnote I have found in one of the judgments involving doctor assisted suicide currently being appealed to the United States Supreme Court laid the groundwork for end of life decisions being made by others, thus:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A decision of a duly appointed surrogate decision maker is for all legal purposes the decision of the patient himself&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and should not be considered `involuntary'. The tendency to make substitute judgments has profound implications for people with disabilities, be they newborn or suffering progressive disabling disease, be they mentally incompetent or even in a coma. In a paper 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> presented at the Rights Ethics and Justice for People with Disability Conference last year, lawyer Jennifer Fitzgerald observed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is through society's growing willingness to make quality of life judgments that the lives of people with disability become endangered. It is through this willingness that people with disability lose protections, basic protections to their lives which other members of society enjoy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Whatever moral framework informs one's views about voluntary euthanasia, it would be patronising to say the least to impose those views on a fully informed, freely consenting, competent adult seeking assistance to die if, as a community, we could be confident about the effectiveness of legislative or other safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Dutch experience of a permissive regime for active voluntary euthanasia and its relevance in the Australian context has been the subject of vigorous academic debate and widely divergent views. What the Dutch experience does demonstrate, however, is the impossibility of effectively and safely regulating euthanasia in practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1995 review <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notification Procedures for Physician-assisted Death</EMPHASIS> in the Netherlands shows that most acts of euthanasia requiring strict compliance with guidelines are not reported. Official studies suggest that only 18 per cent were reported in 1990 and 41 per cent in 1995. For reasons that are not clear, it appears that assisting physicians report many deaths that have been brought about as a result of medical intervention to end the patient's life as being due to natural causes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever the true position, it seems uncontestable that a not insignificant number of lives have been terminated in the Netherlands without an explicit request from the patient. Of those terminated on request, there is no way of knowing the quality of that consent when the guidelines are simply not adhered to. If the Netherlands experience is any guide, a law permitting what is said by recent research to be a widespread practice in Australia will do little to encourage a transparent, accountable and open process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This prompts me to ask: how effective is a legal regime that seeks to impose objective criteria on medical judgments that are essen 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1739"> tially subjective, such as the doctor's intention in administering drugs to his or her patient? In that regard, there have been no criminal prosecutions of doctors in Australia in relation to administration of pain relieving drugs that have hastened death. Natasha Cica in her paper on active voluntary euthanasia notes that there has been no judicial clarification in the Australian context rendering doctors immune from liability for killing simply because the circumstances are characterised as ones where there was no intention to cause death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that, in this area of intensely personal and private behaviour governed by the subjective state of mind of the relevant doctor, it would be extremely difficult for a prosecution to succeed. This may well be an area of the law which is unenforced and, for all practical purposes, unenforceable. It begs the question whether, in any Australian state or territory, there is any purpose to be served by a legislative regime providing for active voluntary euthanasia that is likely to be followed more in the breach than the observance and that may not have much bearing on what end of life decisions are actually made in practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not convinced that legislation for active voluntary euthanasia is workable and safe. Whilst the terminally ill must be able to avail themselves of the greatest possible latitude in palliative techniques, when balancing the potential risks to the vulnerable in society&mdash;the elderly, the frail, the incompetent and the disabled&mdash;against the interests of those terminally ill patients who are insufficiently assisted by palliative care and also capable of providing fully informed consent to termination of their life, the majority should prevail. In coming to this conclusion I have relied on assurances from palliative care specialists that physical pain, if not all degrees of existential distress, can be sufficiently palliated in virtually all cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the legal question, there cannot be much doubt that the Commonwealth parliament has power pursuant to section 122 of the constitution to enact the bill which will remove the power of the ACT, Norfolk Island and the Northern Territory to enact laws to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> permit voluntary or involuntary euthanasia and will override the act. A more difficult question is: when is it appropriate to do so?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have difficulty with the notion that, despite the constitutional framework of the self&hyphen;governing territories, territorians should be subject to Commonwealth interference in an area where the states have power to enact comparable laws, and the Commonwealth's ability to override such laws would be, at the very least, restricted, if not invalid. It is foreseeable that, having outlawed voluntary euthanasia in the territories, if the bill is carried, one or more states will enact such a law that will be beyond the reach of the Commonwealth in any event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have reservations with the notion that, by virtue of my position as an individual in federal parliament, my conscience is somehow to be regarded as superior to, better informed than or one that in the circumstances ought override the consciences of other democratically elected representatives of a body politic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Conscious though I am of objections of territorians, I believe that legislating for active voluntary euthanasia is an exceptional measure, that it has the potential to affect people outside the jurisdiction of the territories and that where the Commonwealth has power it should govern in the interests of and to protect the lives of all Australians. I am satisfied in these circumstances the Commonwealth can and should intervene as an exercise of good public policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also taken into account claims that Commonwealth intervention will lead to legal uncertainty. I do not think that by overriding the act the legal position affecting conventional medical end of life decisions will be any less certain. For reasons I have mentioned, it is unlikely that such decisions will be affected in practice. Whilst it is clearly arguable that the expression `intentional killing', which the act prohibits and does not define, can be construed  broadly, probabilities favour the view that the expression `intentional killing' has a well defined and narrow meaning as enunciated in case law and will not interfere in conventional medical end of life decisions and would not lead to uncertainty. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1740">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most enduring legacy arising from this debate ought to be an understanding of the critical importance of good palliative care and a commitment to improving its availability to dying patients. If the bill is carried there will be nothing less than a moral imperative to improve the range of palliative facilities throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compassion means not only controlling pain but assisting patients holistically to maintain dignity, self-determination and courage. It means finding better ways to help patients whose suffering, characteristically, has not been amenable to palliation, such as those progressively disabled by motor neurone disease. It means funding palliative care where it is needed&mdash;in homes, hospices and hospitals. In short, it means a lot of taxpayers' money, especially as the population ages. The dictates of conscience demand nothing less. For these reasons, and, I must admit, not without a great deal of reflection, I support the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I value the opportunity to take part in a debate of such great importance, but I will not keep the Senate long. I wish only to make as clear as I can why I will vote as I intend. As many senators would know, in 1993 I was diagnosed with cancer for the first time. Associated treatment included radiation which was excruciatingly painful. Yet over several days I could get no relief from pain from a much vaunted pain control clinic. I mention this because the fear of pain is a major element in the move for voluntary euthanasia. We are told that better palliative care is the answer, and I am sure it is vitally important. I am all for better palliative care, but I do not accept that medical science has all the answers in pain control and I believe it is arrogant in the extreme for some doctors to make that claim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Questions of pain and pain control are not the only ones which exercise my mind, and yet they tend to dominate the debate. Someone I love very much will very likely die from choking to death. That thought is with me always. It cannot help but influence my 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> views. I know that if my family were to find an understanding doctor, we might be able to ensure that an overdose of a drug administered by a doctor for `pain relief' would give final release from a hideous and ghastly death. But I find that process quite dishonest and unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do some in our society accept that a doctor and/or the family has the right to decide the occasion of death by the use of a lethal level of pain&hyphen;killer and yet the law decrees that there is no such right of decision for the dying themselves? By its legislation, the Northern Territory has ensured that right for the dying rather than for their doctor or their family and, hence, has stripped away some of the hypocrisy which is implicit in the present situation. Society conveniently closes its eyes to what I would describe as the involuntary euthanasia which exists at present for those who are no longer able to make that decision. I find it amazing that many in the medical profession are unwilling to assist a dying patient who chooses to die with dignity, yet are willing to produce a similar result based only on their own judgment and the urging of the family. The territory legislation enables people to die with dignity, if that is their choice. It does not compel them to do so. It was enacted by the Northern Territory in a legitimate exercise of its legislative power. I recognise that the Commonwealth has the power to overturn the territory legislation, but it is not required to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have lived a long and an active life. I have twice gone under anaesthesia for serious surgery. Inevitably, each occasion was a matter of deep soul&hyphen;searching and caused me to focus more than ever before on my own mortality. My continuing good health is a matter of great joy to me and to my family. I thank God for it and I hope it may long continue. But, if a day comes when I am facing a long and painful death and am still of the view that I hold today, I wish to have the right to knowingly choose the time of my death and the circumstances in which I die. Even more so, I passionately want to have that right for those I love. The Northern Territory has lawfully given that right to Australians and it has been hedged about with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1741"> proper safeguards. I only wish that right was more readily available to those of us who live in the rest of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, we are each guided by our own personal beliefs and values. Last night in the debate, the question was raised as to who&mdash;outside this chamber in wider Australia&mdash;is in favour of legalising euthanasia, because we have all received correspondence, particularly those of us who are against legalising euthanasia. In answer to that question, I would say that the people who make up the numbers of the surveys we read about in the newspapers are those who have had first&hyphen;hand experience of the agonising or desperately undignified death of somebody near and dear to them and those many older Australians who have already received a diagnosis of a terminal illness and know that in time they themselves will be facing a very difficult death. They tend not to be members of organisations and, thus, their views are not so easily heard, particularly by members of parliament and in letters received, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that many people hold views opposed to my own. I respect their views. I ask only that they respect my conscientiously held beliefs. My beliefs have been arrived at over time and through my experience of life as I have found it. They are heightened by the needs of those I dearly love.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prohibition of intentional killing is the cornerstone of law and of social relationships. This prohibition protects each one of us impartially, embodying the belief that all are equal.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So said the House of Lords Select Committee on Medical Ethics. I respectfully concur. If we reject the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996, we will, as a Senate, be signalling to all the world that we wish to diminish that fundamental and impartial protection. My standpoint is unambiguously opposed to euthanasia. On a previous occasion&mdash;on 21 June 1995&mdash;I set out in this place the reasons why I oppose euthanasia. More recently&mdash;on 6 November 1996&mdash;I outlined to the Senate why states rights do not equate with territory rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is somewhat unfortunate that I need to repeat some of those comments, given some of the contributions in this debate. The simple 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fact is that the federal parliament was clothed with a power to legislate in respect of the territories. That power was suggested by the founding fathers and then given to us by the people of Australia voting in a referendum. They gave us no such power in relation to the states. Given that the people of Australia have not given us such a power in relation to the states, it is appropriate that we consider the differentiation between a state and a territory. Section 122 of the constitution makes that point very clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> For those who talk about self-government of the territories, let me simply remind this chamber that the self-government so-called is severely restricted. The Northern Territory is not allowed to legislate in respect of industrial relations, in respect of uranium mining and in respect of land rights. Every single act of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and indeed every regulation could be overturned by the executive pen of His Excellency in council. So it is very much a limited form of self-government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> While some may regret that one law applies in relation to the territories and another in relation to the states, the fact is that the people of Australia did not clothe the Australian parliament with such a power. That is why the proposal being mooted by Senator Bob Collins is not a fair dinkum proposal. I think everybody knows that the federal parliament does not have the power to make a euthanasia law in respect of all of Australia. But, if we have the power in respect of the territories, I think we have an obligation to consider the use of it in exceptional circumstances. Clearly, it is difficult to imagine anything more exceptional than euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let me say that I have found the contribution of senators promoting the concept of territory rights somewhat heart&hyphen;warming, and I say `somewhat' with a smile on my face. I wonder where you all were when the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill was being debated&mdash;when Tasmania's democratically enacted laws were clearly upheld by the people of Tasmania, and opinion poll after opinion poll was telling us that the people of Tasmania wanted their democratic rights protected? Where were they?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found it very interesting that Senator Brown in his contributions especially last night talked about the importance of territory rights and the democratically elected parliament. Who was the person who could not win the debate over the Franklin dam in his own home state of Tasmania? It was none other than Senator Brown. What did he do? He tiptoed off to Canberra to get the Commonwealth government to override the Tasmanian legislature. I think the comments made by the honourable senator last night just do not ring true, unless the seed of state rights and territory rights was always there somewhere in the embodiment of Senator Brown but only germinated of late. If that is the situation that has arisen, I welcome that change of heart and I look forward to its ongoing growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Some people have suggested that the Euthanasia Laws Bill will create a degree of uncertainty. Until judicially interpreted, the meaning of every piece of legislation has a degree of uncertainty. Even our constitution, which has been in existence for 96 years, is still the topic of argument in the High Court virtually every day of the week to determine what it actually means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similar criticisms can be levelled at the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995. Some would argue that under that Northern Territory legislation people diagnosed with diabetes, although they have the possibility of a 30-year life span or more, have an incurable disease and if those people do not want to avail themselves of the medication available because they find it unacceptable they would then be classified as being able to access that legislation. That argument was very validly put to us during the Senate hearings on this bill. So there is the uncertainty about the Northern Territory legislation as well.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only real and substantive argument in relation to uncertainty in the Andrews bill is in the term `intentional killing'. There are basically two approaches&mdash;the narrow approach and the broader approach. Whilst some witnesses argued for the possibility of a broad interpretation during the committee hearings, not a single witness put to us that that interpretation should be adopted. Indeed, the explanatory memorandum to this bill and the contributions to this second reading debate will ensure that the narrow reading of the term `intentional killing' will be adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will always be uncertainty. And if there is not&mdash;with respect to my profession&mdash;then lawyers will create it. So our collective minds should not be exercised overly about the possibility of uncertainty, but the degree of uncertainty. The evidence of Mr Dabb, who is First Assistant Secretary in the Criminal Law Division of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, is very instructive in this regard. He said to the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill has to me all the signs of being drafted with a high degree of professional competence and I would assume that expert legal advice has gone into the drafting of this bill. It seems to strike the right balance between simplicity and not becoming over complicated in trying to deal with every situation.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A more concerning argument exposing uncertainty is how one would codify the circumstances in which a life can be extinguished through euthanasia. Where a human life is at stake the possibility of uncertainty or possibility for mistakes ought be eradicated. Hence our rejection of the death penalty. Exactly the same principles apply in respect of euthanasia. As a lawyer, I have no doubt that misinformation is fed to courts despite all the checks and balances of our judicial system. Mistakes are made and if we had the death penalty, innocent people would meet their death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly with the euthanasia laws: when you have state sanctioned killing, what can arise? As Senator Herron pointed out very well last night, you can have misdiagnosis and people honestly believe they have a terminal illness, they are put into the terminal care ward, given 14 days to live and they, in fact, survive and live for another 19 years. People, being scared of the future they might 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1743"> face, will access that on the basis of a wrong diagnosis. A person with more than 20 years of life left in them may access this legislation on a mistaken belief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, we know of situations in hospitals all around the world where somebody goes in for, let us say, an appendix operation and comes out with an accidentally amputated foot. The medical profession makes mistakes. Are we ever going to countenance the possibility that there is going to be a medical mistake with euthanasia? I could not live with that on my conscience as I could not live with it in the event of the death penalty being misapplied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just indicate to you that after the Port Arthur massacre, where I lost a friend, I was very tempted to consider whether the death penalty should not be reintroduced. But I had to tear myself away from that personal experience, that personal emotion. It is very difficult to do that but you have to move yourself away and look at the principled position and say, `Is it an appropriate law just for this circumstance or for all circumstances?' That is what needs to exercise our minds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One issue that concerns me is the impact on the Aboriginal community of this country. It has been, I think, neglected in all those speeches in favour of the Northern Territory legislation. Today, I think, most honourable senators would have received a letter from the Northern Land Council pleading with us to support the Andrews bill because of their concern:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is already having a major effect on public health by increasing their&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the Aboriginal community's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">fear of accessing the health system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When you have somebody like Chips Mackinolty coming before you, you cannot help but be persuaded. It was simply overwhelming, a man who personally believes in euthanasia, who absolutely believes in it, a man who was appointed by the pro&hyphen;euthanasia Northern Territory government to conduct the education campaign among the Aboriginal community. He has 16 years of experience with the Northern Territory Land Council and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> other Aboriginal communities and was clearly a good choice. He believed in euthanasia, he had a good working knowledge of the Aboriginal community and he had good relationships with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After having conducted his education campaign he came to us as a committee and said, `Get rid of the legislation, override the Northern Territory because this is having a significant impact on the health of the Aboriginal community.' We heard some quite inappropriate&mdash;I will use temperate language&mdash;suggestions in the Northern Territory of churches being up to no good within Aboriginal communities. The evidence clearly was that even those Aboriginal communities that did not allow a single Christian into them were as vehemently opposed to euthanasia as those who had a Christian ethic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are genuinely concerned about the health of the Aboriginal community in this country, especially in the Northern Territory, that alone would be sufficient reason for us to reject the Northern Territory legislation and support the Andrews bill. Indeed, we were told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We had to tell people that at Tennant Creek hospital and at Alice Springs hospital nothing like this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">namely, euthanasia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">could ever happen, because we did not want people to decide that they were not safe at these hospitals. We had to tell them that it was only available at Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Aboriginal communities were deliberately misled as to the extent of this legislation to try to make them come to the outlying medical centres. But take the tip, as soon as euthanasia is committed at one of these outlying places, at Tennant Creek, Alice Springs or wherever, the Aboriginal community will say, `You lied to us; you misled us; we have no faith whatsoever in your Western medicine.' We all know, do we not, that the Aboriginal community in this country need as much support with their health as they can possibly get. To have some piece of legislation such as this that can really turn the Aboriginal community away from accessing those health facilities is a matter of great 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1744"> concern and something which ought be exercising our minds very heavily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time is slipping by. Let me quickly comment about the assertion that this is about the right to choice. There is no right of unfettered choice in this regard. Suicide is not a crime and we as a community spend millions of dollars trying to convince people not to commit suicide. We try to help them. The Rights of the Terminally Ill Act in the Northern Territory does not so much change the law for the patient as it changes the law for the doctor, the third party. The only thing that changes is that what currently is illegal for the doctor will become legal. That is nothing to do with personal choice; it has got everything to do with giving a licence to doctors to kill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And the unfortunate thing is that when I ask people&mdash;witnesses&mdash;about this so&hyphen;called right to die, all of a sudden they say, `Oh no, no, you have to put restrictions on it.' According to who? According to their values. But, supposedly, Christians and others in this debate are not allowed to put their values into the debate; they are not allowed to put them into the melting pot, but these people somehow are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no absolute right to die, according to these people. They say it has to be according to some sort of safeguard. What is the safeguard? That there is a third party involved. Do you know what that means? A third party has to make the decision and, along with the patient who has come to the conclusion that their life is no longer worth living, come to that conclusion as well and say, `I agree, your life is not worth living and that is why I am willing to inject you with a poisonous substance to kill you.' The concept that any human being can say of another, no matter what their circumstances, `Your life is not worth living' is something that goes against every strand of my being. It is something that I really, unfortunately, cannot relate to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you have the potential for guilt feelings for those that linger on&mdash;and Senator Harradine mentioned Sir Mark Oliphant's quite astounding, horrible and inhumane commentary&mdash;and when you have people such as the former Governor&hyphen;General Bill 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Hayden saying, `There is a point when the succeeding generations deserve to be disencumbered', to coin a clumsy word, `of some unproductive burdens', that is economic rationalism gone mad, is it not? Are we, as a Senate, going to say, `Yes, the views of Bill Hayden, Sir Mark Oliphant and whoever else are worthy of consideration?' They are abhorrent. They are abhorrent, because no matter what your circumstance, your life is precious and your life is worthwhile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concept of dying with dignity is something that I find very concerning in the context of this debate. To refer to various physical circumstances as being somehow involved with dignity is of real concern to me, because there is a disturbing equation between having dignity and being without disability. The term has been used as though there is a loss of dignity if someone who has previously been without disability takes on a disability in the course of a terminal illness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a lot of anecdotal evidence before us, but can I just finish on this note: no question as serious as euthanasia should be settled on individual cases; a general principle must be found which transcends particular cases. As with capital punishment, one principle which could be universally applied is that human life should be valued to the extent that puts it beyond the state. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many arguments have been submitted in the debate over the legalisation of voluntary euthanasia by the Northern Territory. This issue is one which has led to much consideration by members of this parliament and it is an issue that has led me to reflect on my clinical experience as a medical practitioner to assist me in reaching my conclusions about this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that the basic presumption underlying the Northern Territory euthanasia law is that the care of the terminally ill in this country is not adequate. Based on my own experience of some 27 years as a practising medical clinician, I have to say that I disagree with the presumption that the care of the terminally ill in Australia is deficient. I believe that, for the most part, the care provided for the terminally ill is satisfactory. It 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1745"> is my experience that the great majority of people with terminal illness have a peaceful death and just quietly slip away. However, I do recognise that there is a small percentage of so&hyphen;called hard deaths, said by those involved in palliative care to be about five per cent of all deaths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within recent years, I have experienced such a hard death from cancer in a member of my own family and I place that on record to make the point that I have personal experience of such sad events. Thus I am not just speaking from the detached view of a medical clinician or as a legislator concerned with matters of principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other speakers tonight have referred to the fact that polls show strong support for the Northern Territory euthanasia law. I suspect that much of the public support for euthanasia arises from fear of what the process of dying may involve in terms of discomfort and pain. In today's culture we do not talk much about death and dying; it is one of the great taboos of our society. Unlike those who lived in past times, modern people are not familiar with dying and death and so fear what death my involve and seek a mechanism whereby they may intervene and avert what they believe will be unpleasant events. However, I repeat that, in my experience, most people die peacefully and the techniques of palliative and terminal care ensure that there is little suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the argument that doctors do sometimes unnecessarily pursue futile treatments, I must point out that it seems to be often overlooked that patients do have a common law right to decline medical treatment. Terminally ill patients, or patients who have incurable diseases, are able, through the common law and through state and territory legislation, to request the withholding of medical treatment. The South Australian law entitled the Natural Death Act, or the Victorian legislation entitled the Refusal of Medical Treatment Act, are examples of laws giving the patient or patients the right to refuse medical treatment. These acts allow a patient to refuse futile treatment even if this treatment would prolong their lives.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important argument used by those who support the Northern Territory legislation is that the medical profession needs to be subject to regulation in the care of the terminally ill, both to protect society and to give doctors immunity from prosecution. Senator Brown used this argument tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ensuring that the process of dying for the terminally ill is not uncomfortable is the objective of palliative and terminal care. To that end, in my experience, doctors and nurses involved in the care of the terminally ill provide counselling, sedation and analgesia or pain relief. At times, part of the overall management of such patients involves shortening the period of dying, if I might put it that way. In my experience, this is achieved by passive means such as not aggressively treating a chest infection in a patient with lung cancer, so that the patient dies peacefully from pneumonia rather than from the sometimes hideous effects of the secondary deposits of cancer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also true that the medications used for sedation and pain relief may bring death sooner, but surely this is part of the accepted role of the physician in our culture and has long been accepted in the annals of case law as such. The legal situation is that, provided the actions of a doctor are basically concerned with treating the medical condition of the patient, there is no need for extra legal protection of doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the general issue of the need for society to regulate terminal care, I have to say that in our culture death is usually a private family matter and that neither the terminally ill person nor their family wants to have every step of the treatment program scrutinised by a committee. I think such regulation would be cumbersome, undesirable and unnecessary. My view is that physicians do what they do for the dying in good faith and on the basis of the ethical traditions of their profession. It seems to me that the interests of society are well served by leaving things the way they are and that there is no case for meddlesome regulations of the kind that others seem to feel are appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My chief concern about this law, however, is that it sets a precedent for state authorised 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1746"> killing of people. I have devoted a great deal of thought to the question of whether it is possible to establish permanent legal limitations to such state authorised killing. After much discussion with many people, including some eminent lawyers, I have come to the conclusion that it is not possible to establish such limits. It is because of the inability of the law to provide such limitations that I support the Andrews bill. It is my view that the sanctity of human life is one of the core values of our culture, and it profoundly concerns me that the chief effect of the Northern Territory legislation, undoubtedly, will in practice be to undermine that key principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Northern Territory legislation is limited to voluntary requests for assisted suicide by terminally ill patients, I am deeply concerned about the possible extension of the concept of state authorised killing to other categories of people such as the aged, the disabled, unwell babies and people with chronic illness of various kinds. That these concerns are not just hypothetical considerations is shown by the fact that the author of the Northern Territory legislation, Marshall Perron, is now on the public record as saying that he believes that in due course the legislation should be extended to quadriplegics and people with diseases such as multiple sclerosis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Senate inquiry, Professor Helga Kuhse of the Monash Medical Ethics Centre, when asked about extending the categories of people defined in the Northern Territory legislation, said that she thought in 20 years or so, when there had been time for cultural acceptance of euthanasia, the categories of persons who are eligible for euthanasia could be extended beyond the terminally ill, as is provided for in the current Northern Territory legislation. It is my view that it is not too much to say that the authors of the Northern Territory legislation&mdash;and I include Professor Kuhse and the Monash Medical Ethics Centre among the spiritual authors of this legislation&mdash;see the present legislation as just the first step and have clear intentions of extending state authorised killing to other categories of people.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Kuhse has long been an advocate of euthanasia, and it is important for senators to know that she does not regard respect for the sanctity of human life as a fundamental tenet of a civilised society. I quote from her writing in 1985:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the doctrine of the sanctity of human life as understood in the Western tradition since Christianity prevailed is not in any sense a fundamental tenet of a civilised society.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One would have to describe this as an interesting point of view and at variance with accepted concepts of civilised society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In considering my position on this matter, I have been very mindful that both the UK and Canada have rejected the idea of introducing legislation for voluntary euthanasia. The parliaments of both the United Kingdom and Canada came to the conclusion that it was not possible to limit the extent of state authorised killing once the basic principle had been established and the precedent set. The December 1993 report of the House of Lords Select Committee on Medical Ethics stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we do not think it is possible to secure limits on voluntary euthanasia. It would be impossible to frame safeguards against non-voluntary euthanasia if voluntary euthanasia were to be legalised. It would be next to impossible to ensure that all acts of euthanasia were truly voluntary, and that any liberalisation of the law was not abused.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The 1994 report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is insufficient reason to weaken society's prohibition of intentional killing which is the cornerstone of the law and social relationships&mdash;it protects each one of us impartially, embodying the belief that we are all equal.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The evidence from other countries of legislating for euthanasia suggest that there are inadequate safeguards for removing potential sources of abuse. The slippery slope argument suggests that once euthanasia is permitted on a small scale, it will become more acceptable, hence the categories of those permitted to use euthanasia will widen. A witness from the House of Lords inquiry suggested that once active termination of life is a matter of choice for the competent people in society, the grounds for excluding non&hyphen;competent people from such treatment becomes harder to defend. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1747">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The law is not very adept at categorising people. It is equally not competent in providing checks on such categorisation. How can anyone be 100 per cent certain that such safeguards had been adhered to? If a person has died from a lethal injection and suspicions arise as to whether this person fitted the category deemed legal for euthanasia to be carried out and consented to, how could such a situation be rectified after the act had been done? After all, the patient would be dead and unable to answer any questions on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One must consider the experience in Holland, the only country in contemporary times where euthanasia has been condoned. According to Dr Williamsen, speaking in a recent debate on ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Late Night Live</EMPHASIS> program, there are now at least three incidents of involuntary euthanasia in Holland every day, that is, euthanasia without consent. In the program, Dr Williamsen, who is a Dutch doctor and a researcher in this field, said that he did not regard three acts of involuntary euthanasia a day as many. When you think about it, it is just about 1,000 or so people a year being put to death by lethal injection without consent&mdash;that is my interpretation, of course, not Dr Williamsen's. I find the admission about what is happening in Holland very disturbing, to say the least.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What might be the situation 30 years or so from now in Australia if the Northern Territory legislation is allowed to stand? In evidence before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, Professor Helga Khuse stated that she envisages that by that time the laws authorising euthanasia could be extended to sick babies. What about the disabled? In the same <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Late Night Live</EMPHASIS> debate that I referred to earlier, a paraplegic Canadian woman spoke of how vulnerable and defenceless the disabled would become if euthanasia were accepted by society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to say a little more about the possible impact of legalised euthanasia on the disabled. At the end of last year, a Canadian academic, Dr Gregor Wolbring, visited Canberra. He is a well&hyphen;respected academic mathematician and was also a thalidomide baby. He has no legs and only poorly formed hands, so he has to get around in an electric chair. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> He made the point that in modern society he would never have been born because his mother would have been pressured to terminate her pregnancy, and, if the Northern Territory legislation had been in force for some time and the killing of unwell babies had become culturally acceptable, he would have been given a lethal injection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who are born with disabilities usually do not see life in negative terms but as a challenge to overcome their disabilities and to do the things they want to do. The world is better off giving disabled people the opportunity to enjoy their lives rather than introducing the possibility that disabled people in general will simply be killed as a matter of routine because it is assumed that their lives are of no value, as the Canadian woman on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Late Night Live</EMPHASIS> feared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the elderly in nursing homes and those with chronic psychiatric and other illnesses who need a lot of nursing care? One can imagine that in an era of cultural acceptance of euthanasia, those who administer health budgets will find the option of the $30 lethal injection more attractive than the $20,000 or $30,000 annual recurring cost of institutional care for such people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summing up, I support the Andrews bill chiefly because I believe that, were the Northern Territory legislation allowed to stand, it would lead to an undesirable change in the fundamental tenet of our society of respect for the sanctity of human life and that this in turn could lead to the kind of undesirable outcomes I have referred to in this speech. I urge my fellow senators to think beyond the immediacy of the sad stories of the small percentage of so-called hard deaths and give consideration to the broader long-term implications for our society that would follow if the Northern Territory legislation were to stand. I urge my colleagues to support the Andrews bill and strike down this pernicious Northern Territory legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in opposition to the private member's bill on euthanasia currently before the Senate. This bill is about rights&mdash;the rights of the territories to pass and enact legislation and the rights of terminally ill 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1748"> people who, in full possession of their senses, choose to end their lives with the dignity they deserve. It is also very much about choice&mdash;the choice made by people who are suffering prolonged pain, in full knowledge of the agony they will endure until their death, of accepting or rejecting voluntary euthanasia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the proponents of the Andrews bill talk about palliative care. It is made out to be the ultimate answer to anyone suffering from a terminal illness. This is not always the case. From my readings, I have found that terminally ill patients rarely request euthanasia. Palliative care has made many advances and can control the pain and other distressing symptoms of many such patients. However, there are still many conditions and illnesses for which pain and extreme suffering are either difficult or impossible to eliminate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The suffering of the terminally ill is not always in the form of physical pain. It can also mean the impairment of all mental and physical bodily functions, paralysis, uncontrollable breathlessness, inability to swallow, continual choking and complete and utter dependence on others. Suffering from a variety of these symptoms and the knowledge that you have a limited time in which to live can be unbearable. Palliative care, no matter how progressive, cannot alleviate this type of suffering. It also needs to be remembered that the government, in the last budget, cut palliative care funding by 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an absolutely ridiculous situation where a doctor can legally give a patient pain&hyphen;killing drugs, even where the administering of the drugs is known to speed up the death of the patient, yet to administer treatment at the patient's request, with the direct intention of terminating the patient's life, is considered to be murder. There is no law against a person committing suicide. Yet the terminally ill, under this legislation, will not have any control over their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently spoke to a registered nurse from my home state of Queensland. She recounted details of terminally ill patients with intractable vomiting. These patients can go on with constant vomiting for months. At the same time, they are barely able to eat, speak or breathe. They are so weak that they cannot 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> even clean their own faces. No&hyphen;one on either side of this debate would want to see anyone endure that sort of suffering. One can only imagine the stress and heartache of families watching their loved one go through this agony.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until now I have not spoken of the removal of the territory's power to make laws, and let's not pretend that this is limited to euthanasia. The passage of this bill will set a precedent that will effectively veto any real power which the territories have. It will leave the way open for a federal government to overturn any territories' legislation. While some have suggested that this will politically make territorians second&hyphen;class citizens, I would further suggest that we may as well begin dismantling the territories' governments, if this bill is passed, because they will effectively have no control over their own destiny. Today it might be the euthanasia laws that we are considering overturning, but tomorrow and in the future it could be laws on homosexuality, cannabis and abortion&mdash;the list goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we take some sort of high moral ground on this issue, it will not be long before we start looking at a whole range of other so&hyphen;called `important' or `crucial' issues. What self&hyphen;respecting aspiring politician would want to run for office for a position within a government where they cannot implement any policies that would go against the wishes of a federal parliament or a government of the day? We may as well appoint an administrative team to run the Northern Territory as well as the Australian Capital Territory. At least public servants would not try to implement too many of their own ideas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I started my speech by stating that this debate was all about rights. Choosing to end your life with dignity is a basic human right. When a person is diagnosed as terminally ill, it is the most important time for them to have access to that basic human right and to have a choice of dying with dignity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do we know that death is not a beautiful thing? If life on this earth is so unbearable, death is sublime. I have always believed in God or a superior being and I believe that we all have a certain time in this life and then our spirit goes home. This, of course, is tragic 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1749"> for those who are left behind, but our life is complete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, some would say that legislation is conservative. In fact, there is more scope for assisting a person to die under common law than there is under the Northern Territory legislation. Choosing to die within the confines of the legislation and all its safeguards would not impinge on the rights or choices of others. Quite the opposite, it creates an audit trail with procedures and safeguards so that a doctor cannot make any decisions in isolation and is not open to accusations of abuse. In contrast, the common law provides a much easier defence for doctors and is more easily abused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, legislation enacted by the Northern Territory will make it more difficult for euthanasia to be carried out, rather than easier, which prompts the question: why are so many against the legislation? The Northern Territory legislation is a desirable alternative to the present system where doctors often make life and death choices for terminally ill patients, without proper safeguards because of concern about the legal consequences if they openly canvass such options. The Northern Territory legislation curtails some of the things that doctors practice now, and, I might add, often without discussing it with the patient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, the laws in the other states and territories are regularly ignored by both medical professionals and the authorities. Ostensibly, the laws are there to stop active voluntary euthanasia completely. The reality, however, is that doctors often do help terminally ill patients to die through the administration of drugs. Doctors who do so at the request of patients are not prosecuted even though they are helping someone to die. Some 2,300 deaths each year are the result of such voluntary euthanasia. There are also some 4,400 deaths per year caused by doctors who administer drugs with the express intention of ending a patient's life without any such request by the patient. These doctors are playing God and have completely taken away the most basic right of a patient.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The medical fraternity cannot bury their heads in the sand. Doctors do assist in voluntary and active involuntary euthanasia. However, there are no formal safeguards for the doctors or for the patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory legislation will protect doctors and the actions they might decide to take. It very cautiously gives terminally ill patients under certain defined circumstances the right to end their lives with the concurrence of three doctors. This is surely not opening the door to various forms of legalised killing that some are suggesting. It is regulating what is already happening and giving patients the rights they deserve. It is protecting patients and doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is bringing into the open what has been secretive and hidden for too long. It is bringing secretive practices under scrutiny and putting in place safeguards for the doctor and the patient. It brings the rights of the patient back to the patient and stops doctors from playing God. Ironically, it is the Andrews bill that is obscure and unclear. It has been badly drafted and does not define terms such as euthanasia, intentional killing, mercy killing or the assisting of any person to terminate his or her life. There was evidence to the Senate committee that there would be serious unintended consequences of this bill. I conclude by saying that I totally oppose this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Euthanasia Laws Bill is perhaps one of the most important pieces of legislation that the Senate has considered since Federation in 1901. The significance of this bill is reflected by the fact that every senator is able to exercise his or her vote in accordance with their respective consciences. In our political system this is indeed a rare occurrence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill deals with the question of euthanasia and, as such, it sets out to override the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 which came into force on 1 July 1996. Since that date a number of people have terminated their lives in accordance with the legislation. The bill, which has become 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1750"> known as the Andrews bill, also precludes the governments of the Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island from enacting similar legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the Andrews bill for reasons which I shall now outline. The bill was overwhelmingly supported by the House of Representatives. On 7 November last year it was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which, at that time, I had the privilege to chair. The committee received 12,577 submissions, which is a record for any committee of the federal parliament. The committee conducted a number of hearings in both Darwin and Canberra and witnesses included representatives of territory governments, Aboriginal groups, lawyers, doctors, Christian churches and representatives from groups opposing and supporting voluntary euthanasia. The submissions were extensive with over 93 per cent opposing euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I continue, let me pay tribute to the work of the committee secretariat, and in particular the secretary, Neil Bessell, who I note is in the chamber tonight. May I thank the secretary and his staff who worked untiringly on this report which I believe comprehensively covers the issues. I commend the report to the Senate and reject strongly any criticism in relation to the work of the committee. That criticism is totally unfounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill raises constitutional, legal, political and moral questions. At the outset, let me deal with them in order of complexity and importance. Firstly, I will deal with the constitutional aspects of this bill. Throughout this inquiry the question was raised as to whether the Commonwealth government had the power to pass this legislation. The territories, which are yet to become states, derive their power to legislate from the Commonwealth. Pursuant to section 122 of the constitution, the Commonwealth has the power to override territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was overwhelming evidence before the committee that section 122 provided the legislative authority for this bill and indeed this point was conceded by the Northern Territory. In the final analysis there can be no doubt that there is a constitutional basis for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the legislation. Any objection to this bill in relation to comity between parliaments is one based more on convention and I will discuss this in the political context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I do, however, I will turn to the legal effects of passing this bill. The issues can be conveniently covered by these questions: will the Andrews bill achieve what it sets out to do, what effect if any would the bill have on existing legislation in the Northern Territory, and will the bill have any unintended consequences? With respect to the first and second questions, the evidence before the committee clearly indicated that the Euthanasia Laws Bill if passed would outlaw voluntary euthanasia in the Northern Territory. The bill would therefore achieve its objective. In relation to the second question, it would not affect any other Northern Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From evidence presented to the committee, it appears that the bill therefore will not have any unintended consequences. In short, as stated by officers of the Commonwealth Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, the bill is well drafted and will work effectively. There is no unforeseen consequence as far as the Northern Territory legislation is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was, however, some uncertainty expressed about the terminology used in the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995. To this extent, I would refer senators to the evidence adduced before the committee that supported the proposition that the Northern Territory legislation is in itself uncertain and capable of clarification only by judicial interpretation. On balance, I believe that the evidence was persuasive and highlighted potential flaws in the Northern Territory legislation. I am indebted to Senator Coonan for outlining in detail the problems with the terminology contained in that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now turn to the political context of this matter. In this area of consideration, we have the question of territory rights, concerns expressed by Aboriginal communities and the question of palliative care. Australia is a federation made up of six states and a number of territories. The constitution clearly provides the Commonwealth with various heads of power in relation to legislation whilst leaving 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1751"> the remainder to the states. Quite clearly, the territories are subject to Commonwealth legislative power, although since 1978 the Northern Territory has had self&hyphen;determination. As such, there is a general rule of comity between parliaments and, in accordance with convention, parliaments do not normally override each other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although I am a proponent of what has been termed state rights or, more appropriately, state responsibilities, the question of state rights does not arise in this instance and it is generally accepted that, should a state pass a law similar to that of the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth government would not have the power to pass a bill overriding such state laws. The position in relation to the territories is, therefore, quite different. In this case, the Northern Territory legislation is unprecedented and the matter before us deals with life and death. In the circumstances, I believe that the Commonwealth is entitled to pass the Andrews bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the issue of the Northern Territory's desire to become a state, and I might just touch on that. The evidence before the committee presented by the Northern Territory supported the proposition that, if passed, this bill would not impede the territory's quest to become a state. It is a quest to which I am sympathetic, I might add, and to the people of the Northern Territory I would say that the passing of this bill will not pose any obstruction to their quest to become a state. I think that is a very important point because there was some concern expressed about that and the evidence before the committee was overwhelming that that was not a problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now touch on some concerns dealing with Aboriginal communities. One of the terms of reference of the Senate committee concerned the views of Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. Senator Abetz mentioned the powerful evidence given by Chips Mackinolty in this regard. The committee heard convincing evidence that there was no place for euthanasia in Aboriginal culture. The committee heard evidence which indicated that, as a result of the Northern Territory legislation, Aboriginal people in the Northern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Territory had lost confidence in their health system. That is, they were afraid of that system because they believed it was involved in the taking of lives. I believe that, in view of that, that is indeed a very serious matter for the Northern Territory government to consider and perhaps one which should have been considered more carefully at the passing of its legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now turn to the question of palliative care, which received much attention during the committee's inquiry. Palliative care can involve the administration of pain&hyphen;killers with the intention of relieving pain albeit that death may result. This situation must be clearly distinguished from euthanasia where the intention is to kill. The government recognises the importance of palliative care and this week, in an interview on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) recognised this point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth provides palliative care funding to the states through two main sources: the palliative care program and Medicare agreements. Even though the Commonwealth made $55 million available to the states through the palliative care program between 1993 and 1997, some states did not take up their full funding allocation, hence the states underspent on the program by $8.5 million. As a result, a review of the palliative care program has been commissioned by the Commonwealth. The review is examining the effectiveness and appropriateness of the current services and it will advise on the future development and delivery of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the review, the Commonwealth has three national projects in train. These relate to palliative care data definitions, performance indicators and suitable standards for national accreditation of palliative care services. Of course, like any other health measure, palliative care must be looked at within the bounds of budgetary constraints. As stated earlier, this situation is unprecedented and political considerations need to be looked at in the context of the overarching moral concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most important aspects of the committee's inquiry involved the question of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1752"> the `slippery slope'. Dr John Keown, an international expert from Cambridge University, conducted extensive research into the law and practice of euthanasia in the Netherlands. From two studies conducted in 1991 and 1995 respectively, he concluded that voluntary euthanasia in the Netherlands had resulted in instances of non-voluntary euthanasia. The House of Lords Committee on Medical Ethics expressed findings consistent with Dr Keown after conducting its own inquiry into the situation in the Netherlands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Eggleston has just indicated eloquently how some regard the Northern Territory legislation as just a first step along the way, and that is one of the grave fears that I hold in relation to the Northern Territory's legislation. Voluntary euthanasia involves an individual terminating his or her life with the direct assistance of a third party. In accordance with the Northern Territory law, the state would sanction such a move. Albert Schweitzer once said that the mark of a civilised man was respect for life. The taking of life has always been looked upon by civilised society as a very serious thing indeed. Life is sacred and we must approach our daily lives on that basis. Of course, there are extreme circumstances where the taking of it is allowed such as in cases of self-defence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During this inquiry people have argued that our lives are our own and that we should have the freedom to choose. It was John Donne, the poet, back in 1624 who stated that no man was an island. He went on to say:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">None of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">All human beings have a vital concern in anyone ending their life. We should not have the ability, I believe, to treat our life as a commodity. We should not have the power to terminate our lives with the sanction of the state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sort of message would we be sending to the youth of this country who are experiencing one of the highest rates of youth 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> suicide in the world? Our guiding principle in all matters should be for the preservation of life. The sanctity of life must not be diminished.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the prevailing tendency is to value life only to the extent that it brings pleasure and well&hyphen;being, suffering seems like an unbearable setback, something from which one must be freed at all costs. Death is considered "senseless" if it suddenly interrupts a life still open to a future of new and interesting experiences. But it becomes a "rightful" liberation once life is held to be no longer meaningful because it is filled with pain and inexorably doomed to even greater suffering.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate do now adjourn.</PARA></PROCTEXT><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1752"><TITLE>Legal Aid</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to speak about concerns that I and many of my constituents have about the government's cuts to legal aid. Our legal system, like those in most democratic societies, does not automatically give its citizens justice; it gives people a chance at justice. And whether it is a reasonable chance or not depends on how easy it is to access the legal system and the support available to people to navigate and negotiate their way through that system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While some of my Senate colleagues and colleagues in that other place have made mention of problems facing the community as a whole as a result of these cuts, I would prefer to highlight the problems caused for people who are perhaps going to suffer the most as a result of the draconian slashing of the legal aid budget by the Liberal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is those in our community who are most at risk, who are not able to afford expensive lawyers, who are trying to escape domestic 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1753"> violence&mdash;and these are most often women&mdash;who will be the ones that suffer the greatest with the diminished access to legal aid. I know that many women's legal resources centres have written to senators and members highlighting the fact that over 30,000 women apply for domestic violence restraining orders in Australia each year and that about 60 per cent of these women have dependent children. Those figures perhaps highlight how terribly affected by these callous and short&hyphen;sighted budget cuts the women and children attempting to escape domestic violence are going to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia, Alastair Nicholson, has been quite scathing in his criticisms of the cuts to legal aid&mdash;and rightly so. More than half the people who come before the Family Court have legal aid assistance and, without a well resourced and effective legal aid system, equality before the law will become a principle of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legal aid provides an important safety net for many Australians who would not otherwise be able to get legal advice or representation. When you cut legal aid funding, you effectively cut access to justice and put at risk the rights of those in our community who already find the legal system difficult and out of reach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the last election, the coalition promised to maintain funding to legal aid, to match and extend Labor's good record on access to justice measures and to redress imbalances which disadvantaged women in the legal system. Well, obviously that was not considered a core promise by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) or the Treasurer (Mr Costello) or the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams), because we now see them slashing funding to legal aid by over $120 million over the next three years. The members of the government should be in no doubt that such drastic cuts will hurt the people that should actually be protected by government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is not just women's legal centres that have contacted me raising concerns about the cuts to legal aid. The International Commission of Jurists, the National Association of Community Legal Centres, the Lawyers Reform Association, the New South 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Wales Council for Civil Liberties and many more organisations have written to me expressing their outrage at the governments cuts. They also highlight a very important point&mdash;that legal aid is part of the provision of social welfare, and access to justice is a right of all Australians and should continue to be, regardless of the costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is perhaps an interesting point of comparison that the United Kingdom government presently spends $65 per capita on legal aid funding and Australia spends merely $13. The Attorney-General recently said on the ABC that legal aid should not be exempt from cuts in the budget process. Well, I say that there are some issues, like education, like health, like legal aid, that are so important and essential to all Australians that they should indeed be exempt from such cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe the Australian community will be very understanding or forgiving of a government that disregards and in fact discards many Australians in their time of greatest need&mdash;nor do I think they should be forgiving of the government. A government that so vigorously implements short&hyphen;sighted policies under the guise of budgetary responsibility will run the serious risk of the community being very short&hyphen;sighted about the government's future.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator Alston</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) It may be the case in some rural areas that after the year 2000 analogue AMPS will be the only terrestrial technology which provides mobile telecommunications coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To address the concerns of rural mobile phone users who currently receive an AMPS service, but who would not necessarily be within the radius of digital (GSM) coverage, the Government has obtained the in&hyphen;principle agreement of the carriers to retaining some AMPS spectrum in certain existing rural planned service areas. This spectrum will be retained until there is alternative technology for the delivery of mobile telephony with a reasonably equivalent quality of service and breadth of coverage available in that planned service area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A review of rural planned service areas will be conducted in 1999 to determine those areas in which spectrum will need to be retained. It is expected that normal commercial development of new services and technologies will achieve the desired outcome of providing alternative services to existing AMPS mobile phone users by the end of 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) At this stage it is not possible to identify the specific locations which will remain unable to receive digital coverage after the year 2000. The carriers are continually extending their GSM networks as well as enhancing their existing GSM coverage. Also, after 1 July 1997, there will be open competition in the telecommunications 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry. This environment will provide greater incentives for companies to provide services using the most appropriate technology, which in turn can lead to a greater choice for consumers and greater coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted in (1) above, a review of rural planned service areas will be conducted in 1999 to determine those areas which will not receive an alternative mobile service on the closure of the AMPS network. (As the review will only take account of those areas which currently receive an AMPS mobile service; it will not identify locations which are outside the coverage of both digital and analog services.)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) It is likely that some areas of Australia may never receive mobile coverage from digital or any other terrestrial technology, as approximately 90% population coverage accounts for only around 5% coverage of the land area of Australia. However, new satellite based systems using low earth orbiting (LEO) satellites are currently being developed. These will be provided on a global, rather than a national basis and are expected to be available from 1999 onwards. Current indications are that services provided using these systems will be considerably cheaper and will use much less cumbersome equipment than the present generation of satellite based mobile phone services. The services will operate with dual&hyphen;mode handsets, enabling the subscriber to switch to the cheaper terrestrial GSM service where available.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) There have been no detailed surveys of the exposure of the Australian population to radiofrequency radiation in the range 60 MHz to 3 GHz. Some specific measurements have been made by the Australian Radiation Laboratory and the Communications Laboratory. Those sample measurements taken around cell&hyphen;phone base&hyphen;station transmitters show that signal levels in publicly accessible areas around the transmitter are typically less than 1 W/cm2.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) I have been advised that the survey referred to was published in 1980 and hence predates much of the change that has occurred in telecommunications. Its relevance to current circumstances is therefore doubtful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) At present there is no data showing the proportion of the population in Australian cities exposed to levels greater than 1 W/cm2.
