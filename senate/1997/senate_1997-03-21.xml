<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Omit paragraphs (1) and (3).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">My amendment would bring us back to the agreed sitting routine for next week. My concern is that we are dealing with the extraordinarily important debate on the Euthanasia Laws Bill on Monday evening. For the first time since I have been in the Senate, those sittings are being left open&hyphen;ended, so that no matter how far we go into the night on Monday, we will sit, presumably, until that bill is dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern is that, if we go into the committee stage, if the second reading motion is successful, we might find ourselves in the situation where there will be great pressure to truncate the debate on what everybody in this place agrees is an extraordinarily important matter. We have agreed to sitting hours to allow the bill to be debated this week. It deserves to be debated and completed in the coming week. But I foresee this situation where there will be great pressure on senators to not contribute to the debate because it may be after midnight and going into the early hours of the morning. There is an expectation that we might sit all night on Wednesday as well to complete government business. I believe we can do better that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am well aware it is likely that the numbers are not here to allow this amendment to get through and I am not going to push the matter. I simply say that the democratic form should be at a premium for this Euthanasia Laws Bill. There is enormous public interest in it. It is going to be put last on the program. The vital final votes on it are likely to be very late at night, if not in the early hours of Tuesday morning. That means it is inaccessible to much of the listening public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We, as a Senate, feeling this matter is of critical importance to the whole country&mdash;and speaker after speaker has said that&mdash;ought to be doing better as far as the public participation is concerned. That is what I am defending here. That is what I feel strongly about here. I think Australians ought to be able to listen to this debate in their normal waking hours. They ought to be able to hear the finality of it, if it comes to that, in their normal waking hours. Moreover, I do not think we, as senators, ought to be under undue pressure to get it over and done with. It is more important than that. It deserves the fullest possible and easiest timing so that the debate goes to its full length.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are my concerns. I know I do not have the numbers, but I felt impelled to bring this amendment to the Senate to say we should stick to the agreement that we made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I understand from the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) that an agreement is to be struck that broadcasting of the debate on Monday night will go to the Northern Territory. There is a meeting on Monday morning about that. The Greens feel strongly about that. I know the Democrats do as well. I expect that, if there is any glitch in that, there will be an adjustment to the sitting on Monday. It is critically important that this debate be heard by the people of the Northern Territory. I do not think any scheduling that we make this morning should get in the way of an obligation we have to ensure that the Territory hears the debate on Monday night.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition, as a party, will be supporting the motion that stands in the name of the Manager of Government Business in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2126"> the Senate (Senator Campbell). Let me explain very briefly why.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is, firstly, a matter of government business. Senators in the chamber have negotiated the issue of debate on the Euthanasia Laws Bill to ensure that we deal with it in our Senate program in a way that enables senators to exercise their conscience on both procedural issues in relation to the bill and, obviously, the matters of substance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As far as the Australian Labor Party is concerned, both are matters of conscience. We have an opportunity here, via the mechanism of this particular motion that stands in the name of Senator Campbell, to achieve just that. In other words, as far as the Labor Party is concerned, at 9 p.m. on Monday it will be up to individual Labor senators to exercise their conscience on these matters. This is the only way this can possibly work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Senator Brown&mdash;or any other senator for that matter&mdash;wished to move that the Senate do now adjourn and if he wished to do that at approximately 11.30 p.m. on Monday, as far as I am concerned that would be a matter of conscience for Labor senators and they would exercise their vote not according to party discipline but according to their conscience. This gives Senator Brown or any other senator an opportunity to do that procedurally at that time or bring any other matter before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion gives senators the notice that they need that the matter of the Euthanasia Laws Bill will be before the parliament at 9 p.m. on Monday. It means everyone has the notice that is required to deal with the second reading of the bill and any second reading amendments that are before the Senate, and then to deal with the committee stage of the bill in whatever way they see fit. It is sensible; it is proper; and it ought to be supported, in my view, by the Senate. And it will be supported by Labor senators as a matter of party discipline. We are not going to have this particular matter intervened on government business in this way. It is an important principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason we were comfortable with this matter being dealt with on Monday night of this week&mdash;again as a matter of conscience&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">was that there was no more government business before the chamber. The Manager of Government Business had indicated that he had nothing to bring forward at that time, even though the Euthanasia Laws Bill was not scheduled to be dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> These are important distinctions that I think are properly brought before the chamber. As far as the opposition is concerned, we will support this motion. Each and every Labor senator, if he or she wishes, will be exercising their conscience vote on procedural and substantive matters from 9 p.m. on Monday onwards. That is our approach. It is within this framework that we have determined it appropriate to support the motion before the chair.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief on the matter. Senator Brown approached me last night concerning this question of an adjournment at 11.30 p.m. I understood him to be saying that he was going to propose something on Monday night for an adjournment at 11.30. I did not understand him to be suggesting that he was going to move an amendment at this stage. As the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Faulkner) has indicated, we are supporting this proposition. I just wanted to clarify those remarks.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I quickly indicate that the coalition will clearly not support the amendment moved by Senator Brown. I approached Senator Brown, as I did virtually all parties and Independents earlier this week, to seek to manage the handling of a very busy government business schedule and the euthanasia laws private member's bill. There was no agreement in relation to when the voting and potential committee stage of the Euthanasia Laws Bill would be dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was agreement that we would spend these past three nights debating the second reading only. The agreement was that we would have discussions as to when the final stages would take place. I initiated those discussions and I have had total cooperation from every senator in this place. I approached Senator Brown two nights ago, I think it was, and said, `If you have any problems with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2127"> these, please let me know.' Senator Brown&mdash;and I accept this&mdash;said he was unable to focus on this until late last night. He had not approached me until when he walked into the chamber this morning, even though he had indicated he had concerns at the whips meeting last night. So it is very hard to operate in a total atmosphere of consensus when communication breaks down a little like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that all senators who want to see the program managed cooperatively and sensibly have agreed that this is a good way to go. I welcome the support of the opposition. I indicate the coalition will be opposing this amendment and seeking support for the motion as it is presented this morning on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or is there something in this legislation that requires them to utilise existing structures&mdash;for example, electricity poles? It strikes me as being strange that we have a situation where 13 millimetres is exempt when they can go ahead and just string them up on their own poles.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is hard to imagine that telecommunications carriers would be wanting to put up new poles because, in a sense, they have already covered the country. If you remove the 13 millimetre diameter differentiation line, then they would not be able to continue to put telephone wires above ground unless it was with the approval of the state or territory planning bodies, and they would not have any power of appeal to the ACA. In other words, they would simply be required, unless there was approval to do otherwise, to have all telephony underground.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, this debate arises out of concern that new broadband cable roll&hyphen;outs would be visually offensive, although no-one has expressed concern about existing telephony. This would effectively say that replacing existing telephony or having further overhead telephony would be unacceptable as well. The purpose of having this 13 millimetre differentiation line is to say we can understand concern about new roll&hyphen;outs of broadband cable. We will draw the line where we think it meets that concern, so any overhead cabling of broadband after the transitional period&mdash;say, 30 September&mdash;would not be able to go ahead.' </PARA>

If you are asking me about the practical reality, as I understand it, even in country areas the great bulk of Telstra's roll&hyphen;out is essentially underground, but there are circumstances in which they still do have overhead cabling of telephony.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole debate has arisen in the context of the proposed dual roll&hyphen;out of broadband cabling. I know there are people such as Senator Margetts who would love to see everything underground no matter what the dimension. Obviously, electric power cabling is now caught up in the debate as well. But the reality is that this debate has surrounded the new roll&hyphen;out of broadband cabling which is thicker than traditional telephony, and it is on that basis that we have sought to distinguish between the two.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is correct. There will still be a necessity to get local government approval for all cables. The difference is that, for broadband, you will be able to appeal to the ACA. If this amendment is passed you will not be able to do that in relation to what in the relevant scheme of things is a less serious concern. In other words, you would have cable of a smaller diameter that you could not appeal about, but you would have cabling of a larger diameter&mdash;which is presumably in your terms even more offensive&mdash;and you would be able to go the ACA panel and appeal that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the indulgence of the chamber, could I say out loud what has already been said informally, that is, that it was the original intention of the government to allow 10 hours for this debate. We thought, in the scheme of things, that was fairly reasonable because, as you know, there is an inordinate amount of legislation in the pipeline. We have already 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2131"> gone now for close to 15 hours.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clearly understood that there are three competing models. I do not think for a moment that anything that is going to be said in the chamber will persuade people to somehow roll over and go for someone else's model. I may be overstating the case in relation to the government and the Democrats, particularly if one of their amendments goes down. They might then support the other. The reality is we are all fixed in position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand and respect the competing models, but I simply say that it seems to me there is a big opportunity here to truncate the debate in a sensible fashion. I understand people need to speak because it is clearly a pretty important issue. We have, after all, had a Senate inquiry which spent a lot of time on this issue. As you will recall, even on the Telstra (Dilution of Ownership) Bill more than half the submissions were on this issue. It has been explored exhaustively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand this is another opportunity, but I very much hope that we could keep the debate on the competing models to something in the order of half to three&hyphen;quarters of an hour because we have another 30 amendments in this area. Otherwise, we are simply going to find that the debating time will blow out unnecessarily in the sense that further debate will not throw any more light on the positions of the parties because they are essentially fixed in relation to this major issue. That is not the case on the smaller issues, and there is scope there for some sensible exchanges. On the big ones, I simply urge the Senate not to see this as an opportunity for yet another series of speeches when it is not going to make any difference.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To clarify the situation: I have never at any stage suggested that people should not know how everyone in the chamber votes. There are a number of occasions when it is obviously very important to have a division because the numbers are very close. The only time I have expressed concern&mdash;and I have done it in strong terms&mdash;is where we are confronted with a situation where it is clear that the numbers are overwhelmingly one way; where it is quite clear where everyone stands in the chamber. In other words, if the Democrats move an amendment, everyone knows that they will support it. If you need to get up and mention people by name, you can do it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, funnily enough, there are vitally important issues, not just to the people in this chamber but to the people who are being affected, on which the two major parties vote together. Everybody in Australia is affected by telephony. I would like to put on the record that the so-called mickey mouse divisions in which just a few people&mdash;maybe just two&mdash;might vote in a certain way are often just as important because then the name of each person in this chamber, who is supposed to represent an electorate, not just a party, is put on the record in respect of where they stand on an important vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that you call them `mickey mouse' gives an indication of what you think people stand for.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This is another significant part of the debate. It is about the planning process and the very 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2135"> significant change to the immunities powers that the federal constitution gives the federal parliament on telecommunications. These powers have never been in doubt from Federation in 1901. The constitution makes the simple provision that the federal parliament shall have powers for post and telegraph. Whenever this has been challenged, the High Court has upheld that `telegraph' means all of the ranges of telephony and electronic transmission that have developed in our modern society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1991, when we introduced competition to Telstra and allowed two other carriers to come into the market, the government and the parliament voted that the immunities Telstra had in terms of the installation of infrastructure would be available to the new carriers. We have heard endless debate already about how that was used by and is being used by, in particular, Optus to string up overhead cable in the last two to three years. I am on the record in the Telstra inquiry last year as saying that in 1990, 1991 and 1992 nobody, even those who have now become Optus, ever suggested that there would be overhead cable hung around two million homes as has been done over the last year and is being done at this very moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra complained that they would have to provide the interconnect for the second and third carrier and provide the infrastructure; therefore the main argument at the time was over the interconnect fee. Nevertheless, that was the law. I suspect the parliament and the government of the day may well have taken a very different view about the regulations and operation of those immunities in the legislation of 1991-92 if we had been given any indication that the cables that are being rolled out around Australia now were going to be rolled out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The outrage in the community is overwhelming. I know of no other issue that has had 800 councils, through the Australian Local Government Association, across Australia carry a unanimous decision. They oppose the roll out the way it has been done. We have all been lobbied by councils at a local, state and national level that they want this changed. We have all seen reports of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> public meetings called by councils and local communities all around Australia when the cables have been rolled out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think all sides accept that it is now unsustainable for that pure immunity to continue in a deregulated market post 1 July this year. I think it would be impossible even if we still had the simple monopoly of Telstra being fully government owned. If it had wanted to do this I think there still would have been an objection and a change to the immunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has proposed a structure of immunities where&mdash;we may disagree with this when the transitional period cuts off; that is a debate for later this morning&mdash;after 1 July, and we agree with this, no new cable can go up without the approval of the local council or the local community. I think that position has been accepted everywhere, and so it should be. In the future the community wants a say on any major infrastructure and that is not just in terms of overhead cables but the other issue that is quite strong in the community&mdash;that is, the placing of mobile telephone towers. I think some 800 have been constructed. With GSM coming and more competition you may even get a doubling of that number. We may see an increase of another 200 or 300 towers, but we hope co&hyphen;location can stop that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think the carriers, whether Telstra, Optus or Vodafone, have covered themselves with glory in the way they have dealt with the community in handling the siting of towers. There has certainly been consultation, but, in the end, they have basically said, `Bad luck, you are getting the tower. We are going ahead with it. We are using the immunity.' This has to be changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The structure outlined in my amendments is different from the government's structure in one major respect, and this is the issue that the Senate should vote on. The minister has outlined the areas that are not low impact facilities and I have outlined the areas that I say are not low impact facilities in terms of towers and cables. The opposition wants a simple national system of appeal. First of all, the councils have the right for the first time to appeal and to say no. My model is that if there is a dispute where the council and the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2136"> carrier cannot agree on the infrastructure&mdash;but I presume that, if the council says no, overwhelmingly it will be the carrier&mdash;they can go to the ACA, the body established by this legislation and the federal parliament, and appeal and give the reasons for their appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The panel of the ACA would weigh up those issues. In debate on another occasion the minister suggested that the panel will be representative of a broad range of interests&mdash;not just telecommunications engineers but designers, architects, town planners, community representatives as well as technical engineers. It will be a broad based panel. In my amendment we make it clear that there needs to be a balance between the national interest of a national telecommunications system and the local environmental needs and local issues that are of concern to local people. The ACA would have to balance the two up. It is not a zero sum game where they say no and always give it to the carriers or always give it to the local community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We as a federal parliament, responsible for a national telecommunications system, have to be able to say that there are national interests that, from time to time, may override the strong objections of a local community. They will always create some heat in the local community, but when you have the demands that we have for mobile telephones we require more towers to be built and there will be objections to those. I think the appeal process means that over a period of time we can establish a process where we get the national and local balance basically right. This is a simple process which I have put forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would go straight from the local area if there is a dispute to the ACA. I think the government's proposal has a major deficiency. It allows the state governments to establish a planning process in between local consideration and the ACA appeal. In the end, in most cases you can still appeal to the ACA under the government's model after you have exhausted all the state appeal provisions. In my view, that is unnecessarily time consuming but above all expensive. The lawyers will be expensive and the costs will be borne by the carriers, but councils will also have to pay. I think we have to bear in mind that, by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and large, if you are a carrier like Telstra with $15 billion worth of turnover you actually have a very deep pocket for legal expenses compared with an average council in Australia where any cost running into tens of thousands of dollars has an impact on their annual budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that the ALGA have indicated that they want to cooperate with the model. They have indicated to me privately that they support the simplicity of the model I have put forward: they understand the simplicity of reduced cost and they know what they are dealing with. But, above all else, they have said they do not trust state governments to intervene between them and the federal ACA. I have to say I have some sympathy for their view about a state government being able to intervene and direct them&mdash;as state governments have constitutional power to do&mdash;not to be involved in appeals. They can change what local governments can do because they have the constitutional power. The only way you protect local governments from being overridden in this area by state governments is to have the model I have proposed here in amendments 1 to 15, 17 and 20.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under my model you will end up with one planning process and one code. One national set of guidelines could be informally developed by the ACA, in conjunction with local government, and made available to all 800 councils across Australia to give them guidelines on the sorts of issues they must look at when they are considering an application from a carrier about the siting of an infrastructure. What the minister is proposing is that we end up with eight forms of codes or plans for the six states and two territories. I have no doubt that we will end up with eight different planning arrangements&mdash;and that would be costly. In the 21st century it will be a version of what we did in the 19th century, when we ended up with different railway gauges, which has proved so costly to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing that concerns me is that, so far, there has been very little indication that state governments are even accepting that responsibility. I am indebted to the minister for writing to me on 14 March in response to a question I raised through the Senate inquiry 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2137"> on telecommunications. I asked what progress had been made with state governments in developing their planning arrangements. The minister outlined&mdash;and I would like to table this later, if there is no objection, because it is useful information&mdash;the phases in which the federal government is dealing with state governments over the planning arrangements. Phase one, in January and February, deals with information. Phase two, February and March, involves detailed issues identification. Phase three, to be completed by the end of March, involves preliminary decision making and the decision making framework. In relation to phase four&mdash;implementation&mdash;the minister's letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not possible at this stage to say what regimes the States and Territories will implement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At this stage, with only three and a bit months to go until 1 July, they cannot say what the regimes will be. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, after the March roundtable there will be three months to implement legislation and/or any uniform procedures.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Can anyone imagine that state governments are going to suddenly introduce&mdash;when most of them might even be sitting in that period&mdash;legislation and/or a uniform process? It then says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim will be to have arrangements in place by 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department understands that State and Territory Governments are examining their legislation to determine what changes are necessary . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That means, to me, that there is no way we are going to have eight states and territories with planning arrangements in place. There will be a void and, because of that void, who knows what will happen. But there would be no void under my model. It would be able to be done in a clear and transparent way. If the ACA, or now Austel, and DOCA cannot prepare the code and the guidelines in the three months between now and then, I will be very surprised. And if they cannot do it, there is no way the state and territory governments can.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Access powers. State and Territory governments will need to decide whether to confer carriers with</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen; access to land</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen; the ability to attach facilities to land</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen; the ability to do things on land.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is really conferring major powers back to the states. I hope we do not end up with a fight about what their power is and what the federal power is. According to attachment A, the other issues to be considered include immunities. I think immunities should only be dealt with by this parliament and that in no way should an opportunity be given to states. With regard to the issue of `Uniformity within the State and between States', again, this is a wish list. This is a hope that we can get uniformity, but there is no guarantee. It then says that there will be a role for local government and, finally, there is information on the treatment of public utilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate that the minister provided this information to me in good faith as a result of my query at the meeting of the Senate committee. But what it portrays is that there is going to be a planning void from 1 July. The only way out of that, as far as the opposition is concerned, is to adopt my amendments which would give councils, for the first time, the right to appeal. It would be a simple, transparent system of appeal that would be efficient and done quickly, and the decision would then be final. The other system is going to drag it on and we do not know what position state and territory governments will take. This is a major issue in the legislation. It is significant that, if the government's position is carried, for the first time we will devolve down to states major powers on telecommunications that we have had for 90&hyphen;odd years. These guarantee a national telecommunications system and we should continue to maintain that view.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Briefly, I think that what Senator Schacht has just outlined is one of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2138"> best arguments I have heard for why we eventually have to have changes to the constitution which give local governments some entity and some role within the law&hyphen;making process in Australia, because, in fact, they do represent all people in Australia. I am not sure if there are people in Australia who are not covered by a local government of some sort. State, local and regional governments frequently make the changes that are the closest to the people on a daily basis that affect their environment, their planning codes and the way they live.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that in the words `there will be a role for local government', the role is by grace and favour of the Commonwealth government and the state governments. It is one of the best possible arguments for why eventually we have to have some sort of constitutional change which allows local government to have an entity and to be able to represent their constituencies. They are not representing a minority; they are actually representing in each of their areas the views of Australians. They are closer to what is happening in each of those areas, urban and rural, than many people in this chamber can be because of their closeness to their constituencies. In support of the opposition's amendments, we do have to see that part of this problem has been created by the lack of constitutional entity of local and regional governments in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats would prefer to implement the national approval system, which was proposed by the Australian Local Government Association. When that was brought forward at the inquiry, it was clear that they were making a very substantial commitment to pull together every council in this country and to sign off on such an agreement. Our next set of amendments would seek to implement such a model, but I recognise that there is not support for that model.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, in its majority report to the telecommunications bills inquiry, said it would not support that model in its current form because it was not thoroughly and fully developed. Even so, we thought it was a far more attractive regime than that proposed by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the government. As such, we recommended that the government explore how to improve the proposal and how to make the amendments, but the government just dismissed it altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP has, on its part, sought to develop its own solution, which seems to us to have some merit. In the event that we are not going to get the required support for the ALGA proposal, we will support this one by the opposition, provided that we are convinced that it offers residents greater protection than the model proposed by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the concerns we have is how the proposed code of practice is to be developed. Clearly, there will be a lot of debate over the substance of this code. One thing we would like to see guaranteed in legislation is scope for public comment and input into the development of the code of practice. I note that the Democrat amendments Nos 67 and 68, further down the running sheet, impose legislative requirements for public input and consultation in the development of that code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this code of practice has a different purpose from the coalition's and the ALP's schemes, the principle of guaranteeing public input is just the same. I am not sure whether our amendments will still fit and apply without conflict with the ALP proposals here, but we would like to see some sort of guarantee of public input. So we will support the ALP proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to ask the opposition if they would be prepared to look at a couple of changes to that. We have three in mind. The first one is amendment 13, which spells out the items&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. It spells out the items which the ACA must have regard to in formulating the code of practice, which the opposition's proposal is dependent on. Would the opposition be prepared to add to amendment 13, on page 3, a new subclause (d)(v) to clause 3G with wording along the lines of: `an area that is listed on a regional or local heritage conservation list'? The reason for our suggesting this is that a number of councils have sites which are on their local heritage list. Many councils in Australia are required 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2139"> by state law to have local heritage lists and items on these lists would not be covered by the national or state lists, yet they are still of very significant heritage value.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add a few comments to this issue with respect to the administrative burden that the government's proposals are going to impinge upon medium sized and very large business enterprises. With irony, I note that a lot of the rhetoric we have heard from this government in general comment is about minimising imposition of regulation upon businesses. Yet, in this instance, we have a blatant example of the imposition of a very comprehensive and, in my view, unnecessary layer of regulation application that does not go to the merits of the issues being considered but just acquiesces to the particular interest groups&mdash;in this case, the state governments&mdash;rather than achieving any particular positive outcome for either the community or the carriers that are obliged to abide by these regulations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's model, as outlined by Chris Schacht, has inherent and necessary flexibility relating specifically to the needs of the local community through the local government. By having the review process going straight to the federal body, you have a mechanism to ensure national uniformity with the application of these regulations in a dispute. To add another layer is unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this issue is addressed in the context of the safety issues being raised about the facilities that come under this regulation, there is a very specific agenda&mdash;and has been for a number of years&mdash;to create national uniformity with respect to those regulations. A move now back to the states defies this trend in both Australian law and occupational health and safety regulations as much as it defies the government's own rhetoric with respect to removing unnecessary layers of red tape for business.</PARA>

But, on the other side of the street, if they have to go underground, they estimate it would cost them in the order of $230 million. Therefore, they would wait to connect people on the other side of the street until they had a sufficient number to warrant going underground. Effectively that would be discrimination against people on the wrong side of the street.

<PARA STYLE="Para">The intent of my amendment is that an overhead line cannot be declared a low impact facility. Proposed subclause (4A) states that `a designated overhead line must not be specified in an instrument under subclause (3)'. Proposed subclause (4B) states that `a telecommunications transmission tower, as defined by clause by 28 of schedule 1, must not be specified in an instrument under subclause (3)'. What this is clearly doing is making sure that overhead cables, which we have already debated, cannot be declared a low impact facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has made it clear that once we get through the transition period low cables can be appealed by local government&mdash;they cannot go up without approval of local government. The present review undertaken by Austel, now ACA, is looking at whether telecommunications towers could be considered a low impact facility and, therefore, have the immunity of the federal legislation and be outside planning appeal provisions, which the minister has already put in place, meaning there will be no appeal provisions. If it is considered a low impact facility, you cannot appeal against it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in opposition believe that a telecommunications tower by itself is a major facility and should now be declared by the parliament to be a non-low impact facility and be able to be appealed against and be involved in the planning process that this legislation puts in place. This would mean that if carriers and councils do not get agreement over the siting and construction of a tower in the local area under the minister's amendment, which has now been carried, they can then appeal through various designated state planning 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2150"> tribunals and processes or, ultimately, take it to the ACA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the issue of the towers is such in the community that the government and this parliament should not take the risk of having Austel declare them a low impact facility. If that happens, there will be outrage in the community, not just from councils but also from the general community who are concerned about the issue of visual pollution, the visual environment, and the geographic and natural environment in respect of where towers are placed as well as the ongoing discussion and debate, which is not conclusive by any means, about the health risks, if any, from electromagnetic radiation from these mobile telephone towers and other microwave towers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it would be very wrong of this parliament to allow that decision to be made by Austel/ACA. We should declare it right now. This is an appealable planning process where communities have the right to say no and if they disagree with a carrier and the carrier wants to take it to the ACA or through the appeal provision so be it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to indicate that government amendment No. 222, which the minister has circulated, goes three&hyphen;quarters of the way to agreeing with the opposition's amendment about towers now being declared non&hyphen;low impact facilities. The minister's amendment which has now been circulated is different from the one in the major set of government amendments. The time down the bottom is 4.50 p.m. on 20 March. It states:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the height of the extension does not exceed 5 metres; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) there have been no previous extensions to the tower.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For this purpose, the extension of the tower is to be considered by the review of whether it is a low impact facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition does not accept that. We welcome the fact that the government has reached 85 per cent agreement on towers generally being outside the review of Austel and being non&hyphen;low impact but we believe adding another five metres&mdash;or for those of us who grew up with another system of measurement about 15 feet&mdash;on top would be seen in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a lot of local communities as a major change not a low impact change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know one reason the minister will give for this being done is that it will encourage co&hyphen;location on an existing tower. We had the evidence before of some 700 or 800 towers that are up around Australia. Telstra has only agreed to co-locate eight so far.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="ALSTON" NAMEID="LD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator Alston</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think they said seven.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is either seven or eight. The days wear on with this debate. Clearly, the demonstrable issue should be that, by and large, if they can co-locate on the same tower&mdash;and when they take the analog transmitters off a number of these towers the GSM will go on; that is fine because the tower will stay the same&mdash;they should. I think a lot of people will argue that if you are going to increase the height of the tower by five metres or increase the transmission power because further carriers are using it, they will want to have a say about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also point out that under the planning provisions if a carrier said, `The council will not add 15 feet on the top. Therefore we are going to have to build a new tower somewhere in the same suburb to make sure we meet the demands of the subscribers who want mobile services,' I think the ACA would have to say, `We think, on balance, that it is better to have one tower that is an extra 15 feet higher than two separate towers.' That is a matter of judgment in the appeal process or in the planning arrangement at the state level or in particular for the ACA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is going to be an appealable process even with the extra 15 feet. I think if you just say that this is a low impact facility and the 15 feet or five metres can be added without an appeal provision is asking for a considerable amount of community disquiet and agitation. I acknowledge that the government has come a long way to meet the opposition's view. We are now arguing about the 15 feet or five metres, but I still believe that should be excluded from being a low impact facility.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition's amendment is almost identical to the Democrats' amendment No. 62 but there are a couple of differences. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2151"> Firstly, it ensures that a designated overhead line will not be included in the definition of low impact facility. This is something that the Democrats amendment does not do. We did not draft this into our amendment because frankly we did not think the government was capable of issuing a definition of low impact which included designated overhead lines. We think our confidence in this is borne out by the fact that government amendment No. 222 guarantees that designated overhead lines will not form part of the definition. If that was not the government's intention presumably they would not have ruled it out. Nonetheless, I think that is a worthwhile point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the ALP amendment rules out all towers from the definition of low impact as does our amendment. Clearly, this is much stronger than what the government is proposing. It is only prepared to rule out towers when they are up to five metres tall and attached to buildings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendment differs from the opposition's because it rules telecommunications transmission devices out altogether. I do not know that that is the appropriate phrase to use, but our intention is that antennas are also ruled out of the definition of low impact. The reason for that is that the visual aspect of towers is one point but the transmitters are the problem in terms of health and safety. We do not think you can just separate them and say, `Antennas are okay but towers are not.' They are part of the same item. I note in the government's most recently circulated amendment that it is made clear. The amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To avoid doubt, a reference in this clause to a <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">tower</EMPHASIS>  does not include reference to an antenna.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In this clause:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">tower</EMPHASIS>  means a tower, pole or mast.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Our concern is that low impact should not just be low visual impact. Low impact should also relate to health and safety, and I am sure we could have a three&hyphen;day debate on health and safety, which I do not propose to go into here. That is the reason for our amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is not a debate about whether or not you 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should allow facilities with an additional five metres attached to a tower or on the side of a building to be permitted. This is simply an argument about whether or not you ought to allow a public inquiry process conducted by Austel to make a recommendation to the minister for the minister to make a regulation as to what is a low impact facility, and, of course, that is a disallowable instrument. That is the path down which we would suggest the parliament goes. The alternative approach that Senator Allison would take is to rule all these things out absolutely&mdash;in other words, pre&hyphen;empt the Austel inquiry. On my advice, if you were to rule out everything, as Senator Allison would want to do, then Telstra would not even be able to have hand mounted mobile phones in their vehicles, let alone people being allowed to have antennas on the side of their houses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, there would be no low impact facilities. That is really what she is trying to achieve. That is quite contrary to the approach that we have taken. All that we are suggesting is that there should be a public inquiry to determine what should be a low impact facility, and you should rule out, now, towers above five metres. It is quite clear that those will not be low impact facilities. But what we say is that it should be left to Austel to have a public inquiry to provide advice to the government as to whether an additional five metres does constitute a low impact facility, whether co-location constitutes low impact facility and whether antennas on the sides of buildings constitute low impact facilities. You will get a chance to disallow that anyway in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a process that you can go through, which I would have thought is very democratic. What you are wanting to do is close off all that and say that none of these things should be regarded as low impact.

We are talking here about exempting certain installations from planning processes post, I think in this case, December this year. So it is reasonable for us to be concerned about what is to be designated low impact, because low impact means exemption from this.

But you have already pre&hyphen;empted that. You have said, `No, these all have to go there.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suggest to you, Minister, that you have decided. You are the one who has written this legislation. If you have had consultation with Austel, that is fair and reasonable. I would suggest to you that not a lot of work has been done by Austel or by the government to find out whether people are happy with a tower being extended by five metres. Five metres is a very large amount to be extending a tower. There would be, I would think, quite serious aesthetic concerns about that in some areas.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought you were suggesting that this was simply an arbitrary figure we plucked out of the air and were asking why we chose five metres. I am explaining to you the reason: it enables a second carrier to co-locate on a tower, which I would have thought you would be supportive of. In most instances, everyone has been trying to encourage co-location. You cannot co-locate unless you add to an existing tower to the tune of about five metres. So you cannot have it both ways. You cannot say, `We want co-location on the one hand, but we won't allow you to add to it on the other.' Five metres is a sufficient margin to enable that co-location to occur.</PARA></TALK.START>

We are simply saying it ought to be left to Austel to conduct a public inquiry, to make the judgment and to make a recommendation to the minister which results in a disallowable instrument.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment would not permit mobile phone towers to be constructed within 300 metres of schools, child-care centres, kindergartens or hospitals. This is a measure of prudent avoidance. I do not propose to speak at length on this matter. It is an amendment which we put forward in the last telecommunications debate. It is one we will continue to put up because we feel very strongly that it is important that children in particular are protected from the health effects that research is showing are more and more likely to be of concern.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Allison is correct in that this was discussed in the Telstra privatisation debate last year. We supported an amendment then for, I think, 250 metres. Even Senator Harradine showed some interest in a figure like that. Since then, I have indicated that the opposition will not support this amendment at this time for two reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, even with the government's amendment, you cannot construct a new tower without the local community having an appeal process. If they disagree with the siting of the tower close to a school or anywhere else, they can now appeal through the provisions that we have just carried today, even though they were not as perfect as I would like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time, a council can say no to the construction of such a tower. The carrier, if it cannot reach that agreement, can then appeal through the state planning processes and, ultimately, to the ACA. There is a quantum difference between what we were faced with in the Telstra dissolution bill and what we have now&mdash;that is, there is now an appeal process for local communities and that is an immeasurable improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the minister has indicated that there is a major review. I think the amendment is still to come on some of the health and safety aspects of the electromagnetic radiation. I saw that amendment privately this morning. It was  something I raised earlier in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the debate. I think that the research program also ameliorates that, compared with what we were faced with last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Finally, I have to say that until that research program is completed, it would be a bit odd to say outright, `No more towers anywhere within the 300 metres limit.' I noticed the other day on Flemington Road that there is a mobile tower facility on the top of the children's hospital. I am not sure what they got out of having it there, whether it was a bagful of money or whatever.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might have been nothing. But they are around and I think that this program and the amendment yet to come are a reasonable approach to take. I also want to say that no new tower&mdash;a full tower&mdash;can be built now under the government's own amendment, unless it gets approval of the local community, and if they disagree there will be an appeal process. It is a reasonable position until we get the report of this $4 million research program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just for the record, I believe the case is still open. From the evidence that I have seen, whilst the safe levels of electromagnetic radiation are still in dispute and there may be some risk, I note that Australians seem to want mobile phones in ever increasing numbers. There has to be a balance. Consumers want mobile phones running into millions, which means there will have be towers somewhere. The community is going to have to decide on the balance between the risk, if there is a risk, and the convenience of mobile phones. There is no black or white outcome on this. It is a matter of balancing the risk with the convenience. Where we are at the moment is probably reasonable.</PARA></SPEECH>

We are dealing with the littlies against the biggies&mdash;against the corporate weight. If there is no cost involved, perhaps the minister might tell us. But what are the likely costs involved in an appeal process if a carrier wishes to site a tower near a school and wishes to challenge the community's appeal?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a couple of points. The transitional period, about which we will be required to vote, means that towers will continue to be erected until December this year. So I would imagine that most of those not erected yet will be erected by then, which is why we need to take this action now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Schacht says he is happy to go along with the idea that it is unclear what the health risks associated with electromagnetic radiation are and to proceed apace without that knowledge. He refers to the 4&half;&hyphen;year period over which our research funding will stretch and says that at its end we should review the situation. We might not know in 4&half; years. There is nothing magic about $4&half; million being spent on research and public information and so on. Who knows if we will know conclusively in 10 years time? If you look at the tobacco industry, it has taken much longer than that. At the end of this $4&half; million we will not conclusively know one way or the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we do know is that there is an increasing body of evidence which suggests that human cells are affected by electromagnetic radiation. We know that there are changes to cell structures. We know that electromagnetic radiation can cause breaks in DNA structure, but there will be hundreds or thousands of research projects under way right around the world. They will discover changes to human biology but they will not necessarily prove 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the case one way or the other. It is not a black and white situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats think it is very important that we identify those people who are most likely to be vulnerable to these health effects and that we try to do something about it now and not leave it for another four years when, certainly, all of the mobile phone towers that are needed will have been erected and antennae will be everywhere. I think it is not good enough to use the excuse that we are doing something; that we have thrown a bucket of money at a bit of research yet to be defined and that is all we need to bother about; that we can satisfy all those who are worried by simply saying, `Until there is proof we do not feel obliged to take any action.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This would, I suggest, hardly cause any inconvenience even to the telecommunications industry. It is simply asking them to organise their network of towers so that they are not erected close to these facilities. We know that schools, child&hyphen;care centres and kindergartens are where young people are on a regular basis&mdash;often a daily basis&mdash;and that they will have chronic exposure to electromagnetic radiation. We also know that the research is showing that low levels of radiation&mdash;that is, not the thermal effects but low levels; Senator Schacht might learn something if he listens&mdash;in fact, may be just as deleterious as the thermal effects of radiation. That is where we are unclear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Austel and the industry itself are arguing that we are well within standards; that if you take measures around mobile phone towers, particularly directly under them, you will not find exposures which exceed the current standards. We all know that the industry, in effect, sets those standards and that they are not based on the research work that has been done on low levels of electromagnetic radiation. So we make no apologies for the fact that there is no specific research which says that what we are suggesting is justified. However, we think it is prudent, it is wise, it is sensible, and not too onerous on telecommunications companies, to have them think about this and to not site these towers in close proximity to those centres.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not think you can give any sensible indication of legal costs. I can tell you from my own not inconsiderable experience that legal costs can blow out quite unpredictably, depending upon the complexity of the issue and the extent to which the parties decide to call expert evidence. What might seem a simple point can suddenly become a matter of very substantial legal argument and you end up canvassing not just the facts but the law.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just say a few very quick words. For the interest of senators, particularly those at the far end of the chamber, we have at random selected two pages of the street directories in suburban Melbourne and Sydney to give an indication of what this would mean in terms of the areas left in those parts. You will see that in Sydney the great bulk of that part of Dulwich Hill, Earlwood, Canterbury and Summer Hill would simply not be able to sustain any mobile phones.

The problem with reliance on the code of practice is that we still do not know what it will contain. Moreover, there are no requirements in the proposed legislation for public consultation or an inquiry in developing this code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While Austel are currently undertaking an inquiry, there is no requirement that findings will be adhered to, nor is there any requirement for future inquiries. This is a notable omission given that, under subsection 117(5) of the current act, the minister must, before determining a telecommunications national code, publish a draft of the code and invite the public to comment on that draft. The minister must then cause a public inquiry to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2163"> be held for purposes of receiving and considering submissions about the draft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the view of the Democrats that if such a code is to be determined, a fully open public inquiry is required. Such a requirement would ensure that the community is provided with sufficient time for making its submission, and it would also require that the report stemming from the inquiry be made public. These amendments ensure that this is required by legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government accepts Democrat amendment 67, but we oppose 68 because it raises a number of practical difficulties. We have proposed amendment No. 23, which we will come to when debating the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996, that will require us to have a code in place by 1 July.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we adopt amendment 68, that 1 July deadline would become near impossible. Austel is not due to report on its existing public inquiry into the code until 30 April. The code then needs to be drafted and then the Democrats' amendment would require at least 30 days of public comment, followed by 15 days for tabling of a report. So, on that basis, it would be almost impossible to achieve the 1 July deadline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment would also make amending the code in future very difficult. The Acts Interpretation Act requires the amendment to an existing instrument to follow the same procedures as required for the making of the original instrument.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On this issue of discrimination, the Democrats have indicated that they will move their own amendment&mdash;which I think is 91&mdash;to oppose clause 42 and take it right out. That means that the existing position, which local governments claim applies, is that state governments have carried planning laws which allow councils to apply their own 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2167"> levies&mdash;and in New South Wales and South Australia councils are certainly looking at doing that&mdash;and the opposition has given very serious consideration to this. We have considered whether we should support the Democrat position of taking section 42 out, which would allow the discrimination to stand in at least two states. Of course, it might not stand very long. State governments might use their constitutional power in those two states&mdash;I suspect there is a fair chance that would happen&mdash;once councils started putting levies on and raising money which might not necessarily be spent for the purpose of undergrounding as I believe it should be. Any levy should only be spent for that purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Levies might be spent to build a new town hall or other council facilities, much of them socially very useful and which, in themselves, could not be disputed. But then, in effect, that would be a general tax on telecommunications for a non&hyphen;telecommunications purpose. From the opposition's viewpoint, those are issues that ought to be dealt with when you look at general revenue and tax raising measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The philosophical position is that, once you start allowing a tax to be put on a particular infrastructure, whether state or federal, by local government to do something else, you are rapidly going to move towards a less equitable position in the community about tax arrangements that are <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> fair to all. We have enough problem in this country with the difference between federal and state taxation and the levels of taxation between states and within states accordingly. Every time that happens, some inequities occur in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly can understand the angst of all councils, particularly those in Sydney and Adelaide, with the cable being rolled out, and the arrogant way in which they have been treated in this process and their views have been dismissed. People say, `It's a fair cop; if they can put a levy on it they should do it.' My own view and the opposition's view about this, which our caucus has had a considerable discussion about, is that we believe, in the end, if there is going to be a levy, it ought to be a national levy equitably applied to carriers and not cross subsidised. It ought 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to be applied for the one purpose of going underground over a reasonable time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three days ago in this debate the government took on board some amendments that I proposed on behalf of the opposition. We are still to conclude negotiations to come back later in this committee stage to the suggestion of my amendments being incorporated in the terms of reference for the panel the minister is establishing to report by July next year to himself and to parliament on a program of undergrounding the full cost benefit, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that is the better way to go. As a result, I will not support Democrat amendment No. 91 to delete clause 42. I do accept the minister's very legalistic&mdash;and I can understand why&mdash;further amendment to his amendment No. 245. As I understand it, it makes very clear the position of the overriding power of the minister, the government and this parliament on immunities on a delegation. This allows delegation to the state, but if at any stage we want to take it back or change it, we can do so by various instruments tabled in this parliament or by administrative discretion. I believe that is the correct way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to say to the minister that unless the government, when it gets this report, shows very serious concern about and a commitment to getting rid of overhead cables, you are just going to be on the rack for as long as you are in government, and any future government will be on the rack in one form or another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Though people, including the minister, say that some areas are now getting used to the cable being around, I am not sure that is totally correct. If you can work out a way in which, over a reasonable period, we can improve the urban landscape and streetscapes of Australia by getting rid of overhead cables, most people will give us all a pat on the back, quite rightly. The mood in the community for environmental reasons, et cetera, has moved quite considerably on these sorts of issues, certainly since Optus chose to make it a major issue by rolling out their cable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the ALGA will be disappointed in the opposition's support of the government on this. But I want to state that I believe the longer&hyphen;term interest is better achieved by a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2168"> general levy being developed at a national level through the processes within this bill and within our structure on managing telecommunications, rather than allowing two states, at the moment, to have a loophole for local government to do it&mdash;although I suspect a state government very rapidly would take that over. As Paul Keating once said, never stand between a premier and a bagful of money. If a premier can see a bagful of money by putting his own levy on telecommunications, and we have left a void, they will step in and grab it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons, I believe we should keep the national perspective about this. Although councils in New South Wales and my own state will be disappointed in the opposition's view on this, I think in the longer term we will have a better structure.</PARA></SPEECH>

The first amendment was to allow, under state planning arrangements, local governments and carriers, if they could reach an agreement on a levy to underground in a particular designated council area, to do so, so long as the levy was approved by the ACA. Therefore, such issues as cross subsidy could not be abused and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of that amendment was to put into the terms of reference the whole issue of the constitutionality of imposing a levy on overhead infrastructure, so that it could be done within the constitution.

<PARA STYLE="Para">The simple intent of my amendments is to make it clear that the cut&hyphen;off date for the roll&hyphen;out of cable around Australia is 1 July. The government's position is that there be three months extra allowed for so&hyphen;called completion of the already planned roll&hyphen;out on the network. I think there is also an indication that if legal actions may have delayed the carriers' plans et cetera they can have that added on as well. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Our position is very simple. Well over 12 months ago back in January 1996 the then minister made it pretty clear and again emphasised that the immunities would end on 1 July. We also announced, going right back to 1991&hyphen;92, that in the duopoly or triopoly model the immunities of the three carriers could only be guaranteed after 1 July. Before that, the parliament would review it&mdash;which we are doing now&mdash;and introduce legislation that may change the immunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was made very clear and explicit in policy statements by the former government. The roll&hyphen;out of the cable was always taken on by the carriers knowing that before 1 July the law could be changed and a different operation could be available post&hyphen;1 July this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the common expectation in the community and amongst councils and, up until a few months ago or some time last year, the common expectation of all the carriers. But the carriers&mdash;in particular Optus and to some extent Telstra&mdash;in their desperation to get the cables rolled out before any sort of exemption or local government appeal is allowed, have said that they now want another three months added on. Well, I think it is an absolutely outrageous ask&mdash;to extend it beyond 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Optus decided to roll this cable 3&half; years ago, I think it was, back in 1994&hyphen;95. They did so knowing 1 July was the deadline. Telstra 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2173"> in wanting to do roll&hyphen;out to match them also knew 1 July was the deadline. I think it is very cheeky indeed to say, `Well, we haven't quite finished the roll&hyphen;out. We've still got a plan on the table. We might have put a bit of extra wire up and we may have tabled a street map of Adelaide or Sydney to say we were going to do this in the same plan.' I just say, `Bad luck.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really think it is very unusual. In most other areas of legislation, when you give years notice that the immunity or the position under the law would change and there is no guarantee beyond that date, people have planned accordingly. These carriers are asking for an exemption that most other people, major organisations and community groups have never got. When a parliament gives a cut&hyphen;off date, you know that that is what it is going to be and you plan accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a very rich ask indeed to extend the roll&hyphen;out by three months, so that is why the opposition has moved its amendment, which is to make it clear that 1 July is the cut&hyphen;off point for the roll&hyphen;out and that that is the end of it. I hope that in this case we do get a majority in the Senate     to support that cut&hyphen;off date, because the carriers, up until last year, fully and absolutely understood that the deadline was 1 July of this year.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mean you have an extra three months; you have got to have commenced construction by 30 June and, in order to get to that point, you need to have made your planning applications, which means, for practical purposes, that unless those are in place by April&mdash;so, within the next six weeks&mdash;it will not happen anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the reality is, as you well know, that the carriers have each embarked on $3 billion to $4 billion roll&hyphen;outs.

And in these circumstances they are the minimum necessary to enable some continuity in building networks where traditionally there is a long lead time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You cannot just go back and say, `You should have started something some months earlier' when they have a staggered roll&hyphen;out where, as we know, they concentrated on Melbourne and Sydney first, then they went to Brisbane and then they moved to Adelaide. It is no use saying, `Well, with hindsight, you should have been rolling out everywhere at once so you got it all done at the same time.' The physical resources are not there to do that. If they are to embark on a sensible strategy to recoup their investment over a period of time, then they need to do it in such a way that there is a progressive roll&hyphen;out. And that is what has happened here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2174">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you know, we took the view&mdash;and I think a lot of people in Adelaide would take the view, as we now see from some of the agreements that are being reached&mdash;that they did want a progressive roll&hyphen;out; that they did not just want a sudden death cut&hyphen;off on 30 June. And we think it is a very important requirement to allow for transitional arrangements for the installation of those facilities, particularly where legal action has restrained the commencement or the completion of an activity in the event that the action proves ultimately unsuccessful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of the new national code further delayed the roll&hyphen;out. There is no doubt that the Dunford decision in New South Wales, which applied particularly to Optus, would again have set its planning processes back some months. They had to go back to the drawing board, basically. You cannot blithely say,`Oh, well, you should just speed up the process' or `You ought to press button A' or `Go a bit harder on the accelerator.' There is only so much capacity in the system; there are only so many firms involved in roll&hyphen;outs; there is only so much money available according to the loan facilities that you have in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be a very irresponsible position to adopt to simply say, `Don't care about the financial consequences; don't care about the people of Adelaide; don't care about anything other than the fact that we are going to knock you off on the dead of midnight on 30 June,' when the carriers would have had every legitimate expectation that things were going to change dramatically from 1 July 1997 but no knowledge and no reason to anticipate&mdash;unless you have been out telling them&mdash;that there would be no transitional arrangements. Why would they not have been entitled to assume that? That is always the case in large investment expenditure items, and it is no different in this situation.

I would have to say that your own government departments were partly responsible. Check back and see what your own finance department answered to some of my initial questions to them. The legitimate expectation that we were given, in concern about environmental issues, was this: the expectation is that from 1 July 1997 they will be subject to state and federal planning laws and normal procedures. So the expectation has been around for a long time; it is not a surprise; it is not the need for retrospectivity.

At the time we did not make those statements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could accept your amendment, but we will not. We believe the issue on cabling is unique and clear cut. We made previous statements and carriers made statements and accepted, back when they rolled it out, that 1 July was the deadline. I cannot remember similar debate at the time about the construction of mobile towers being rushed ahead to meet a 1 July deadline. That was a decision of the carriers. They used their existing immunity; there was not the same argument about towers. Some of that argument about towers has come in the meantime. I will give those towers that are under construction the benefit of the doubt because the argument was not the same.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the concern is not so much that it is retrospective but that the carriers would have had a legitimate expectation that there would be transitional provisions in place. As I have said, it is one thing to anticipate that from 1 July there will be very different rules in the game; it is another thing to say that, if you have not actually completed something by that date, it is a sudden-death cut-off. What the transitional provision allows is that, if you have obtained approval&mdash;that process normally takes a couple of months&mdash;and you have commenced construction, you have to complete it within the three-month period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Schacht's amendment would simply say that you do not have that luxury; you would have to complete it by 30 June. If you are halfway through, that is bad luck. That is a very tough position to adopt because there was never any suggestion that there would not be transitional arrangements. All that was understood was that there would be a different regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, the carriers are entitled to plan their roll-out accordingly. You cannot do everything at once. You have to do it on a phase basis. As we know, in order to accommodate Adelaide&mdash;which was one of the four capital cities targeted in the first instance&mdash;and complete that roll-out, it was made perfectly obvious that could not be done by 30 June. That was for a combination of reasons, but the national code certainly slowed matters down.</PARA>

The transitional provisions require that you have been through the planning process and commenced before 1 July. It is not a matter of just saying you have an extra three months.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that occurs is to enable them to complete a commitment that they embarked on several years ago&mdash;a multibillion dollar outlay, a roll&hyphen;out that has been progressive and that allows them to have a sensible phase down.

If they are extended, then perhaps that will add value.</PARA>

Therefore Optus, as a board member, with due diligence&mdash;unless they are complete idiots&mdash;would have said, `Let's check the legislative basis on which we are planning this $2 billion or $3 billion roll&hyphen;out.' If you mean to say they all sat there, as directors, and thought that this regime was not going to change beyond 1 July when there was an announce 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment that the immunities would be up for reconsideration some time before or after a major review, they should be taken out by their shareholders now and sued. It would be an absolute breach of due diligence for them not to have thought to go out and check the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The announcements made in 1994&hyphen;95, when they started the roll&hyphen;out, were quite clear and succinct. They had until 1 July to get the cable past 20 per cent of Australian homes, wherever they chose to roll it. They chose to do it city by city. They chose to put Adelaide last. They chose to leave Perth until sometime whenever, Hobart until whenever, and the rest of regional Australia maybe never. They made that decision knowing that, by 1 July, their aim was to get that cable past 20 per cent of Australian urban homes. They chose to leave Adelaide until last; we are not unused to that in Adelaide&mdash;being left until last or second last on most planning decisions by boards established in Sydney or Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of this transitional arrangement has only come about in the last 12 months. You would have to be blind not to expect that some objection would be made by councils and communities when, out of the blue, a new cable is hung down the streets of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane or that there might be a little bit of a reaction and agitation. But, to their astonishment, they got it wrong. Councils and communities looked at every opportunity for stopping it and at what the planning arrangements were. There were injunctions taken out, and they had to go back and do it again. That was their mistake&mdash;still within the 1 July deadline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During 1996, it was Optus which came forward and lobbied for a transitional arrangement. It was not proposed by the department or the minister; it was around the place that they were out lobbying for the transitional arrangements. They were saying to you, Minister, `There has been a bit of a delay. We have a bit of a problem. Adelaide is a bit of a mess because of all those Bolshevik councils down there,'&mdash;all Marxist led apparently, according to the definition you gave Senator Margetts&mdash;`are on the warpath. We may not be able to complete it now.' They have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2180"> banners all over Adelaide saying `No Overhead Cables for Adelaide' and `Don't Connect to Optus' et cetera. Those councils took that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the board of Optus did not realise, through all of this period, that there were going to be some delays and hiccups along the way, that is their problem. But they came to you to ask for the transitional arrangement to get an extension. In fact, they asked for six months; you cut them back to three, as I understand. If you could have given them nine months they would have accepted that. If you had given them absolute immunity forever they would have been very happy with that as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of transitional arrangements was not put on the table by the government and it certainly was not put on the table by the previous government. It came from the carriers to enable them to get themselves out of a hole of their own making. I find that extraordinary. I do not mind carriers saying that in reasonable areas but when it was consistently a matter of public debate and when they themselves said, during 1995 and 1996, `We have to complete the roll&hyphen;out by 1 July because that is the deadline,'&mdash;they said that during 1994&hyphen;95 and until 1996 when they started asking for a transitional arrangement&mdash;I find that duplicitous. All through those years, when this cable was being rolled out, the carriers themselves said that they knew the deadline was 1 July. We are doing nothing here. I think Senator Harradine made the point that we are not, with retrospective legislation, knocking them off. It is for the future; they have had fair warning&mdash;1 July is the date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have only been in the parliament nearly 10 years. I cannot recollect too many times where there has been fair warning given that legislation may be amended&mdash;and the rules are changed openly and transparently, and fair notice is given that they may be changed&mdash;that people have not said, `If parliament has changed it when they said they would look at it, that's a fair cop.' To say that these carriers are being unnecessarily and harshly treated is just not correct. Therefore, I really have to say, for the sake of the credibility of this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parliament and the legislation we introduced six years ago about the cut&hyphen;off date, and for the expectation of the overwhelming majority of Australians who have had the issue of cables in their suburbs and their streets, we have to stick to 1 July.

That is not an unreasonable requirement. Those who want to stop the cable rollout by hook or by crook have tried everything along the way. To say there should not be any transitional provisions is simply perfectly consistent with that approach, but it is not normal business practice. It is not what

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Talking of provocation, I was not going to speak again on this matter, but the minister pushes me to do so. It is pretty clear that he is talking about getting aerial cabling done for the rest, which includes most of Adelaide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to remind the minister about a couple of things he said in the not too distant past. One was in a private meeting with me late last year. During the meeting he indicated that there would be no new national code; there was not a reason to have one because, as we all understood it, as of 1 July, the new regime would be in place and that would be a guarantee of the end of immunities. His press release of 4 April 1996 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community concerns about the environmental impact of telecommunications facilities such as aerial cabling and mobile phone towers are being addressed by the Government as a matter of priority . . . The Government aims to have a new code in place from 1 July. . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have about eight pages of comments. They state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly the government will, after public inquiry, put in place from 1 July a new code . . . The new national code will operate in the period leading up to 1 July, when a regime based on state and territory laws also announced by the minister today would take over.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In none of these documents&mdash;and they all come straight from your office, Minister&mdash;is there any reference at all to a transitional period during which the completion of the cabling could be put in place. They all talk about 1 July as being the end of one regime and the beginning of another, at which time carriers need to go through normal council procedures. So there is absolutely no doubt that the community, the Senate, the rest of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2182"> parliament, the carriers and local government all understood that this was the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can only conclude by that that you do not have, as you said, the concerns of the community as a matter of priority. Senator Tierney has gone around saying that there is nothing much that this government can do about aerial cabling, that they are doing their best but what they have been left with from the previous government ties their hands. We see here a perfect opportunity for the government to do something about all these concerns that they seem so worried about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People like me, Senator Margetts and members of the opposition are seen to be stopping the roll&hyphen;out. What nonsense! All we are doing is saying that after 1 July the state and territory laws come into play and that this protective regime that we have had for carriers would cease on 1 July. We are not wanting to stop the cabling roll&hyphen;out; we are simply suggesting to you that it is time to get them underground. The industry understood that and so did everybody else.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I indicate that the 93.4 per cent figure and indeed the 96 per cent figures that we are now committed to refer to an ISDN comparable service being available within 90 days of request. The government has, as promised, reworked the amendments into a form so that these amendments all deal with making ISDN comparable digital data capability available and to cover four areas of legislation; namely, an objects condition, a licence condition, a monitoring and reporting requirement and a requirement to undertake a review with a view to making an appropriate ISDN comparable service part of the USO. The proposed object of the bill now is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to provide a framework under which a carriage service that provides digital data capability comparable to an ISDN channel is to become available to all people in Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> by 1 January 2000; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> by another date having regard to the findings of the review into the timing of the availability of that service;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This wording should address the concerns previously expressed about the day by which ISDN should be available. The licence requirements, the revised amendment 28, are essentially the same as the government's earlier amendment but important changes have been made to the target date by which Telstra is required to meet the 96 per cent availability target. It also requires the minister to ensure that Telstra's carrier licence is subject to one or more conditions directed towards achieving the result that Telstra is in a position to make available a carriage service that provides a digital data capability broadly 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> comparable to that provided by a data channel with a data transmission speed of 64 kilobits per second to at least 93.4 per cent of the Australian population by 1 July 1997 and at least 96 per cent of the Australian population by 31 December 1998. These targets refer to ISDN comparable services being available within 90 days of request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This brings the 96 per cent target forward by one year. A review will then be undertaken about the roll-out of ISDN services to the remaining four per cent of customers prior to 30 September 1998. That will consider the propriety of the 1 January 2000 target date and the best means of achieving it. The monitoring requirements closely reflect the wording of the proposed object provision. The ACA must monitor and report each financial year to the minister on progress made. The revised amendment 62 provides a firm statement on the government's commitment to dealing with the issue.</PARA></SPEECH>

It was probably the most mendacious reporting I have seen in the Australian press. It was the worst sort of beat&hyphen;up, calculated to promote further prejudice against Indonesia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The relationship between Australia and Indonesia is of very great importance to this country. We are neighbours geographically 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and nothing will ever change that. We want to live in peace and harmony with our neighbours in the region. No two countries anywhere in the world start with more differences between them than Australia and Indonesia. We have differences ethnically, culturally, in religion and in government. Indonesia is an emerging democracy; Australia is an old and stable democracy. Australia is a united country; Indonesia has several thousand different groups and has difficulties with regions like Aceh, Kalimantan, Irian Jaya and Timor. Despite this and although we have had a few acrimonious times over the years, the relationship has matured enormously since I was first in Indonesia in 1962.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indonesia itself has changed. Literacy levels have gone up dramatically and poverty levels have declined. Infrastructure and development of the nation has been at a great pace through the last decade or more. Importantly, there has been a very significant change in the field of human rights and Indonesia's respect for them. Australia does not encourage further Indonesian progress down this path and the advancement of human rights with articles like this one which  appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is particularly important through the next year or so, and in the run&hyphen;up to the Indonesian elections, that there is accurate and responsible reporting of Indonesian affairs, not the scurrilous type of article, incorrect in nearly every detail. Since it was so much at variance with my recollection of the facts, I have researched the article carefully, including speaking to the Australian ambassador at the time and to other sources. Let me deal now with the article.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The headline of the article is `The secret of an execution'. The secret referred to is the burial service of the five journalists. There never was any secret about that. In fact, 35 people&mdash;including representatives from the Australian, British and New Zealand embassies&mdash;attended the funeral service. Also, there were media present from the Australian Broadcasting Commission, Reuters and the Indonesian press. Then it says in the first sentence of the article:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2187">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the first picture of how five murdered Australian journalists were laid to rest, buried together in a shared pauper's grave.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The first picture claim is quite wrong and grossly inaccurate. The ABC actually televised the service in Jakarta in December 1975. It even re&hyphen;ran file tape of the event in its 7 p.m. television bulletin on 16 January this year. How could it have re&hyphen;run file tape if it had not been present?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pictures appeared in the Indonesian press. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> printed pictures of the grave on 21 and 22 October 1995 and again on 13 September 1996. Where it says `the five Australian journalists', the accurate point there is that there were five journalists employed by the Australia press. Only two of them were Australian, two of them were British and one was a New Zealander. They were not murdered; they were killed on the battlefield and that is an entirely different matter in different circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were not buried in a pauper's grave. The grave was bought and paid for by the Australian embassy in the Christian section of the Kebayoran cemetery in Jakarta and has been maintained at taxpayers' expense ever since. There are four very serious mistakes all in the first sentence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the assertion that `the families were not told of the funeral until afterwards' is false. The consent of the families to the proposed service was obtained in advance through the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs, the British Foreign Office and the New Zealand Department of External Affairs. Otherwise, the three embassies could not have taken part in the service. Mrs Shackleton admitted that she gave consent for the service in an interview on the ABC on 16 January.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The assertion that `yesterday Mr Woolcott', who was the ambassador, `spoke publicly for the first time about his role in the burial' is quite untrue. Apart from speaking publicly at the service himself, he has responded to numerous questions from journalists over the last 20 years. The statement that `successive Australian governments have refused to give details of the burial' is also false. I know of no detail or any instant where a government 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in Australia has tried to cover up the funeral service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the statement misquotes the Sherman report as finding that `they were probably killed by Indonesian soldiers'. It would not have been very difficult for the writer of this article to check the Sherman report and read it the way I did. He would have found out that what Mr Sherman said was that the journalists were probably killed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . by members of a mixed attacking force of Indonesian soldiers and anti&hyphen;Fretilin East Timorese . . . in the heat of battle while fighting was continuing to occur.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They were not murdered. So much for the accuracy of this article. Then in the editorial of the same paper we have a similar jingoistic approach to the subject. We have a repeat of the claim that they were murdered, which is a most inflammatory way of referring to their unfortunate death. The lack of scholarship in the editorial and the lack of respect for accuracy is exactly the same as in the lead story in the paper. Both of these reflect an appalling standard of journalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Articles like these only promote prejudice in the wider Australian community against Indonesia, an end result which is not constructive to either country. Finally, I note in the article that the source was `Melbourne based activist Jim Aubery'. He is one of the anti-Indonesian lobby in this country.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2187"><TITLE>Ethanol</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a serious issue today on behalf of the employees of the integrated starch and gluten plant which produces the environmentally friendly alternative fuel ethanol near Nowra in the electorate of Gilmore. These people have, for too long, had their pleas unanswered. I appeal to the government to alter what is clearly a flawed budget decision&mdash;one that highlights the government's disdain for the environment and their contempt for this symbolic group of workers in regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first budget of the Howard government a bounty given to producers of ethanol was savagely cut, even after the grandiose commitments given on the environment 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2188"> during the election campaign. What we see now is the typical response from the Howard government&mdash;a body blow to regional enterprise, an enterprise that is a credit to the south coast of New South Wales. The coming May budget must reverse this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was in the late 1980s, when the threat of the greenhouse effect gripped Australia&mdash;and, indeed, the entire world&mdash;that we were forced to look for alternative energy and fuel sources. The ever increasing size of the hole in the ozone layer, the alarming incidence of skin cancer and the threat of global warming all posed serious dangers to our planet. We had to try to stop the massive environmental damage we were inflicting on the earth. We had to start looking for alternative energy and fuel sources. We finally came to realise that the overuse of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, which are non-renewable resources, was causing great harm to the planet. The amount of carbon dioxide given off through the overuse of these energy sources was clearly one of the main contributors to this widespread environmental damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1990 I was chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, which examined ways to reduce the impact of the greenhouse effect. In the summary of our report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rescue the future</EMPHASIS>, tabled in February 1991, the committee recognised Australia's role in greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, regardless of the greenhouse effect, action had to be taken to increase energy use efficiency, as this would result in resource and cost savings to the benefit of everyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the longer term initiatives were to focus on alternative and renewable sources of energy which emit less greenhouse gases, particularly for transport. Road transport was responsible for almost one&hyphen;quarter of carbon dioxide emissions. Through using lower carbon fuels, the quality of the air we breath will be greatly improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Labor government had already made the decision to move towards the elimination of chlorofluorocarbons in a time scale ahead of the Montreal targets, we knew that we had to start looking towards alternative lower carbon fuels. One of these fuels was ethanol. The former Labor government 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> took up the challenge. By encouraging the industry to invest in new plants and equipment for production and new technologies for producing renewable fuel ethanol, we were able to make a positive step in encouraging industry and helping the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994 we implemented the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Bill. The purpose of the bill, as former minister David Beddall said, was to provide a strong incentive for the eventual development of a competitive, viable and ecologically sustainable ethanol transport fuel industry in Australia. Effectively we sought to encourage those companies already producing ethanol to increase the size of the market. It was further hoped that other producers would enter the market. Twenty&hyphen;five million dollars was to be invested by our government in the scheme. Industry received 18c per litre produced. By building sales of fuel ethanol and introducing it into industry and transport as a blended alternative fuel, airborne lead emissions and carbon dioxide emissions would be reduced, saving our natural environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Later, in 1993, the Manildra Group opened a $23 million ethanol plant in Nowra on the New South Wales coast. The time and money invested in the ethanol plant indicates a commitment to local industry and the environment. Producers such as the Manildra Group invested about $35 million in total, with the government investing $4 million out of the allocated $25 million bounty pool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the first budget of the Howard government undid all these measures. By severing the bounty for ethanol production, the strong incentive to keep on investing was taken away from the producers. Employees at the ethanol plant first contacted me in July last year to express their concerns at the slashing of the bounty. Even though strong representations were made to the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) on the bounty, the bounty was still lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we would like to believe the government's claims that it is still in support of the development of ethanol as an environmentally preferred alternative fuel, it is very hard to accept. While we would also like to believe that this government is committed to halting 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2189"> unemployment, we can clearly see that this is not the case. While the Australian environment will lose out over the cutting of the bounty, employees in the field, particularly employees in this regional area, will suffer also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last few weeks I have been in contact with the Manildra Group. They have gravely informed me that probably five or six people from the Nowra plant may lose their jobs. I am also led to believe that CSR, the other ethanol producer, has already been forced to cut people from its work force. Of course, the opportunity for job creation has also disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Manildra Group had managed to keep the ethanol production plant in Nowra operating at the same level as before. Yet had the bounty remained in place, 20 more people would now be employed. All contracts signed before the bounty cuts have not folded. However, they cannot keep going forever. Employees involved in all stages of production are waiting for changes to occur with great concern. Fifty people associated with building a new plant are waiting for work to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is up to the government to rectify its mistakes through the next round of budget deliberations. If they perpetuate this error, they will show their true colours. They will prove to us all what a phoney government they really are. They are phoney in their concern for the environment. They are phoney in their concern for small business. Further, they are false in their intentions towards the workers of the nation, particularly workers in regional areas. Mostly importantly, the contempt of the Howard government towards regional Australia and small business will be exposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appeal to the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) to make representations on this. They must take up the cudgels in the processes of this budget. If they fail to do that they will fail Australia and the environment and resources industries. I appeal to them to make this a major issue. Although it is a small industry it is symbolic of all those things I have said. The onus is now on the

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very appropriate, having heard that speech from Senator Childs, that I will speak about things green. Sunday, 23 March is the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the world's first Greens party. At an overflow meeting, a protest meeting against the imminent flooding of Lake Pedder, in the Hobart town hall on that date 25 years ago, a motion was put that a new political party should be established. On the floor of the Tasmanian House of Assembly there was total unanimity that the flooding of Lake Pedder should proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although there were growing public protests about the loss of one of the most gently beautiful places in the Tasmanian wilderness&mdash;and, indeed, on the face of the planet&mdash;the Labor and Liberal parties of the day were unanimous in turning their backs on that feeling. There was not one voice in the house of government in Tasmania to represent those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Out of that came a new political party. It was first mooted I understand by a couple of people talking with their feet on a rock in the central plateau of Tasmania. Amongst those who devised this idea was Dr Richard Jones, who became one of the early co&hyphen;leaders of the United Tasmania Group, which was the first Greens party, and who was president through the early and middle 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The party failed to win a seat in the Tasmanian House of Assembly in the election in May 1972 by a few hundred votes. It contested subsequent House of Assembly and Senate elections, and in my first effort with the United Tasmanian Group in 1975, standing as No. 2 on the Senate ticket, state wide I was able to pick up 112 votes. I subsequently stood in eight elections for the Greens Tasmania, losing four and winning four. It is a great pleasure for me to be representing them in the Senate today. The Tasmanian 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2190"> Greens group is a direct descendant of the United Tasmania Group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what a world of difference from 1972. In 1996, there are between 80 and 100 Greens parties around the world. The Greens hold the balance of power in the parliaments of Finland, Georgia and Italy. In recent years, the Greens have been elected as mayors in Rome, Dublin and at least four major cities in Brazil. In Rio de Janeiro the elected secretary to the department of environment is a Green and the department has a staff of 6,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some 14 Greens parties in Africa. Last year I had the terrific pleasure of meeting the new and vigorous Greens party of Taiwan whose first effort was to sail out into the impact zone where rocket tests were being tried out by the People's Republic of China at the time of the Taiwanese elections. It shows the grit and public response that the Greens can mount as against some of the older parties which are caught up in the business of talking rather than acting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia, the Greens now have a long record. We have the Australian Greens group, which works in close liaison with our friends the Greens (WA). Incidentally, the first parliamentarian to take the label of `Greens' in this nation was Jo Vallentine from Western Australia. She was a major figure in the Senate in her time. She put up with a lot as the first Greens parliamentarian in the national arena and took on the title of Green MP in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look at where the word came from. It was not just Kermit saying that it is not easy being green. Long before he made that epic statement&mdash;if I may be light about it&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some consideration needs to be given to the triteness of that statement not just Kermit's. Petra Kelly the feisty, intelligent, indefatigable German Green came to Australia in the mid&hyphen;1970s. She saw the green bans which the unions, not least Jack Mundy, were then imposing on untoward developments in Sydney at the behest of a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whole range of citizens who were being ignored by parliaments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thank glory that, because of their action in the mid-1970s, such places as the Rocks, one of the most attractive parts of Sydney, still exist. She took back with her to Germany this idea of Greens' bans, or the terminology. As best we can track it down, that is where the word `green' as applied to the emerging Greens in Europe came from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Petra Kelly had worked with the Democrats in the United States, she had worked on Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign and she had worked with the Social Democrats in Germany. She came to the conclusion that so many of the rest of us have come to: that is, the old parties simply do not have the ability to meet the needs of the latter part of the 20th century and the 21st century, which we are about to enter, neither the environmental crisis of this age nor the social crisis coming out of a globalising community, which has a politics of economic fundamentalism almost in every corner of the world, almost in every established, older political party no matter where you look. She, with others, was a driving force in the rise of the Greens in Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first Green MP was elected in Belgium in 1979. Consequently, Greens have been elected in almost every country in Europe. For example, in recent elections in Sweden, 17 Greens were returned to the parliament and more than 500 Greens were elected at the local government level. It is interesting that, in 1995, 16 Greens were elected at the local government level in New South Wales, and it gave us terrific pleasure in the run&hyphen;up to our anniversary just this last week to hear that Margaret Henry had been elected to the Deputy Lord Mayor's position in Newcastle&mdash;the first time we have had a Green elected to such a high post in local government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are Greens by name or by nature in local government throughout the states and territories of Australia. There are now 12 Greens in the parliaments, state and national, in Australia: the three Greens returned to the Western Australian upper house just before Christmas, the two Greens in the Legislative Assembly in the ACT, the one in the upper house in New South Wales, the two of us 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2191"> herein the Senate and the four Greens in the balance of power in Tasmania led by the most colourful, articulate and far-sighted leader in the Tasmanian parliament, Christine Milne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are looking forward to a great indoor pageant in Hobart on Sunday. We feel like letting our hair down. We do not stop enough to celebrate as there is so much on our plate, but we are really marking the evolution of a new global political force in politics in a world that greatly needs it. We are very 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2192"> happy about where we are at 25 years after those people in the Hobart Town Hall got together and said, `We need something brighter, something with more long-term vision, something more committed to future generations and something more committed to a working relationship again between we five billion people and this one fragile, beautiful little planet that gives us life in this spectacular universe.'</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="4.11 p.m." PAGE="2192"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 4.11 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT></CHAMBER.XSCRIPT></HANSARD>
