<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5258"> personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable `active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="WH4">Senator McGauran</NAME><FROM>(from 36 citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are still the only Australians, sent overseas on active service, whose service has not been recognised in three important areas:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. R.A.N. casualties are not yet included on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial alongside Army and R.A.A.F. casualties;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. R.A.N. service has not yet been recognised with the visible signs of service to Australia; the Returned from Active Service Badge and the Naval campaign medal; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. R.A.N. service is still not acknowledged as eligible service for the Australian Service Pension, while service by Commonwealth and allied veterans from 55 other countries is.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members of the Army and R.A.A.F. who served during the same period in Malaya had their service fully recognised 24 hours after arriving in Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1997 Budget the Government partly recognised that R.A.N. service was `operational' and accepted responsibility for disabilities resulting from that service. Those affected appreciate the belated, partical recognition. However, government departments are still resorting to old, and inventing new excuses, to deny the above 3 points.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request that the Senate acts to help remove the injustice of 40 years and fully recognise R.A.N. service by providing the same recognition and benefits for that service. The cost will be minuscule, being mainly a transfer of pensions from `age` as paid by the Department of Social Security, to `service' pensions, paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator Woodley</NAME><FROM>(from 32 citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats greatly regret the decision of the government not to accept the Senate's amendments to the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1996. We also regret the government's decision not to proceed with the People's Convention in December this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our parties remain committed to ensuring that all Australians are given an opportunity to have their say on whether Australia should become a Republic, with an Australian as our Head of State. Accordingly, we urge the government to join with us in adopting a constructive approach to the Republic debate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this end, we are jointly sponsoring this bill, announced yesterday by the Leader of the Australian Democrats and the Leader of the Opposition, in the Senate. The Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Kim Beazley MP, is introducing a similar bill into the House of Representatives today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the holding of a plebiscite, a national vote, on whether Australia should become a Republic. The plebiscite will be conducted in accordance with the usual forms and precedents as provided in the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. This includes provision for a compulsory attendance ballot as has been the case at every significant national vote since 1924.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill would allow the plebiscite to be held at any time between now and the next Federal election. This will provide the Parliament with the maximum flexibility to determine the appropriate timetable for the plebiscite. It would allow the election to be held in conjunction with the next federal election, if that was considered desirable for cost saving reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The form of the question to be put at the plebiscite would be determined by a Joint Parliamentary Committee. We believe that the committee should consist of 6 members of the government, 4 from the Opposition, 1 from the Australian Democrats and 1 chosen from amongst the other minor parties and independents represented in the parliament. However, we are, of course, open to discussion on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Parliamentary Committee will be required to make its decisions by a two&hyphen;thirds majority. This will ensure that decisions of the committee are not dominated by the wishes of any one political party. It will ensure that, if decisions are made that they will be made on the basis of a broad consensus across the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While a plebiscite, preceding a Constitutional Referendum, is the preferred course of action of both our parties, we remain open to any reasonable suggestions from the government, the minor parties or the independents that would enable debate on the Republic to proceed on a constructive basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may well be that some useful ideas and suggestions for alternative processes will emerge from the deliberations of our proposed Joint Parliamentary Committee. That is why we have vested the committee with all the necessary powers to inquire into this matter and to make recommendations to the Parliament as to any alternate courses of action that should be adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But these provisions are merely designed to ensure that Australians get a fair vote on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should the Australian people vote at the plebiscite in favour of a Republic and in favour of making our Head of State an Australian, we would support a process to enable a detailed Republican model to be determined. Again, we believe this process should proceed on a consensus basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may well be determined that the Joint Parliamentary Committee is the best body to undertake this process. If it is determined that it should undertake that role, then the committee should engage in wide&hyphen;ranging and representative consultations with the Australian people before reaching its conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Alternately, it would also be appropriate for a properly constituted People's Convention to consider this issue.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5270"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ultimately, however, the issue of whether Australia becomes a Republic, with an Australian as our Head of State, can only be determined by the Australian people themselves in accordance with section 128 of the Constitution. This will require a referendum to be held on the preferred model for the Republic as determined by the Parliament as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The model proposed today is specifically designed to ensure the maximum degree of consultation with the Australian people at the beginning the middle and the end of the process. The model is also capable of delivering Australia a Republic, if that is the people's wish in time for either the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000 or by the centenary of Federation on 1 January 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In comparison to this we have the attitude to date of the government on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the government has said it remains committed to its election promise to hold a Constitutional Convention, it is clear from its insistence on an undemocratic and un&hyphen;Australian voting system that it is content to see the Convention delayed or scrapped, and the Republic debate put on the back&hyphen;burner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But it is never too late for the government to take a constructive approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is why the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats have put forward this constructive proposal so that all Australians will be able to express their views, at every stage of the process, on this important issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are committed to giving the Australian people a say. We call upon the government and all other members of the Parliament to match that commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether or not the Republic is inevitable is a matter for genuine political debate. But no&hyphen;one in this Parliament can deny that the vast majority of Australians are ready and willing to decide whether they want Australia to become a Republic, whether they want an Australian as our Head of State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We can, and should, take the politics out of this decision and hand it over to the Australian people. But unless we, as politicians, are genuinely willing to do so, we doom discussion of the Republic, or any other issue of constitutional reform, to failure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We should get out of the way and design a process, that we can all agree on, that will allow the Australian people to decide. We urge the government to join us in this opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We commend this bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Joint Standing Committee on Publications is conducting an inquiry into the possible discontinuation of the parliamentary papers series. The inquiry has been initiated in response to a request by the Presiding Officers, who wrote to the committee on 27 June 1996 seeking its advice on a proposal to discontinue the series. In order properly to consider the proposal, the committee sought information and views from interested parties. It has received 58 submissions and has conducted two public hearings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee received a useful submission from the Australian Government Publishing Service and took oral evidence from that organisation on 10 February 1997. Before the committee finalises its report, however, it will need to take additional evidence from the AGPS at a further public hearing. This evidence could cover matters such as the restructuring of the AGPS, its future role, its community service obligations and the revised <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Charter of printing and publishing responsibilities</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee had arranged to take this evidence on Thursday, 19 June, but an injunction was granted by the Federal Court in

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A significant issue to be considered by the committee is the administrative arrangements that will be established, after the sale of the AGPS, to ensure the distribution of parliamentary and executive government documents.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Access to the Internet is of fundamental importance for consumers in the new communications environment. For this reason, the Australian Democrats believe the Internet should remain affordable to all.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5272"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the scope of on&hyphen;line services grows, access to them will become an ever more pressing imperative. The Internet already offers a means for accessing information which is vital for enabling active participation in our society. For example, information on government services, policies and activities is readily available on&hyphen;line. In fact, the Internet is already proving one of the most effective and efficient means of obtaining such information. The projected growth of health and educational services will also contribute to the growth of the Internet as a critical tool for students and families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of accessing the Internet is therefore rapidly becoming a factor for an ever increasing number of families. In time, it is likely to become a cost that is virtually unavoidable&mdash;much like the telephone in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The parliament, therefore, has a duty to ensure that access to the Internet remains affordable. Putting safeguards in place now is a way of ensuring that we do not create an information under&hyphen;class in the near future. That we do not wind up with a society divided into the information&hyphen;rich and the information&hyphen;poor. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, preserving low&hyphen;cost access to the Internet is also an important means of entrenching the dynamic growth in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the efforts of the Democrats, under the Telecommunications Act 1997 (which comes into effect on 1 July 1997), business customers will not be guaranteed ongoing provision of untimed local calls for data. This means business users may be forced to accept timed charges for Internet and other data calls in the not too distant future. This decision, which rests with telecommunications carriers, would add significantly to the costs faced by small businesses and their consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fortunately, residential customers and charitable bodies and welfare organisations are guaranteed ongoing provision of untimed local voice and data calls. This means that these customers are able to connect to an Internet Service Provider in their local call zone, for the purpose of accessing the Internet, at the cost of an untimed call.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telecommunications carriers, however, are not prohibited from charging Internet Service Providers a separate&mdash;timed&mdash;levy for receiving calls (known as B&hyphen;Party charging). This opens the way for all customers (including residential customers and charitable bodies or welfare organisations), to be indirectly charged on a timed basis for accessing the Internet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats do not believe the imposition of such charges is warranted.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Internet Service Providers are charged a timed levy for receiving a calls for the purposes of connecting to the Internet, they will be forced to pass these additional costs on to their customers, through increased fees.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I recognise the assistance of the committee secretariat in the preparation of this report. In particular, I thank Mr Stephen Bull and Ms Helen Eastburn. Ms Eastburn was seconded to the committee from the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legal aid inquiry was referred to the committee on 17 September 1996. Since that time, the committee has received 171 written submissions, has held public hearings in each capital city and tabled the first report on 26 March 1997. The  committee noted in its first report that evidence to the inquiry focused on
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5273"> the government's decision to change the funding arrangements for legal aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This second report of the committee does three things. First, the report documents the further progress in the Commonwealth and state and territory negotiations. The committee understands that all state and territory governments, with the exception of Western Australian, have reached in principle agreements with the Commonwealth government. Two of these agreements&mdash;those with the Queensland and New South Wales governments&mdash;are reported to provide agency type arrangements rather than cooperative agreements. The committee intends to assess closely the terms of the final agreements when they are made public in order to satisfy itself that the arrangements are fair and equitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second aspect of this report is to review further evidence given to the committee at public hearings in Sydney and Perth. At these hearings the committee heard from a broad spectrum of witnesses, including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Western Australia, the Western Australian Attorney-General, the Public Defender of New South Wales, ATSIC, bar associations and law societies, ACOSS, legal aid commissions and public interest groups. The clear message to the government from these hearings is that its decision to change the legal aid system is a serious attack on the justice system and that the small initial savings could lead to far greater economic and social costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the committee addresses four specific terms of reference for the inquiry. In the first instance the report looks at the terms of reference No. 2&mdash;that is, the role and responsibility of governments and the profession in the provision of legal aid. A significant aspect of legal aid in Australia which is often overlooked or not known is that the Commonwealth government has taken a leading policy and funding role over the last 25 years or so. The legal profession provides a significant amount of free or reduced cost assistance to those in need of legal services. This contribution has been valued at $62 million per annum. The committee considers that this contribution by the profession should be recognised, and to this end the committee
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> recommends the establishment of an annual award program for individuals and firms that undertake pro bono work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also heard evidence regarding the considerable scope for improving the provision of legal aid through systematic, innovative cooperative research and development work. The report records the committee's support for the establishment of a fund to coordinate and promulgate  new initiatives for the provision of legal information, advice and education. In the committee's view, this fund could have considerable positive flow&hyphen;on effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the report considers term of reference (3)(a): the impact of Australia's international obligations on legal aid assistance. Importantly, compliance with international obligations depends on results not procedures. The committee notes the Commonwealth government's clear intention to comply with the principles contained in its international obligations in relation to Com monwealth matters, including matters arising under Commonwealth laws giving effect to international obligations. This is a step in the right direction. However, it begs the question of whether the state and territory governments can attain the same level of compliance under the new proposed funding arrangements. The detail of and practice under the post 1 July 1997 agreements will be critical in determining the answer to this question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third issue considered in this report is term of reference (8): the implication for the legal aid system arising from the High Court Dietrich decision. As senators will know, the Dietrich decision established a principle that an indigent accused charged with a serious offence must be represented if he or she is to have a fair trial. If such an accused is not represented a stay of proceedings will be granted. This means that, in order for the trial of such an accused to proceed, representation must be provided at public expense. This in turn may lead to reduced funding being available for other legal services. The committee considers that it is essential for the Commonwealth government to monitor the implications of the Dietrich decision for legal aid funding.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5274">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth issue considered in the report was in term of reference (9): the capacity of the legal aid to provide for separate representation of children where such assistance is essential to the pursuit of justice. It was obvious to the committee from evidence provided to it that separate representation of children had been a source of increased cost to the Australian legal aid system, although it is suggested that these costs may have begun to plateau. The committee recommends that national guidelines be established by the government to ensure appropriate representation in the best interests of the child. It also recommends adequate funding to be made available to legal aid commissions for the provision of legal representation to children, having regard to the guidelines set down by the full court of the Family Court in Re K.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence received in the committee's two reports on legal aid gives me great concern. I am concerned about the uncertain future of Australia's current cooperative legal aid system and that savings may well be illusory as cuts in Commonwealth funding may be offset by increased costs, delays and inefficiencies in the courts. I am also concerned that alternative, innovative efficiency measures are being ignored in the government's zeal to quarantine funding to Commonwealth matters only&mdash;a decision made more difficult in the light of all Australia's interests in the proper administration of justice. Events over the next month or two may demonstrate my concerns to be unfounded. I hope so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has agreed to continue the inquiry and to extend the terms of reference of the inquiry. This will enable the committee to monitor the legal aid system after the new funding arrangements become operational and to report on its outstanding terms of reference. I commend the report to the Senate and I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry into access to medical records was referred to the Committee on 14 December 1996 after Senator Belinda Neal's proposal to amend the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996, to incorporate access to medical records provisions, was unsuccessful.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reference to the Committee was, among related issues, to inquire into a legislative access to medical records scheme to provide patients in the private health sector with a right of access to their medical records.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The background to the amendment concerned a patient's right of access to her doctor's notes. A test case, Breen v Williams in 1994, went to the  NSW Court of Appeal. In 1996, the High Court of Australia confirmed that in the private health sector, the common law confirms ownership of records with the originator of the record.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While patients in the public health sector have access to their medical and other health records under the provisions of Freedom of Information legislation, patients in the private sector must rely upon the cooperation of medical practitioners and other health care providers to provide access to their records.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The High Court advised that if there was to be any change, it was for the Parliament to decide upon legislation which would ensure individuals' access to their medical records in the private health sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of Senator Neal's proposal was to remove this anomaly, to provide access to medical records, and to ensure the privacy of medical and other health records.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the course of the inquiry, the Committee received 60 submissions from parties with an interest in, or associated with, the provision of medical services and held two days of public hearings, receiving evidence from 20 organisations and 36 witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major issues confronting the inquiry concerned access and privacy matters, including the scope of possible Commonwealth legislation, mechanisms to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5275"> protect the interests of patients and third parties against potentially harmful disclosures, appropriate sanctions, exemptions to access, mechanisms for decision making and review of decisions with regard to exemptions, and provision for parliamentary scrutiny and oversight of arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recognised the extent and depth of community concern that patients and consumers in the private health care sector do not enjoy the same right of access to their medical and health records as do those in the public health sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes that there is strong community and consumer support for a national legislative regime which would permit individuals' access to their medical and other health records in the public and private health sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has focused in great measure upon privacy issues and considers that the extension of privacy legislation into the private health sector is essential to protect the confidentiality and accessibility of individuals' medical and other health records.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has also found that there is a need for a national legislative schedule to cover the storage, transfer and destruction of records.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recognises that there are constitutional limitations in the area of health and the need for consultation to reach agreement with the States and Territories for a national access to medical and other health records scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's major recommendations are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the Commonwealth should initiate immediate discussions between all stakeholders in the States and Territories to enable the drafting and passage of legislation to ensure access to medical records for all individuals across the public and private health sectors;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the Commonwealth should move expeditiously to draft legislation for national access to medical and other health records, and extended privacy legislation, to avoid the possibility of conflicting with State and Territory access to medical and other health records legislation being developed;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that national legislation will be prospective in its operation, except where matters of fact are concerned;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that for a national legislative scheme, a broad definition should be adopted to describe information and materials constituting an individual's medical or health record.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Health consumers have been calling for law reform and equity in access to medical records for over a decade. This inquiry has opened up the whole issue to public and parliamentary scrutiny and has
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provided a forum for a discussion of other closely related issues, including the need to protect the confidentiality and privacy of medical and other health records in the health sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This inquiry has presented a challenge to those who contend that the ownership of medical and other health records must continue; it has reviewed legislative access regimes in other countries, and it has produced constructive options for creating an Australian legislative regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee supports the view that national legislation is essential to provide all Australians with a right, subject to specific exemptions, to access to their medical and other health records.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The access to medical records report, as the Senate may recall, was brought about by an amendment I moved to the health insurance amendment bill late last year. In fact I think it was in the last 24 hours before the Senate got up. I must confess that probably that amendment was not ideal in its terms, but it certainly did what I hoped it would do and that was to put the whole issue of access to medical records firmly on the agenda. It has  done so through the Senate inquiry and the report that has been tabled today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report&mdash;and I would commend a quick read, or at least a flick through it&mdash;does a very good summary of the materials, discussion and issues that have been dealt with in the community in relation to this issue over the last few years. It clearly indicates that there is extraordinarily strong community support for continuing the process and providing a more open and accessible process whereby patients of doctors, and also of other health professionals, can obtain access to their medical records.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You may well recall that earlier this year, quite contrary to the views put during the election campaign, the coalition government and the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, indicated that, in fact, they did not intend to extend the privacy legislation. This extension would have included access to medical records, not only for the public sector as it is now, but also for the private sector. This announcement was greeted with a great deal of concern by those
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5276"> people in the community who had relied on the views put by the Prime Minister and other members of his government during the election campaign that certainly one of things they did intend to do was to make sure that access to medical records was available in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also put by people during the debate that there was not a strong view in the community that access to medical records was required. You might note that the 60 submissions received by that committee were not only from a range of organisations involved in the health industry but also from individuals who had had difficulty with obtaining access to their records and, further, who had suffered adverse consequences as a result of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also had contact with a number of people over the period&mdash;and I suppose I will continue to have contact with those people and with new people&mdash;who had had great difficulties with treatment that they had received and, firstly, had been unable to sort out what had occurred and, secondly, had been unable to resolve the health problems that they had because of the lack of information that had been provided about what had taken place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the government will see fit as a result of this report to legislate to provide access to medical records and really create a true relationship of openness and trust between patients and doctors, and not allow the situation to continue as it is at the moment where doctors really are the guardians of knowledge and hand it out as they think fit. I do not mean to imply by that that all doctors are reluctant to give access to their records, but certainly there is a large proportion of medical practitioners who really feel that it is not in the best interests of patients in almost all cases to provide them with access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was argued earlier in the debate that the AMA guidelines that recommended that medical practitioners give access to their medical records was sufficient and it was not necessary to legislate to provide that access. But there are two points that I wish to make very strongly about that proposition. The first is that the AMA has only 50 per cent of the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> medical profession as members. Further, that the code, which is entirely voluntary, does not really suggest that access should be given directly. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a doctor agrees to provide information to a patient from the contents of records concerning the patient's medical treatment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The patient should be informed of all relevant factual information contained in the record.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> However, the doctor's opinions and conclusions recorded in the medical record will be released only at the discretion of the doctor concerned.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So this voluntary code put forward by the AMA as a solution to the problem very clearly says that the relationship is such that the doctor himself or herself should control the release of those records and that it is not a right of the patient to see what is written about them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My view is that there really cannot be proper health care unless patients are equal partners with their doctors in their treatment, are aware of all facts and are involved in all decisions about their health care. I believe this can only be achieved when they are entitled  to see the information that is recorded about them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to thank very much the committee involved with this inquiry for their diligence and hard work. I would also particularly like to thank Sue Rickard in the committee secretariat who worked very hard on the report and has really produced a quality document. I understand she is leaving us now, going overseas and then returning to an academic lifestyle. Thank you, Sue Rickard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I strongly commend the report to the Senate and ask that the government respond to the recommendations contained in there as a matter of priority and as soon as possible.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee conducted Part 3 of this inquiry in response to the rapid pace of change in computer on&hyphen;line services since it last looked at this issue in 1995. The inquiry revealed numerous important developments in the industry. These included not only daily increases in the number of Australian users of on&hyphen;line services but also an increase in the number and the degree of responsiveness of blocking and filtering software, the development of labelling protocols such as the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) and rapid progress towards convergence of the technologies used by various media.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is recommending that governments introduce legislation to regulate the on&hyphen;line industry to ensure that material that cannot legally be distributed through other media should also not be distributed through on&hyphen;line services. In the Committee's view, the legislation should require participants in the on&hyphen;line services industry to develop codes of practice in consultation with
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government, other industry and users and to register those codes of practice with an appropriate body to be determined in the legislation. The Committee is also recommending that appropriate complaints handling procedures be put in place for the benefit of consumers. The Committee believes that failure to abide by the codes of practice should carry financial penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The protection of minors from material that is not suitable for them is an important consideration and the Committee is greatly encouraged by the progress made in the area of blocking and filtering software in less than 2 years since Part 2 of its inquiry. However, parents need to be reminded that the software currently available will often block suitable as well as unsuitable material and that they cannot be relied upon to block out everything that a parent may wish to see blocked.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is therefore recommending that a public education campaign be conducted on the potential impact of computer on&hyphen;line technologies and the rights and responsibilities that they bring with them. The Committee has stressed the need for adequate age verification procedures to be put in place for the protection of minors from certain material now available on&hyphen;line.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The volume of material that is accessible through the use of computer on&hyphen;line services makes the detection of illegal material such as child pornography and paedophilic information, extremely difficult. The Committee believes it would assist both Internet Service Providers and law enforcement agencies if they could be informed, by users who find illegal material, of its location. To this end, the  Committee is recommending the establishment of a phone, fax and e&hyphen;mail hotline where information about such material can be conveyed so that any follow&hyphen;up action can be taken if it proves to be needed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the global nature of the Internet , the Committee has reviewed the measures taken by various overseas countries to prevent the transmission of illegal material through the use of various computer on&hyphen;line services. Measures taken by national governments alone cannot be fully effective in addressing the problem. The Committee is therefore recommending that the federal government continue its efforts internationally to develop appropriate protocols to deal with those who use on&hyphen;line services to conduct criminal activities across national borders.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That regulation 4 of the Workplace Relations Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1997 No. 101 and made under the Workplace Relations Act 1996, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have been a politician now for just one year and I am learning fast that the rules in politics are very different from the rules of business, which is my background. In politics, as in business, I have known what it is to negotiate with tough people and to negotiate on a tough basis. When I first came across the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), I told him not to expect me to be a pushover because I had experience of the Afrikaner ministers in South Africa. He took that to heart. Nevertheless, the 60 hours invested by me and by Senator Kernot in improving the coalition government's original Workplace Relations Act and then giving it passage through this parliament were not easy; they were tough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those negotiations culminated in an agreement which was publicly released. I have it here, and you have seen it before. Nothing has been changed in that. It was signed off by the minister and my leader and it covered every detail of industrial relations law, line by line, comma by comma, including unfair dismissals. It even listed the matters we did not agree on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my business life I could have every expectation that an agreement, once struck, would be honoured. I am learning fast that that is not necessarily the case. Today I am in the reluctant position of having to move this disallowance motion in order to enforce the agreement between the government and the Australian Democrats and in order to overturn

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3M6">Senator MURRAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A breach of faith indeed. I oppose this regulation on policy grounds and I oppose it on political grounds. The regulation, if allowed to stand, would exempt an employee of businesses employing less than 15 employees from any redress if they believed they had been unfairly sacked during their first 12 months of employment. If Mr Reith comes through with his threat of introducing new legislation this afternoon, the exemption might be extended to all employees in small business. Make no mistake, that exemption aims to allow small business to sack employees unfairly. That is the purpose of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To allow the regulation to stand is to create two classes of workers: 1.6 million workers in small businesses who would have no right to challenge an unfair dismissal, and the 6.8 million workers who would. That is a fundamental breach of the government's election commitments to provide a fair go all round for employers and employees on unfair dismissals. Where is the fair go in saying to 1.6 million workers, nearly a quarter of the work force, `The fair go all round does not extend to you. Your employer can be as harsh, as unjust and as unfair as they like and, so long as their actions are still lawful, you can't question it because if you do they can sack you without penalty'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard a lot of noise from ministers about mandates. The minister should check what he told the Australian electorate during the election campaign. During the election campaign, Mr Reith publicly and explicitly rejected the very proposal that he is now seeking to implement. I refer senators to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 20 February 1996 entitled `Small business fails with plea on sacking law'. This article describes how a COSBOA pitch to have an exemption in coalition policy was rejected by Minister Reith. In part, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The author of the policy, the Opposition's industrial relations spokesman, Mr Peter Reith, said the redrafted system would not contain any exemptions.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5280"> </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3M6">Senator MURRAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Nor was the proposal included in the drafting of the original Workplace Relations Act. I want to make that clear: it was not included in the original Workplace Relations Act. There is no mention of the proposal in there. It was not even seriously pursued by the minister in the negotiations with me and Senator Kernot, other than in a half&hyphen;hearted way, very late at night, at one of our last meetings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most importantly, it was not listed within the agreement as one of the matters reserved by the parties as not agreed. We specifically produced a list of items where we said what we did agree with and what we did not agree with. It was not listed. The agreement document, signed by the minister, covered all aspects of the policy, agreed and disagreed. That is why this issue is also about breach of promise, breach of trust, breach of contract and breach of agreement. Today we are being asked by the minister to allow the implementation of a policy that he has twice flatly rejected, on spurious policy grounds, and in breach of an agreement which I take seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One cannot help but wonder whether this regulation was drafted simply in frustration with the hairy&hyphen;chested right within the Liberal Party, led by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), who has privately bagged the Democrat&hyphen;government agreement from day one. The succession rivalry between those two ministers is plain for all to see, with no sign of slowing down&mdash;the latest round being reported only yesterday in the newspapers. Perhaps the Treasurer's line about IR was winning within the all&hyphen;important Liberal caucus and this really is about internal Liberal politics, not about small business and certainly not about jobs. This is not positive, constructive, cooperative workplace relations. In my view, it will be sanctioning employer thuggery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion seeks to disallow regulations issued in April under the Workplace Relations Act. The regulation would exempt an employ
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ee of businesses employing less than 15 employees from the right to apply for redress for unfair dismissal unless the employee has more than 12 months service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats strongly oppose this regulation and would urge all senators to join us in seeking to have it disallowed. We oppose the regulation because it is not fair to strip up to 1.6 million workers of the right to question an unfair dismissal, simply because of the size of the employer. It is not fair to allow employers to sack employees unfairly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, it is a fundamental breach of the government's election commitments. Second, during the election campaign, the coalition was asked by the Council of Small Business Organisations, as I have mentioned already, to exempt small business employers from unfair dismissal. Peter Reith ruled it out. When we finished the agreement we thought this was a dead issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It came to life after Peter Costello and the right wing of the Liberal Party and some employers started criticising Minister Reith's bill as not going far enough. It became an issue only when our much diminished Prime Minister (Mr Howard), shopping around for some diversion to take the heat off this government's appalling record on unemployment, seized on it. Then, stomping over clear election commitments, stomping over the agreement with the Democrats, stomping over the recommendation of their own Small Business Deregulation Taskforce, they brought down this regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Which leads me to my third reason for opposing this regulation. It will not create one single extra job. Even under Laurie Brereton's unfair dismissal laws, the argument that small business employment was being seriously hampered was always nebulous. In 1994&hyphen;95, small business, the small business work force, grew by 6.4 per cent, compared with 3.9 per cent for the work force as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to draw your attention, Senators, to the fair trading inquiry report, unanimously signed by coalition and Labor members. I draw your attention to page 2, item 1.8:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5281">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. in the decade to 1994&hyphen;95, the small business sector accounted for almost all the 1.2 million net increase in jobs, increasing its workforce by an estimated 1.1 million compared to 270 000 for large business and a decline in public sector employment of 150 000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. in 1994&hyphen;5 (the latest year for which data is available) the small business workforce increased by 6.4 per cent, compared with 3.9 per cent for total employment; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. small businesses accounted for almost half of total employment in 1994&hyphen;95.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Come on, that was under the laws that you claimed were restricting employment growth. That was under the laws that you condemned, and they grew at twice the level of large business. So don't tell me that under the reformed Workplace Relations Act you have a problem with jobs growth in small business. Your problem is your policies, not the laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the Yellow Pages <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Small Business Index</EMPHASIS>, the number of small businesses expecting to put on workers  exceeded the number expecting to put them off by 10 to 15 per cent right through to January 1996, but since then, since the Howard government came into power, confidence has plummeted, and only five per cent of firms now expect to employ more. You are not delivering the conditions under which people will employ more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what are the factors that would cause small businesses to employ more? If you believe the Prime Minister, who in a fit of political senility even forgot he had changed the unfair dismissals laws in his new act, the second we get these unfair dismissal laws fixed, each of the 800,000 small business in Australia will immediately set out to employ one each of the 800,000 unemployed Australians. That is not going to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yellow Pages last month looked at the primary concerns of small business, and guess what: `regulations' was pretty low down the list, even after all the Reith&hyphen;Howard propaganda, marked by only seven per cent of the firms. The big issues were lack of work, lack of sales, low cash flow, consumer confidence and competition and fair trading laws. Yet you are busy defending the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Prosser)&mdash;the minister for landlords&mdash;who will not introduce the fair trading laws that are necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A similar result was evident in an earlier survey by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry of its members on ways to raise employment. In that survey, changing unfair dismissal laws ranked seventh out of a list of eight items. Both surveys showed that to create jobs, there is no substitute, no diversion, no smokescreen, that can replace good, sound, forward thinking, confidence boosting economic and small business policy. And small business, big business, the community, manufacturers&mdash;let's tick them off&mdash;are not getting it from this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only 22 per cent of small businesses predicted that the government great <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business</EMPHASIS> statement, of which this unfair dismissal change was the centrepiece, would improve their situation. Sixty&hyphen;six per cent, three times as many, said it would make no difference or make things worse. That is hardly a ringing endorsement, especially from a sector which would prefer no laws at all, because they do not want any regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And small business groups have hardly been falling over themselves to endorse it. The Motor Trades Association represents 40,000 small businesses&mdash;unlike the ACCI, which is a big business organisation with small business members. The MTA, employing over 275,000 workers, made it quite clear that it regarded reform of fair trading laws as the far more important issue, describing it as the crucial test of the government's commitment to generating jobs in small business. The Pharmacy Guild, which is entirely small business, backed up those comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 10,000&hyphen;member Australian Retailers Association has run a similar line, arguing that reform of retail tenancy laws&mdash;a major aspect of fair trading&mdash;was the single most important issue facing their sector. In a letter to the Prime Minister, the association pointed out that occupancy costs now exceed labour costs and that freeing up the tenancy market would massively benefit the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that beefing up the Trade Practices Act to enforce fair trading standards,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5282"> ensuring small business has a fair go in competition with big business, would be of far greater benefit than changes to unfair dismissals. Indeed, the government now has recommendations before it to that effect&mdash;unanimous recommendations&mdash;from the House of Representatives inquiry into fair trading, an inquiry dominated by coalition members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While Mr Prosser is minister for small business&mdash;or rather, minister for landlords&mdash;I am not holding my breath waiting for the government to fix the problem of fair trading. Mr Prosser, a major shopping centre owner, has made clear his firm preference for self-regulation on fair trading&mdash;it is after all in his self&hyphen;interest&mdash;despite and probably because of clear evidence that self&hyphen;regulation does not work. And it would take a `road to Damascus' conversion or a prime ministerial overruling to change the view of the minister for landlords.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This regulation&mdash;part of the government's response to the November report of the Small Business Deregulation Taskforce, which was headed up by the coalition&hyphen;appointed Charlie Bell&mdash;is actually completely contrary to the task force recommendation. That task force, while not reporting on fair trading, noted that the largest number of submissions it received were in regard to that issue. That task force found that, following the passage of the Workplace Relations Act, small business was `cautiously optimistic about the government's approach to amend the unfair dismissal laws'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The task force did not recommend an exemption for small business from unfair dismissal. Have you got that? The task force, set up by you, did not recommend that. They recommended that the operation of the law be reviewed after 12 months to ensure that it is delivering a more balanced and flexible approach to small business. No-one in this chamber would object to a review of that kind, because we are interested in seeing what the facts are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have endorsed that recommendation. The Labor Party has endorsed that recommendation. It is the government that has rejected the recommendation of its own task force in bringing forward this regulation,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> while dragging the chain on the real issues concerning small business like fair trading laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why is small business cautiously optimistic about the new laws? It is because the Workplace Relations Act fixed the unfair dismissal problem. Based on the minister's statistics, the number of unfair dismissal claims dropped by over half, by over 56 per cent. This regulation is trying to fix a non-existent problem about jobs and unfair dismissals and is trying to fix a very real problem between Minister Reith and Minister Costello about who can contest for the Prime Minister's seat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me briefly outline the provisions in the Workplace Relations Act which deal with unfair dismissals and changes we made. Mr Brereton's law put the onus on the employer to show that they had a valid reason to dismiss an employee. Mr Reith's law reverses the onus, requiring an employee to show just how a dismissal was unfair or unjust. Mr Brereton's laws required litigation through the Federal Court, adding to time lines and costs. Mr Reith's laws are dealt with entirely through the AIRC&mdash;a faster and cheaper process. Mr Brereton's laws provided no protection for employers against vexatious or frivolous claims by former employees. Mr Reith's laws allow costs to be awarded against workers who pursue vexatious claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Brereton's laws had mandatory rules about procedures that had to be followed. Mr Reith's laws do not but require all relevant circumstances to be taken into account. Mr Reith's laws require the commission to take into account the viability of the employer  before awarding compensation. Mr Reith's laws extend the exception for probationary employees out to three months, giving employers a fair period, a long period, to determine whether an employee is going to work out. Three months is quite sufficient in a small business to work that out. Mr Reith's laws extend the qualifying period for casual employees out to 12 months before they are eligible to apply for unfair dismissal. They exclude employees who are terminated in accordance with a specified term contract.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5283">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these changes together&mdash;in the view of the government and supported by the Australian Democrats&mdash;were pro&hyphen;small business. We thought they corrected the overly pro&hyphen;union, pro&hyphen;worker bias in former minister Laurie Brereton's old laws. But we are not going to go the next step, which is to say that you can sack workers unfairly. That is what this is about&mdash;the right to sack workers unfairly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new workplace relations laws were predicated on the belief that they would deliver a fair go all round. We accepted that in good faith. We are holding to our side of the agreement but you, I am afraid, are trying to break an agreement, break our trust and break a contract that you have with the Australian people on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those laws are pro&hyphen;employment. They are sensible and workable and should be given a chance. To simply say to 1.6 million workers `No, you can't have access to those laws because you are employed by a small business' is to perpetrate a gross injustice. I think ultimately your regulation would be to the detriment of small business. Knowing employees can be sacked without good cause would encourage sloppy management practices, which would lead to lower worker morale, lower productivity and poorer standards. It could lead to higher wage costs for small business, as employees would baulk at working for one employer when there is no legal protection. It would encourage unions to be extremely aggressive on the small business front. Most importantly, even if this regulation did get up, it still would not disguise the fact that small business is unable to put on employees because of the weakness in the Australian economy and the unfairness of competition against big business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What precedent would it create to say, `We will strip workers' rights to prop up small business'? It could be the dismissal laws this year; it could be the superannuation guarantee payment next year; it could be an exemption from the award safety net the year after. The arguments are exactly the same: to discriminate against employees on the basis of the size of their employer is utterly and complete
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ly unfair. It is unfair, counterproductive and insupportable. Therefore, we commend the disallowance of this regulation to the Senate. </PARA></SPEECH>

I think, Senator Murray, you should cast your mind back and certainly read the warnings that we gave on that occasion about what we believed would be the slow, gradual attempt of this Liberal government to strangle the rights of workers in this country. The regulations that we are, I hope, going to disallow today are a continuing attempt by the Liberal government to strangle the rights of workers in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

I only hope that you are a good deal more sceptical in future about such arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In dealing with the issue before the Senate today I will reflect very briefly on the Labor government's provisions with respect to unfair dismissals. Labor believed that unfair dismissal provisions should apply to all employers irrespective of their size. Labor did, however, have an exclusion in respect of a number of classes of employees. These included employ ees serving a probationary period, provided the period was determined in advance and was reasonable and having regard to the nature and circumstances of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberals' unfair dismissal provisions, as provided by the Workplace Relations Act, which we debated for some two weeks last year&mdash;I think it was the second longest debate in recent history in the Senate chamber, and this issue was certainly considered very
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5284"> extensively&mdash;applied to all employers irrespective of their size. The provisions did, however, exclude a number of classes of employees, including employees serving a probationary period provided the period was determined in advance and the period was either three months or more than three months and was reasonable having regard to the nature and circumstances of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberals' new small business exemption regulations will, I hope, be prevented as a consequence of this debate in the Senate today. The small business regulation, as tabled in the Senate, will exempt small business employers from the unfair dismissal provisions but only for certain employees. The unfair dismissal provisions will not apply to employees where: the employer's undertaking employs no more than 15 employees; the employee was first employed by that employer on or after 1 July 1997; or the employee has been employed by the employer for more than three months or on a regular and systematic basis for a sequence of periods of employment during a period of more than 12 months. In other words, the regulations effectively create a 12&hyphen;month probationary period for new employees of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been Minister Reith's response to our attempts to overturn the regulations that we are considering in the Senate today? Minister Reith, on behalf of the Liberals, has threatened a wider small business exemption if we overturn these regulations today. He has threatened that, in the case of small business, there will be an exemption for small business employers from the unfair dismissal provisions in respect of all employees in all circumstances. Put simply, the unfair dismissal provisions would not apply to employers who employ more than 15 employees. In other words, if you are employed by a small business employer who employs fewer than 15 employees, you have no rights. That is fundamentally unacceptable to the Labor Party&mdash;to take away any right of an employee because they work for a small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to touch on the arguments against the small business exemption regulation that is being tabled in the Senate. Firstly, as I have already noted&mdash;and as we have
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> already considered in a very lengthy debate last year&mdash;the government has already changed the unfair dismissal laws. The unfair dismissal laws were extensively amended by the government's Workplace Relations Act and those changes came into effect on 1 January this year. Both the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and Minister Reith have been praising their own new laws. Mr Reith said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is replacing Labor's arrangements with a new unfair dismissal scheme&mdash;a system which provides employees with access to a fair and simple process of appeal against dismissal, based on the principle of a fair go all round. It is a scheme that . . . ensures legalism is minimised, while discouraging frivolous and malicious claims.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am proud to say that the previous government's . . . unfair dismissal laws have gone. They have been replaced with a simpler, more balanced system that provides a fair go all round.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And, on another occasion, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have swept away Labor's . . . unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He said, `We have swept them away.' What are we doing in the Senate today, if they have been swept away? The evidence so far has shown that changing the unfair dismissal laws has not improved employment. ABS statistics show that since January 1997 in Victoria&mdash;and we look at Victoria because that is a state where the new unfair dismissal laws, so heralded by Minister Reith and the Prime Minister, apply to all employees&mdash;employment trends have been negative since January 1997. In the very month in which these new unfair dismissal laws, so much hailed by Minister Reith and the Prime Minister, came into effect, unemployment went up in Victoria. Employment in Victoria took a nosedive. Employment growth in Victoria decreased by 100 in February, 600 in March, 1,200 in April and  it has been accelerating. As a consequence of the Liberals' new unfair dismissal laws, unemployment has been accelerating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the proposal creates an exemption to the government's own unfair dismissal laws. The proposal will exempt small business from the operation of the government's own unfair dismissal laws, not Labor's. The proposal is inconsistent with the government's
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5285"> strong support for its own unfair dismissal laws that I referred to earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the government's unfair dismissal laws should be given a chance to operate&mdash;although, on current evidence, they are in fact doing exactly the opposite to what was predicted. These laws have only been in operation for five months. They should be given a chance to operate. Minister Reith says that his other industrial relations reforms should be given time to work. What is different about unfair dismissals? The government's unfair dismissal laws already provide a probationary period for new employees, and I have referred to this probationary period in my earlier comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, the proposed exemption is inconsistent with the recommendation of the Bell report. The Bell report only recommended that Minister Reith's new unfair dismissal provisions be reviewed after 12 months of operation. They did not make a recommendation for any exemption for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed exemption is inconsistent with the government's pre&hyphen;election guarantees&mdash;not that that has been a problem in respect of a whole range of other broken promises and so-called non&hyphen;core promises that have been breached by this government since it was elected. At no time prior to the election did the Liberals foreshadow an exemption from unfair dismissal laws for small business. In fact, a small business exemption was ruled out. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 20 February 1996, then shadow minister Mr Reith stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition has flatly ruled out any exemption for small business in its redrafted unfair dismissal laws, despite a plea that the sector should not be subject to the same treatment as `the big end of town' . . . The author of the policy, the Opposition's industrial relations spokesman, Mr Peter Reith, said the redrafted system would not contain any exemptions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On 28 February 1996 the now minister, Mr Reith, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Look, our position's very clear. If you've been unfairly dealt with at work, then you should have a right of appeal.</PARA>

The government admitted this during recent estimates hearings.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are right, Senator Collins, it gets worse. The proposal does not distinguish between unfair dismissal claims on the basis of the merits of the case. To the contrary, the proposal merely distinguishes between claims on the basis of the size of the employer. If you work for a large employer you have human rights. If you work for a small employer you do not have human rights. It is a fascinating new principle that the Liberals are establishing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston, you know nothing about industrial relations or what it is like to struggle on the workplace floor. The concept is that if you work for a small employer you have no human rights and if you work for a large employer you have human rights. It is the fascinating new Liberal principle. Senator Alston, find this new Liberal principle in the coalition's election promises that you went to election with. Find this fascinating new principle in what Minister Reith and Prime Minister John Howard have said over the last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposal is fundamentally unfair to employees. The small business exemption will discriminate against employees who work in small business. They do not have protection against unfair dismissals whereas employees in bigger establishments do. The proposal is fundamentally unfair to decent employers who do the right thing. Labor acknowledges that the vast majority of employers do the right thing. Why should they have to compete with shonky operators who can misuse the new exemption they will have. Numerous examples have been brought to the parliament's attention in recent times by my colleague the shadow minister Mr McMullan. He has produced numerous examples, much to the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> embarrassment of Minister Reith and the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, that they have been unable to refute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business has fewer unfair dismissal claims than other employers. Statistics from the 1995-96 Industrial Relations Court annual report show that small business has fewer unfair dismissal claims than other employers. The unfair dismissal filing rate is slightly under two per cent of all monthly involuntary terminations. Only one&hyphen;third of this figure is from the small business sector, notwithstanding that 91.7 per cent of employers have fewer than 20 employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next point that I would like to make is that the proposal may be a disincentive to small business. The proposal may actually discourage small business from taking on new employees beyond the total staff of 15. And why is there this magic number of 15? Why should an employer with, say, 14 employees take on new employees if it means unfair dismissal laws will then apply? The proposal may encourage artificial employment arrangements. A business with 30 employees would be better off setting up two separate companies employing 15 employees each, thereby escaping the unfair dismissal laws. This will add to the complexity; it will not make doing business simpler.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, unfair dismissals are not a high priority for small business. In surveys of small business, unfair dismissal, if it was an issue, ranked very low or not at all. For example, in the May 1997 Yellow Pages <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Small Business Index</EMPHASIS>, unfair dismissal laws do not rate as a prime concern of small businesses, whereas lack of sales is a concern for 21 per cent of small businesses. That is what the small business community wants&mdash;a return to some consumer confidence. That confidence is sadly lacking; it has been  wrecked as a result of the last two Liberal budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only three per cent of small businesses regard the cost of employing&mdash;which includes the impact of unfair dismissal laws&mdash;as a barrier to entry, whereas 32 per cent regard the lack of cash flow as a barrier and 23 per
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5287"> cent regard lack of work as a barrier. Only 15 per cent of small businesses are even aware of the government's proposed unfair dismissal exemptions and, of those, only one in five believe the initiative will improve the situation for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An earlier ACCI survey ranked dismissal laws as a distant seventh out of eight as the main impediment to employment, well behind lack of sales, a weak economy and profitability. They are the critical issues that face small business&mdash;and big business for that matter&mdash;in today's economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Small Business Health Index</EMPHASIS> stated that almost 60 per cent of small businesses surveyed considered that John Howard's response to the Bell report would not help them. I suspect the only change to this survey of small business concerns would be that today the No. 1, and probably the No. 2, concern of small business is the performance of the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Prosser. I suspect that is the only change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding my contribution on behalf of the Labor Party to this debate, let me say that there is no good reason that can be advanced for changing the treatment of employees regarding small business and unfair dismissal. There is no good reason that has been advanced by the government; in fact, it is all to the contrary. This debate has shown the gross dishonesty of the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Reith, and of particularly the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, whom I have quoted here today, both before and since the election on this fundamental issue. And Labor believes it is a fundamental issue that employees, whether they work for small or big business, have a fundamental right to be protected in the event of harsh, unfair and unjust dismissal.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy President, a contract under law normally is meant to be binding for two parties. There are conditions under which people sign up and, one would assume, under some sort of  legal contract&mdash;and certainly one that has been registered&mdash;
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">there is an assumption that both sides will be required to keep to the terms of the contract. That is, if each party observes their side of the contract, then that contract is binding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Isn't it interesting that the government here seems to be saying, `No, the contract is only one&hyphen;sided'? The employee has to abide by their side of the contract, but the government is really keen to see that the employer does not have to do so. The government says that, if an employer, for unfair reasons, dismisses somebody, that is okay&mdash;even if that person has in fact abided by all that is required of them under their contract of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People will know that it was not the Greens (WA) who pushed for individual contracts and that it was not the Greens (WA) who pushed for workplace agreements. Workplace agreements came up under the previous Labor government, but we have moved more and more towards individual contracts. This was the coalition government's entire strategy on employment creation, but it has not worked. But, when something has not been working, instead of looking at what is going wrong with their employment or lack of employment strategies, they decided to try again with what did not work the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the workplace relations bill, under unfair dismissal, we know there was an agreement between the Australian Democrats and the government to further limit the rights of workers. That was going to be the saviour of employment in Australia, but that did not work. But why should a further racheting down of workers' rights work any better? I am pleased to see that the Australian Democrats have realised that things may have gone too far and that, instead of the government saying, `We will try this, and this is what everybody wants', and then realising it was not the answer, saying, `Let's try it a bit more'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know I have said this before but, ironically, it is things such as consumer confidence, as Senator Sherry said, that have more impact on the current situation with small business than such things as whether workers' rights can be removed so that they can be sacked
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5288"> unfairly. It is about whether or not people feel that they can spend some of their discretionary income&mdash;that is, that income that is above the minimum income for things such as rent, a mortgage or food, the basic necessities of life. So it is that discretionary income that people hold back&mdash;if they have any, that is, when you consider the growing number of working poor in Australia&mdash;when they are uncertain about their future, when they are not sure whether they will be thrown on the unemployment heap. That will have more of an impact on small business than anything the coalition government is putting up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to look at integrated policies. We have to look at what is causing structural unemployment. We have to look at the kinds of business and corporate decisions and directions and policy decisions that are causing structural unemployment in this country. Instead of dealing with that, once again we are pointing to those people who are most affected by these decisions, and we are saying, `If only business could be allowed to treat employees more unfairly', and, `If only you would let us make sure that contracts are not binding for employers but are binding only for employees, then things would be okay.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do you expect people to have faith in this system? Yesterday we heard Senator Newman talking about the necessity for people to have faith in the social security system. Just to make sure, she had thrown off 80,000 people who, in many cases, have no means of support. I know&mdash;those people come into my office. And I know that other people feel the same thing&mdash;people who have been unfairly thrown off for reasons of filling out the wrong form or for some reason they did not know about. They then have to go back and fight their case. You are prepared to do that&mdash;to create uncertainty for people who have no other means of support, to create greater fear and uncertainty amongst those people with the least bargaining power in our workplace. And now you are suggesting that this is the answer, `Let's take it a ratchet further.' I do not believe it is the answer and I for one will not be supporting the

You are seeing through the prism of the union movement, who rely on these things to so-called protect workers' rights, to be able to justify your existence. But the very reason that small business does not want to belong to trade unions is that they know that you are not acting in their interests at all. People are leaving the union movement in droves because they do not want to be strangled. They want people who are in favour of enabling them to expand their businesses. The fact is that this type of restriction simply does not allow for that. The regulation is pro jobs and pro small business.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This motion is in two parts. At the outset, I wish to acknowledge the provision of some useful background material from Mr Lee's office and also Senator Herron's office. If this motion is passed, the two issues for review by the Community Affairs References Committee relate, firstly, to the fairness of recent settlements offered by the Commonwealth government to recipients of human pituitary hormones; and, secondly, whether a range of departments and agencies, including CSL, the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Department of Health and Family Services, have failed to adequately protect public safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a much vexed issue. It has been in the public domain for many, many years. Significant concerns have been expressed by members of the public in the last five or 10 years. Its background is on the public record and may be summarised as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">CSL was established by the Commonwealth government in 1916 to help meet the needs of an isolated nation at war. In 1964 CSL became involved in the preparation of hormones derived from pituitary glands at the time of autopsy. Between 1965 and 1985, 170,000 pituitary glands were collected by CSL. A total of 2,100 people received pituitary hormone treatment: 1,400 for infertility, and 700 for short stature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1971 the issue of danger from unconventional slow viral infections transmitted by hormones from collected glands was first raised in the public domain. The first case of person to person transmission of Creutzfeld-Jakob disease was not reported, I am advised, until 1974. CJD is a rare and fatal brain disease. The program initiated by CSL was
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5292"> suspended in 1985, and collection of the glands ceased in 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that, as at August 1995, five cases of CJD had been reported. CJD continues to occur on a sporadic basis. The average incubation time is something in the order of 12 to 15 years. Recent suggestions in a range of public forums have extended that period now to 25 to 30 years. In May 1993 the previous government commissioned a report conducted by Professor Allars, a law professor at the University of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that a large number of claims are still outstanding in the Victorian Supreme Court, and there has been no progression of those claims since their lodgment in the registry. Those claims are novel because none of the claimants have contracted the disease. This directly relates, of course, to the lengthy incubation period of some 25 to 30 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the follow-up to the Allars report, concerning the implementation of recommendations, the committee hopes to address in a public forum issues such as whether there has been full and adequate disclosure of all relevant documents made to that inquiry. It also wishes to address the human element of those persons involved in this terrible problem by determining whether legal aid has been unfairly withheld from those claimants or plaintiffs. In paragraph 2 of the terms of reference, the committee will examine whether a range of Commonwealth departments and agencies, in whatever form, and former companies have adequately protected public safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, this is a relatively defined inquiry. I am hopeful that it can be concluded by the end of August. The essential thrust is to examine the issue of fairness to those who suffer, or who might suffer, from this most terrible disease of CJD.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While I support all that Senator Bishop has said&mdash;and all that he is trying to do with this particular reference, and we will be supporting the reference&mdash;I am very disappointed to see that this is yet another backflip from the ALP in what has been a week of backflips. I spent a lot of time discussing with
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shadow minister Michael Lee the need to broaden this inquiry so we were not just looking at products where people were possibly facing CJD. We were going to have a broader inquiry to move away from just the pituitary hormone products and look at vaccines, blood products, et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This would have enabled the committee to look at issues such as the role of CSL in the issue of vaccine testing on wards of the state, particularly in Melbourne as revealed recently in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. We would have been able to look at the role of the CSL, the Commonwealth department of health and the NHMRC in the production, regulation and use of a range of different products. By taking out these words, we have restricted this inquiry to one issue. Yes, it is a very important issue and it has needed an inquiry for a long time, but it is most disappointing to see the range of issues we are not going to be able to look at. I would like an explanation from the ALP as to why this restriction has come about and why they have decided to go down this path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am only going to give a couple of examples of issues that we now cannot look at. There was work done in 1963, for example, looking at the influence of a particular anabolic steroid on children. It had nothing to do with human pituitary trials, and therefore we cannot look at it. Norethandrolone was also used on short children. It says right at the front of the paper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Caution is necessary because each anabolic steroid is potentially androgenic and there are no satisfactory reports concerning their androgenic side effects.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was supported by the NHMRC. As I said, that was 1963. Some people are arguing, `What does that really matter? We are looking at one issue and what is happening in the present.' I think we need to go back to look at the particular processes. I think it will give us a view into what is happening in the NHMRC as it is now structured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eventually, at the end of this research, it was decided that the possibility of any improvement was too remote to justify ethically the treatment of a large number of children, so it was only ever done on a relatively small number. The observations basically came back
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5293"> that there was no real effect. Then two years later they started another trial. In this particular instance the trial was on girls and the management of the stature of girls. Why were these particular children subjected to testing? I will give you a couple of quotes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some girls feel so embarrassed with boys shorter than themselves that they believe their choice of male companions, both in the immediate future and as adults, will be seriously jeopardised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">They may have difficulty in buying clothes appropriate to their age, and if clothes have to be tailor&hyphen;made, extra expenses can be a problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some careers, for example, classical ballet, are closed to an unusually tall girl.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A woman taller than average is only rarely suffering from organic disease . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But these trials went ahead anyway. Page 212 of this report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general, treatment was given to control the stature of any girl in whom the estimated mature stature was more than 177.7 cm.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In girls whose estimated mature stature was regarded as too small to justify treatment, reassurance was given that they would not grow to an excessive degree.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The particular hormone used was stilboestrol. In reports now we find that this is a cause of vaginal cancer in girls whose mothers had taken this drug in the first three months of pregnancy to reduce the risk of losing the baby. Later reports have since confirmed this relationship. Some treated girls went on to gain enormous amounts of weight and indeed became obese. Now that we have this narrowed down version of reference, we cannot look into these issues. These are just extra examples of where we cannot now go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to move to the present. I think we need to answer some questions about the present, particularly now that CSL has a different structure and is supposed to be making a profit. As it is now privatised, pressure is on for it to be economic. I will raise a few questions and perhaps the minister can answer these. Is it correct that the messages we are getting about the pressure on CSL to mix blood to produce products for Australia is only being stopped because the Red Cross will not have a bar of it? As they
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are the major collection agency in this country, so far it is not happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The charge is that the watchdog, the federal government, is basically not interested. It is a company now; it is out to make a profit. They have blood coming in from other countries, particularly from Asia, that they treat and send back to those countries or they prepare products and send back to those countries. It is a process that supposedly we are monitoring and preventing from happening, but we cannot ask questions about that now. We cannot ask questions that have come to our notice about the possibility of contamination of vaccines with live viruses. We cannot do any of that.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically the government is saying to us, `Don't delve into CSL. We don't really want to know. We want to limit this inquiry to as narrow an issue as we possibly can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased that the inquiry is getting up, as it was the Democrats who originally started pushing for one. Indeed, it was Senator John Coulter in 1995, around the time that laboratories were being sold, who started raising some of these issues. In that case, the Labor Party and the Liberal Party voted together to scuttle the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am now pleased to see that we at least have an inquiry getting up and that we are going to stop the pressure on the recipients to accept compensation until it is over. We are talking about some 2,500 who have had to wait far too long for something to be done. I want to stress that, while we are pleased that an inquiry is getting up, I really would like to know why the minister and the department of health are not happy to look more fully into what is happening with CSL.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, let me say to Senator Lees that I will take those questions on notice and get back to her.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5294">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We certainly recognise that it is the will of the Senate that there be some form of inquiry into this matter. We welcome the fact that Senator Bishop has confined his motion to matters relating to the pituitary hormones program. In fact, it is solely for this reason that the government does not oppose&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I was saying, it is solely for this reason that the government does not oppose Senator Bishop's amended terms of reference. Paragraph 2 of the original motion was a Pandora's box just waiting to be opened. It had unlimited scope to inquire into a broad range of human biological products above and beyond the CJD issue at the heart of the senator's concerns. This would have answered no questions, invited all sorts of unsubstantiated allegations and conspiracy theories, and would have done so under privilege. I welcome the Labor Party's responsible recognition of the concerns that the government has raised and I refer to the matter as previously raised in 1995 by Senator Coulter and the problems then raised in relation to blood products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, we are not convinced of the need for an inquiry, but we are prepared to accept an inquiry in the terms of Senator Bishop's amended motion on the understanding that the inquiry will not be a re&hyphen;run of the Allars inquiry and that it will be conducted with sensitivity and understanding. We therefore do not oppose the amended motion. I would, however, like to point out and put on the record that the government is concerned that the terms of reference for the inquiry, as proposed in this motion, will not deliver what the Senate intends to achieve through the reference to this committee. It may result in replacing uncertainty for hormone recipients, who have suffered enough, with even more uncertainty. I hope that I am wrong in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the legal aid aspect is concerned, this could establish an unhelpful precedent and could risk politicising individual legal aid funding decisions which need to be made objectively and on the merits of individual cases. I might point out that there is a suppression order in relation to one of the mat
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ters, as I understand it, and there is correspondence from the solicitors for one of the people involved asking that the identity of that person be kept confidential. This motion requires the tabling in parliament of material which was provided in support of an application for legal aid funding and would involve the disclosure of financial or other circumstances provided to the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department in confidence. The government is not prepared to breach that applicant's confidentiality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a longstanding practice, endorsed by successive Attorneys&hyphen;General from any political persuasion, to treat applications for financial assistance in this regard in confidence. The practice accords with the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988 in relation to information provided by natural persons and the general law on breach of confidence. Most of the information in the present case was supplied to the government for the purpose of the administration of the legal aid program in the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. Noting that one of the criteria for granting assistance is hardship to the applicant it is necessary that the applicant disclose details of financial circumstances and other information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the confidentiality of such information could not be maintained there is a substantial risk that persons having legitimate applications for assistance would be dissuaded from making such applications. This would prejudice the operation of the legal aid scheme administered by the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. This result would be contrary to the public interest. The public interest and test case scheme is a form of legal aid provided directly by the Commonwealth. The vast majority of legal aid in Australia is provided through state and territory legal aid commissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators should note that in New South Wales, for instance, there is not only a longstanding convention by successive Attorneys&hyphen;General not to release confidential information about individual applicants but there is also a statutory prohibition on disclosure. Indeed, similar secrecy requirements are imposed in the state of Western Australia. This motion is asking the Commonwealth to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5295"> disclose information in relation to applicants that are made to it and could not be obtained from legal aid commissions in the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the government resists those aspects of the motion which would identify successful applicants on the basis that this would be contrary to the principles of the general law of breach of confidence and would be contrary to the public interest. Given that it is the clear will of the Senate that this motion proceed, the government will not oppose this matter having set out the reservations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too welcome this inquiry into aspects of CJD, the government's response to the Allars report, the treatment of the recipients of human pituitary hormones and whether certain government bodies&mdash;or other bodies, for that matter&mdash;failed to protect public safety. This has been a matter of interest to me for some considerable time. I am really very happy to see and to support the reference of this matter to the Community Affairs References Committee that is chaired by Senator Bishop. I am sure Senator Bishop and other senators on that committee will do a fine job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of the human pituitary hormone program is a history of broken rules. Women seeking help for infertility, and men and women of short stature were essentially guineapigs in an unlawful experiment which has so far killed four women and one man. Another woman is currently being assessed by medical authorities for suspected CJD. Recently, as a result of my questions in estimates committees, it was revealed that blood and tissue supplies included donations from people who later died of CJD.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every day, recipients live with the possibility that they could be living incubators of the human equivalent of mad cow disease. I hope and pray that they can do so peacefully within themselves. A number of people take things differently. The Commonwealth government and the Commonwealth parliament have a responsibility in this area. I am very pleased to see this inquiry getting off the ground.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), CJD is linked with a similar disease in sheep called scrapie. It causes spongy formations in the brain. Symptoms include loss of balance and coordination, decline of mental faculties sometimes leading to dementia, jerking movements and rigidity prior to death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should note that hormone recipients were frustrated from the outset in their attempt to launch a compensation claim. They were denied legal aid. As the plaintiffs' lawyers pointed out, there was an inherent conflict in that the defendant&mdash;the Commonwealth&mdash;was the arbiter in granting or denying the application for legal aid. On top of this extreme financial handicap, documents essential to the recipients' case were kept from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of the program is a history of broken rules. The report of Professor Margaret Allars, who was commissioned to examine the use of pituitary hormones in Australia, is a damning indictment of the program. Allars found, amongst other things, that CSL had not met all the requirements of the Australian regulatory authorities to manufacture and distribute hormones. Describing the program as `unlawful' and `experimental', she found that many participants were not informed of the experimental nature of the program or of the fact that the hormones came from human tissues taken from dead bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first guideline for selecting women for the program was that they should not be ovulating. However, ovulating women were given hPG. Allars also refers to other experiments including super ovulation for use in IVF experiments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia was the only country to provide for a government sponsored program making hPG available free of charge to patients. Between 1967 and 1968, more than 2,500 people were treated with human pituitary gonadotrophin or human growth hormone manufactured from human pituitary glands taken from cadavers&mdash;hPG is the fertility hormone and hGH is a growth hormone administered to children of short stature.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5296">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">CSL collected the glands, manufactured and distributed the products. A total of 171,091 pituitary glands were collected from dead bodies, with removal carried out mainly by mortuary staff who were paid a fee for each gland collected. Relatives had not given their consent for harvesting the glands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr P. Schiff&mdash;CSL's representative on the Human Pituitary Hormone Advisory Committee and responsible to the Minister for Health in overseeing the program&mdash;advised the gland collectors that `unless the body is badly decomposed, it is never too late to take the gland'. In other words, decomposing body parts could be removed and processed for use in living humans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1966, CSL issued criteria to exclude pituitary glands taken from people who had died from certain diseases, among them viral hepatitis. In 1971, the College of Pathologists recommended that neurological diseases, including slow viruses, be added to the list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, according to Professor Allars, neurological diseases were removed from the list of exclusions in 1977. Allars stated that CSL was warned in 1966 that viruses would not necessarily be eliminated in the hormone manufacturing process. There was enough information in 1966 to indicate that the program should not have been allowed to proceed. But it did, and the women I referred to, who only wanted help to have babies, lost their physical and mental health and their lives because of it. The Australian pituitary hormone program was closed down in May 1985 after two hGH recipients in the US died from CJD. The first Australian woman died in 1988. There were two subsequent deaths, yet the department of health waited until 1991 to advise those people who had been on the program of those deaths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All overseas cases involving hormone recipients have been settled in favour of the recipients. In France, some of those responsible for the French pituitary growth hormone program have been prosecuted and could be imprisoned. But in Australia no&hyphen;one has been prosecuted and no&hyphen;one has admitted fault. This goes to the next point I am making. There are so many things done by persons who are imbued with the idea that the techno
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> logical imperative should prevail. This is happening in a whole range of areas, particularly when it comes to women's health. I will deal with that at a subsequent stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I welcome this inquiry, I must register my disappointment with the opposition for removing the reference to human biological products from the terms of reference. The whole CJD episode is a window into lax processes and cover&hyphen;ups by those responsible for regulating human experimentation and by those whose grave duty it is to ensure the highest standards in the regulation and manufacture of biological products derived from blood, tissues and organs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A broad inquiry has been necessary for a long time. For too long the manufacturers of Australian products of human biological origin, made for the Commonwealth on behalf of the Australian people, have consistently failed in their mission and evaded discovery. The harvesting of organs and other human tissues or fluids for vaccines, hormone preparations and other biological products used by millions of Australians has not always met these high standards. As brought to light recently, blood donors have died of CJD. This demands further investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know, too, that CSL Ltd has secretly mixed Australian and foreign plasma over the decades. Until now, the Therapeutic Goods Administration has shown itself to be inadequate in its ability to regulate products of biological origin. I have had cause to be quite critical of the Therapeutic Goods Administration in various other areas. This is not a criticism of the minister or the parliamentary secretary. Under their sharp eye, no doubt things have improved vastly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems that I alluded to really boil down to a betrayal of public safety and cannot continue. It is my hope that the committee commissioned to conduct the inquiry concerning matters relating to CJD recipients will recognise that there are related matters which also deserve detailed consideration. I wish the committee every success.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Clause 1-2, page 2 (lines 10 and 11), omit "on a day or days to be fixed by Proclamation", substitute "on 1 January 1998".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When we concluded yesterday, we had dealt with the government's three amendments. We now proceed to deal with the opposition's amendments, firstly amendment No. 1. This amendment seeks to specify the date of commencement of the act as 1 January 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some very good and cogent reasons for this amendment. The first issue is the fact that the bill states that the act will commence on a day to be fixed by proclamation. It was originally proposed by the minister that this act should come into force on 1 July. That was the position put by the government in the August budget of 1996 when the structural reform of aged care was announced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think there would be a person involved in the aged care sector who believed it was ever going to be possible for this package and this quite detailed, voluminous legislation to commence operation on 1 July as had been announced by the government. For a start, the authorising legislation was not introduced into the parliament until 26 March 1997. That was only three months prior to the intended date of commencement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have since then had the minister recognise that that date of 1 July was extremely optimistic and propose that it now commence operation on 1 October. Of course, the act does not specify that. That is what the government hopes it can achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many outstanding issues to be resolved with people in the aged care sector before one can be certain that the implications of the act are fully understood. For example, it has been only in the last couple of days that a position has been reached on the amount of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5298"> the concessional resident subsidy. The minister has been forced to rethink that issue on at least two occasions, and it was really only two days ago now that the announcement came that a deal had been worked out with the Democrats to get their support for dealing with the legislation this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are clearly people out there who still have to assess what is going to be the impact of that announcement on concessional resident subsidy, because it is less than what was clearly identified by the industry as being the minimum appropriate amount needed&mdash;that is, $12 per resident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are yet to see the final form of the principles that will be attached to this legislation. Indeed, many of the important elements of this legislation and its impact are really going to be known only when the principles are finalised and in operation. The latest exposure draft, the revised exposure draft on the Aged Care Bill principles, in itself runs to about 290&hyphen;odd pages on top of a bill that is 370 pages. I am advised that comments are still coming in and that the date for that process to be finalised is tomorrow. So it is going to be some time yet before we know fully what the principles will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would submit that it is premature&mdash;to say the least&mdash;and indeed reckless to be trying to put this legislation through this chamber this week simply because it is the last week of the session before the winter recess. I believe that that is the position that many in the industry and indeed the Democrats themselves would really subscribe to, notwithstanding their agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might point out, for the benefit of Senator Woodley, because I think he has probably forgotten this&mdash;and this also relates to issues that we were discussing yesterday&mdash;that the Democrats recommended in their dissenting report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Democrats recommend that the commencement date for the aged care structural reforms be delayed until information concerning all the issues is available, outstanding problems and concerns have been resolved and the impact of the proposed reforms have been fully explored and debated, but no later than 1 January 1998.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is your recommendation, Senator Woodley. That committee report, as you know, was tabled only a few days ago. So it is hard to believe and accept that, in the space of a couple of days, all of these outstanding problems and concerns could have been resolved that would lead you to a position to say, `Yes, we now feel confident that this legislation can come into force from 1 October.' That is just plainly untenable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our proposal is one that I would think the Democrats particularly should subscribe to&mdash;notwithstanding their eleventh-hour agreement&mdash;that there should be a date later than 1 October, that the date should be specified in the legislation so there is certainty out there in the industry and in the aged care sector, and that that date should be 1 January next year. If the government have a good hard think about this, they themselves must know that it is impossible to really get everything resolved before 1 October.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say that the sector needs certainty. There are major changes which will occur as a result of this legislation. You only have to consider the implications of the accommodation bonds proposal. We do ask the government and the Democrats and the Independents and the other parties in the Senate to think seriously about, and support, our amendment for a specified operative date in the legislation of 1 January 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also refer to some of the myriad of correspondence that I have received from various nursing homes and aged care institutions and organisations in recent days. I understand that they have also been sent to many other members of parliament. For instance, a letter from the Leichhardt Uniting Church Homes and Community Services&mdash;and this is yesterday, so this is after the Democrat-government deal&mdash;comments about the impacts of this bill and new operational funding arrangements. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I attach for your information a summary sheet from our working party of `grass root practitioners' which clearly indicates that the ratings as they currently exist will create chaos if introduced on October 1st.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And they have some 550 residents in their care. Similarly, there is a letter from the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5299"> Diocese of Maitland-Newcastle Catholic Care of the Aged, dated 19 June. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only in the last few days have I and my staff gained access to the Resident Classification Scale Weightings which enable residential aged care providers to estimate their future income following the reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are still undertaking this exercise as it is quite time consuming, however it is becoming obvious that all of our nursing homes and hostels will lose significant sums of money.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then they give some examples. They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We implore your assistance in the debate in the Senate to stop the passage of the Aged Care Bill and associated legislation until more adequate assessment of its impact is completed and until we can be sure the new legislation will result in improvement rather than deterioration of aged care services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have a similar letter from a nursing home in the area that I live in, which is the Sutherland shire in Sydney. This comes from the Stella Maris Hostel/Nursing Home at Cronulla, calling upon the parliament to delay the implementation of this legislation until they have had more time to consider the impact of the new funding arrangements that are proposed in this bill. I am sure, as I said, senators would have received heaps of correspondence from right around the country indicating concerns about a substantial reduction in funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I might refer to a fax from the national body of the Uniting Church Community Services Australia, which was dated 20 June. They say at the end:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current financial variables as identified to date under the reform strategy clearly indicate major problems with the capacity of the new legislative framework to meet the stated policy objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is crucial the passage of the Bill be delayed until the financial variables have been more thoroughly tested and flaws eliminated.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They also refer to the care subsidy and to the new standard classification as well as to the issue that the Democrats now say has been resolved; that is, the concessional resident subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that is just a microcosm of the amount of concern that is out there in the aged care sector about the impact of this legislation. We
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would submit that we should endeavour, as a matter of good policy and as a matter of ensuring that when this legislation comes into force&mdash;as no doubt it will, because the numbers are here for it to be passed eventually&mdash;we at least give people in the sector some certainty. We should give them an opportunity over the remaining part of this year to more adequately and properly assess the implications and enable them to have all of the information, have the details and have the principles. As we saw yesterday, the government cannot give us information about the committee structures that they envisage being established by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would particularly ask the Democrats, Senator Woodley, to have a look at your recommendations in the report, contained at page 87. Do not do what you did yesterday, which was ignore your own recommendation with respect to the establishment of an independent review committee. We put up an amendment to have that provision inserted into the legislation, and you did not support it, even though your own recommendation was that the legislation be amended so that that committee would be established under the legislation. So I implore you on this occasion to support the opposition's amendment with respect to the operative date of the legislation, and that should be 1 January 1998.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Forshaw has put a lot of matters before the committee which I may not be able to answer completely, but I will certainly do my best. In relation to the last issue, which he keeps raising, I am happy to debate that when we are considering his amendment which deals with that issue. But let me deal with the issue of the date, which is before us at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Senator Forshaw that he and I could read letters from different groups until the cows come home and really not resolve anything. But the problem he has is in catching up. The last letter that he read, from Community Services Australia, was from the group that was involved in the discussions over the weekend and who signed off. So the problem with reading this material is that we need to put it in context.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5300">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He read from a press release from Community Services Australia, which is the Uniting Church peak body. Libby Davies, Harry Herbert and Les McDonald were all involved in the discussions and following that press release were prepared and happy to sign off on the agreement which was reached. That is the problem with standing here and reading from these various bits and pieces of paper. However, I know that I do it, too. I am not giving Senator Forshaw a caning over that; I am just saying that that piece of paper from which he read was out of date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me deal with the substance of this issue because I think it is an important issue. I will deal not only with the points that Senator Forshaw made, which were good points, but also with some points made by Senator Margetts in her speech during the second reading debate which went to this matter. I quote what she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We should be spending more time on these bills. There is an unseemly rush to deal with something of such major importance to all Australians. And I am not the only one who believes this. Yesterday, the Australian Nursing Federation put out a press release entitled `Aged Care Bill 1997&mdash;Democrats let residents and staff down'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She then quoted from that press release as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANF acting federal secretary, Denis Jones, said the break&hyphen;neck speed at which they sought to do a deal with the Government . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I ask Senator Margetts: is this the same Denis Jones who published the most appalling photos of what were apparently, according to him, patients with bed sores, to show what would happen if the bill is passed? The only problem was that Denis Jones did not explain, in publishing the photos, that they were 20 years old. My wife, who was working voluntarily in my office last week, who is a registered nurse and who works in an aged care institution, opened the envelope and I had to get her down off the roof because she was so angry at the misrepresentation of those photos, given her experience in working in aged care. So Senator Margetts ought to be careful about who she takes advice from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will quote further from Senator Margetts's speech because I am a bit angry about it. She went on to quote a little further from the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Nursing Federation's press release. I do not blame the Nursing Federation; I want to pin this on Denis Jones. I think most nurses would dissociate themselves from much of what he has said. She quoted from Denis Jones's press release as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He criticised Senator Woodley for his selective representations to the Government on behalf of church organisations, because they ignored the interests of aged care staff and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do take umbrage at that. I say to Senator Margetts that I have spent 10 months&mdash;in fact, I have spent years, but certainly the last 10 months&mdash;consulting as widely as possible, not just with churches, but with Aged Care Australia, the RSL war veterans homes, the Australian Nursing Home and Extended Care Association, the Council on the Ageing, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, Tricare, the Older Women's Network and the Australian Nursing Federation. I attended the hearings of the nursing home inquiry conducted by the Senate. I did not see Senator Margetts at many of those hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been a director of an aged care institution. I have served on management committees of aged care institutions for years. I have been a chaplain for years to aged care institutions where staff and residents were my major concern. In the last 12 months I have consulted face to face with and visited nursing homes such as the Freemasons Home in Sandgate, the RSL War Veterans Home in Caboolture, Pleasantville in Wynnum, the Shalom Elders Village in Townsville, the Helping Hand Centre in Adelaide, and Ballycara in Scarborough. All the other Democrat senators have done the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have consulted widely. Selective advice&mdash;I think that is a joke. If there is any group in the Senate that takes selective advice from people and makes selective representations, it is certainly the Greens. I normally do not attack people, but I have to say that I was fairly angry about that kind of accusation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have consulted as widely as I possibly could, as have the other Democrat senators. We have received very diverse advice&mdash;sometimes conflicting advice. We have tried to take on board all that has been said to us.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5301"> We have taken account of it. We have not always agreed with every piece of advice that we have received but it is certainly not selective. I believe the advice is as wide as any human being could receive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another issue associated with selective advice&mdash;and I am not accusing Senator Margetts of this, but it is certainly very widespread in this community&mdash;and that is an anti-church attitude which says that if it comes from the churches it must be wrong. I am pretty sick of that attitude. I make no defence of the proposition that the church should have a privileged position in the community. I certainly do not believe that and, in any case, that is excluded by the Australian constitution. But I do believe that the church and Christians have a right to put their point of view along with every other citizen, especially when they have expertise. In this area, they have very much expertise. They have been there from the very beginning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind the Senate that the not for profit church sector has 30 per cent of all aged care residential places, 80 to 85 per cent of hostel beds and 20 to 25 per cent of nursing home beds in Australia. It was very appropriate, along with the other consultations I had, to include those church bodies in the consultations and the agreement I reached with the government. That is especially so when we were discussing disadvantaged people, because they are the ones that the Democrats were most concerned about. We said all along and constantly that it was the concessional residents who were our major concern, and they certainly were the major concern of the church groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is something else that has escaped the Greens and Labor. That is the money for infrastructure which was in the budget and which was put there by the previous government and has now disappeared. I am not happy about that, but being unhappy about it will not bring it back. There is no point supporting amendments to try to return to the previous system under Labor. That system has gone. What the Democrats tried to do was work within the new situation. We have helped to claw back $40 million for infra
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> structure improvement. That is a lot more than was allocated in the last year of the Labor administration. The figure I understand that was allocated for infrastructure upgrading by Labor in the last year of its administration was $10 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are now proposing is $40 million&hyphen;plus for concessional residents, accommodation bonds for those who can afford to pay, plus another $10 million in reserve for regional, remote and disadvantaged areas. I am not an accountant, but it seems to me that those figures add up to a lot more than Labor spent in the last year of its administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware and Labor are aware that they opposed many of the key elements of this reform from the very beginning. Do not only read the dissenting report by the Democrats, but read the report in toto and you will see that there were many key elements of the reform.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We both did, I am sure, because we are both avid readers. You will see there that the Labor Party was never going to support key elements of this reform. Once I understood that, I was aware that it would not matter how much time we took in this debate&mdash;Labor were not going to change their position. In August, in September, in November or at the end of 1998, the position that Labor would take would be the same.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having been able to come to an agreement with the government that answered many of the issues which were being raised by significant groups in the community and having been given written assurances that those concerns would continue to be addressed by the department and the minister, I believed there was no point in further delaying the debate and certainly, as the Greens have said, not delaying the debate to beyond the 1 January 1998 date nominated by Labor. I remind the Senate that what we are debating is government legislation and not Democrat legislation, but we have been prepared to work very hard to improve that legislation. I believe that in the agreement we have been able to make very significant improvements. That is why the Democrats will not support this amendment and would urge the Senate to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5302"> continue the debate and to pass the legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, the government would like to acknowledge the contribution made by Senator Woodley in this matter and his experience in relation to aged care. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS>  The government shares Senator Woodley's concerns in relation to the misleading campaign that has been led by the Australian Nursing Federation and authorised by Mr Denis Jones. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, I draw attention to the fact that those photos that Senator Woodley referred to are misleading. They do nothing to advance the cause in this matter of disseminating information on this proposed legislation. In fact, the reverse is true. The government has engaged in extensive consultation, as I outlined earlier. There is no reason to delay this legislation one day more. The minister has already compromised on the date of 1 October 1997, and it would be a disservice to the people of Australia were the implementation of this bill put off until 1 January next year.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I make some comments in response? At the outset Senator Woodley said that he was happy to debate the issues I raised about the Democrats' foreshadowed amendment in the report which they did not pursue yesterday. Then he went right off the topic of the amendment to deal with some matters raised by Senator Margetts. I took it from Senator Woodley's comments that in no way did he make those allegations about me or the opposition. I certainly acknowledge Senator Woodley's integrity and his work in this area over many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To return to the operative date of the legislation, Senator Woodley referred to the letter from Community Services Australia, the national body for community services in the Uniting Church, which I quoted from. As I said during my earlier remarks, I readily concede that that letter was sent on 20 June, which was prior to the announcement by the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Democrats by way of a press release on 24 June. Senator Woodley was kind enough to inform me that the agreement had been reached. But I do not think that media release answers whether or not you should now backtrack from your earlier position in the report regarding the date of operation. In that report the Democrats stated that the introduction of the bill should be delayed, but that it should be delayed no later than 1 January 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the Democrats were aware&mdash;as indeed were all the participants in the committee when they were finalising the report last week&mdash;that the minister had already indicated an operative date of 1 October. So clearly it was the position of the Democrats to propose a date later than 1 October but no later than 1 January. So the fact that the Democrats have negotiated this deal with the government in the last few days does not in any way detract from expressions of concern right across the aged care sector, from providers and people who are residents or representatives of residents in those establishments to employee organisations and the professions. The fact that that agreement has been reached does not in any way overcome the many concerns that still remain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrat press release put out on 24 June indicates that the Democrats, together with the three main church providers and the government, have agreed to these points specifically: firstly, an increase in the concessional resident subsidy, which I acknowledge was of major concern to the Democrats&mdash;as it was indeed to the Labor Party as we have been saying all along that it should be increased to $12; secondly, that there will be a review of the entire aged care reform package in two years; and, finally, that there will be an independent review of the residential classification scale. Associated with that are the matters raised by Senator Lees with respect to the complaints committees. But, as you know, Senator Woodley, there are lots of other issues that are of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a bit of sophistry to say, `Oh, well, all these groups have been writing to us up until today; they had all these concerns
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5303"> last week but things have moved on and it is an entirely new world today where the agreement has been reached between the Democrats and the government so all the issues have been resolved.' Clearly that is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley, you know as well as I do that you and the Democrats, as expressed in the report, are also concerned about the fact that the principles have not been finalised and about issues such as how the level of daily fees will impact upon people who will be seeking to gain access to nursing homes. One could go on and itemise all those issues, but they are quite adequately covered in the report. But I still put the point that, notwithstanding your agreement on one major issue&mdash;that is, the level of the concessional resident subsidy&mdash;there is still a need for further discussion and for further time to allow the impact of this legislation to be fully understood and assessed out there in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially what we are saying is that the commencement date should be put back by three months, from 1 October to 1 January. That, I believe, is really the position of the providers and of the organisations out there. Solving one issue has not solved all of their concerns. I take you back to the report. I will not read it in full, but I just note that chapter 1 of the report details the various organisations that have been expressed their concern&mdash;Aged Care Australia, the ACTU, the New South Wales Aged Care Alliance, and a range of other groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the committee recommended, the commencement date should be delayed until 1 January 1998. We continue to push for that amendment. We ask the Senate to support the amendment that has been moved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Environment, Sports and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill which, as senators would be aware, is essentially a technical bill which amends 15 acts of parliament to improve the administrative processes of those acts to bring Commonwealth legislation into line with the resolutions of the 16th consultative meeting of contracting parties to the London Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping Wastes and Other Material and also to correct a number of drafting errors. The opposition will support this bill following the government's agreement to amend section 40 dealing with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two aspects of this bill on which I would like to briefly comment. In its original form, the bill sought to amend the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 to remove the Australian Defence Force or the defence force of a foreign country from the application of an offence of waste discharge on the Great Barrier Reef. The opposition opposed this amendment to the act. Had the government not agreed, the opposition would be moving amendments to the bill to remove the resultant inconsistency between defence and commercial vessels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to acknowledge that the reef is a highly sensitive world heritage area that demands strict environmental controls on waste disposals, whether they be from commercial, private or defence vessels. Of course, the Labor Party in government had an out
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> standing record of protecting the world heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef. The government's decision to amend the bill to remove the exception for Defence Force vessels is one that is welcomed by the opposition. I hope it will be welcomed by other senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second aspect of the bill that the opposition would like to draw the chamber's attention to is the amendments to the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992 to increase the period for the minister to make a decision on inclusion or removal of an item from the endangered species list from 30 days to 90 days. I think we all acknowledge in the chamber that the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, is particularly slow in his decision making processes, but does he really need three times as long as other environment ministers have had to make these very important decisions? I think this is a very reasonable question to ask you, Madam Acting Deputy President, and other senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose poor old Senator Hill as the Minister for the Environment has to go and consult with a whole lot of his colleagues who are really running environmental policy in this country, but we do seriously question whether even someone as tardy, as slow to act, as indecisive and as wimpy as Senator Hill really needs three times as long, from 30 days to 90 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in the spirit of generosity for which we are known, and I particularly am known, I would like to say, in conclusion to this outstanding speech on this bill, that after removal of section 40 from the bill dealing with waste disposal&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. The government has now removed this particular section from this bill&mdash;a section to which we also objected&mdash;relating to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. As has been said, it would have exempted Defence Force vessels and aircraft from the existing 38J and would have meant that, basically, they no longer could have been fined. It would no longer have been an offence if they had discharged waste, either intentionally or negligently, onto the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.</PARA></TALK.START>

We were very concerned that it was poised as being likely to go through before the exercises, which many, many people in the community would have thought a travesty.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make my comments to the Financial Laws Amendment Bill as brief as possible. The issue I want to raise is one of ministerial approval of Insurance and Superannuation Commission decisions and the inability for appeal. I understand why these things are being proposed, but I need to put a few points on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Insurance and Superannuation Commission, ISC, monitors the practices of insurance companies with the primary  objective of protecting policyholders and ensuring that there is money to cover their policies in the event they need to be paid out. The ISC operates effectively under heavy confidentiality, since an open admission of a problem under investigation by the ISC or action taken by the ISC would have strong negative impact on the business of the insurance companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ISC has the power to take action to ensure there are sufficient economic resources available to safeguard the interests of policyholders. It takes such action rarely. The usual practice is for the ISC to raise issues with a company and a resolution to be made by agreement. Only where a company refuses to address the problems raised by the ISC does it take the step of issuing decisions to rectify situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem this legislation is designed to address is that once a decision has been made by the Commissioner of the ISC the company can, and in some cases has, gone to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and launched an appeal. The justice system generally allows the ISC decision not to be enforced until after
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5307"> the appeal is judged. The result is that a delay, sometimes a substantial delay, can be imposed on what is a last ditch effort to protect the interests of consumers from bad corporate practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The solution government came up with is to say that no appeal can be launched for five years. As a safeguard, the commissioner will now need ministerial approval for almost any decision. While sympathetic to the need for a solution, I wonder if it could not be done differently. I am uncomfortable with eliminating the right of appeal. I think some application of the precautionary principle might be incorporated where a company could appeal but a stay order could not be issued by the AAT against an ISC decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The precautionary principle effectively reverse the onus in cases where action is being taken by government to protect consumers. It is best seen in cases such as the use of chemicals in various commonly used consumable products where the onus is on a company to prove it is safe, rather than on the government to prove it is not. I think the same principle could be usefully applied to consumer protection supervisory agencies like the ISC without eliminating the right of appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of ministerial approval as a safeguard, I think it has the potential to politicise what could be a non-political process. On that point, the minister can be lobbied to prevent the ISC from making a decision. While it is probably true that in most cases the companies the ISC makes decisions against are small ones treading the margins of legal and ethical practice, I am not reassured by claims that the minister would not want to be seen as irresponsible, particularly given the record of government involvement in bad deals in Victoria and elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not reassured because, in the first place, ISC decisions are not public for valid commercial reasons. In the second place, should the problem be with a major company, the ability to effectively lobby government or a minister may be much greater. In short, this bill creates the potential for politicisation of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what should be a judgment made from the standpoint of a consumer guardian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that this bill does have the support of other parties, so there is little point in calling divisions or putting up amendments. But I do wish to note that we are not happy with the approach. The only reason I am not objecting more strongly is that I believe a company in enough trouble for the ISC to wish to take action will be one where the policyholders are already aware that something is definitely wrong, and should they discover that the ISC had tried to make a decision and had that decision overturned by a minister, there would be a substantial cost to government, one that should give a minister pause.</PARA></SPEECH>

Simply, this bill establishes the wind up procedures for Wool International, through liquidation, and the distribution of equity to wool taxpayers in Wool International.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shortly after the 1996 election, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Anderson, set about the major task of restructuring the wool industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Herron. I know that you are a considerable fan of the speeches that I make in this chamber. I would like to briefly revisit the history of the legislation that is before the chamber at this time. The government announced their proposal in relation to a new activity regime in the 1996-97 budget. It consisted of a six&hyphen;week non-payment penalty for the first breach and a 13&hyphen;week non-payment penalty for the second and subsequent breaches. We made our point clear&mdash;and I might say very effectively&mdash;during the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 in the Senate in December of last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we support tough measures in relation to fraud and compliance, we do not believe that people should be cut off from payments without good reason or for inordinate or indefinite periods of time. We believe that the government's original activity test

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am disappointed that the government is not treating this debate seriously because the government's 1997 budget announced a revised penalty regime that was actually more severe than the offer made by Senator Newman in December, especially for a third or subsequent breach, and the penalty for this in fact reverted from an eight week to a 13 week non&hyphen;payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following that, we had further negotiations, which I must say could have taken place before March of this year and avoided all the toing&hyphen;and&hyphen;froing that we have seen on this matter had the government been reasonable, which of course it is not, as you know. That would have led to this regime being in place before today. The government amended the bill in the House of Representatives to give effect to a much more reasonable penalty regime&mdash;an 18 per cent rate reduction for 26 weeks for the first breach, a 24 per cent rate reduction for 26 weeks for the second breach and an eight week non&hyphen;payment for third and subsequent breaches. We recognise that the government has seen the strength of the arguments that have been mounted by the opposition, and the result will be that there is less need for unemployed people to beg, borrow or steal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also government amendments before us on the bill. We will support these.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats will not be opposing this legislation because we believe the changes made will make for a simpler and, on balance, less harsh system. We believe the penalties are still too harsh, but in most circumstances they will be less harsh than those that were imposed by the previous Labor government. That is an interesting proposition, given Senator Faulkner's speech a moment ago. We will also be supporting the government amendments, which I believe are being put forward with this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill follows the government's previous proposal in this area, which was withdrawn after it appeared clear that it was to be rejected by the Senate back in December last year, just before Christmas. The first thing to say is that this new proposal has some significant improvements over the previous one, and I thank the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) and her office for consulting and taking on board concerns expressed by groups, such as the Welfare Rights Centre, on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Specifically, this bill seeks to implement a system whereby, for a first breach of the social security activity test, an unemployed person will lose the equivalent of approximately 4.7 weeks worth of social security payments. For a second breach, that person will incur a penalty of the equivalent of 6.2 weeks of lost payments, and any subsequent breaches will incur a penalty of eight weeks of lost payments. For the first and second breaches, the penalty is a rate equivalent to 4.7 weeks and 6.2 weeks because these penalties will actually be served as a reduction in the person's rate of payment over a 26&hyphen;week period rather than being a total payment withdrawal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are pleased to see the government introduce this system of rate reductions. It was something that we urged on
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5311"> the previous government but it did not take any notice. We believe the current system, whereby people are having their payments withheld totally for extended periods of time&mdash;a system put in place by the previous Labor government&mdash;is an appalling system.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said this on previous occasions, and I will say it again: people who have their social security payments totally withheld are being thrown into total financial chaos. Many have difficulty maintaining stable accommodation; they cannot keep their cars in good running order; and many struggle simply to meet basic living costs. For these people, the effect of these penalties is totally counterproductive in that it severely impairs their ability to get out to continue looking for work.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. In other words, the penalty that the department is imposing on people for not looking for work is actually making it even harder for those people to fulfil their activity test. If there is something that is counterproductive, that is certainly it. In that regard, the system of payment reductions being put forward in this bill by the current government is a positive step forward. I congratulate the minister's office for recognising the importance of this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the Democrats must again express our opposition to the magnitude of the penalties being proposed. It is important to remind the Senate and the people of Australia that it was the Labor Party which originally devised these overly harsh and punitive measures. Unfortunately, as in many other areas such as tariff reductions and HECS fees, the Labor Party opened the door a little and enabled the current government to drive a truck through and so continue going further down the wrong path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe that the punitive scapegoating approach to welfare policy is very much the wrong path to take both on social and economic grounds. To put the impact of the penalty periods in financial terms, for a single unemployed person who gets the basic rate of $321.50 a fortnight, these penalties equate to fines of $752 for a first breach, $1,086 for a second breach and $1,286 for any subsequent breaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Comparing these fines with the figures provided to the Senate by the Welfare Rights Centre last year on the fines for various summary offences gives us some indication of just how severe these proposed penalties still are. I will give you a couple of comparisons. For traffic offences with low levels of alcohol, the fine is $200 to $400. For traffic offences with high levels of alcohol, the fine is $500 to $800. For common assault, the fine is $200 to $500. For assault causing bodily harm, the fine is $300 to $700. So you can see that, for driving an automobile while you are a drunk, you are fined as little as $200, but for falling foul of one of the Department of Social Security's rules and regulations you are effectively fined $750 for a first offence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For breaking into and entering a person's house and stealing from it, you can receive a community service order. But for a second breach of your social security activity test, you are slugged with a fine of over $1,000. Finally, for assaulting a person and causing them bodily harm, you might incur a fine of $300. But for a third breach of the Department of Social Security rules, you lose nearly $1,300.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am disappointed that penalties of this magnitude are still being inflicted on people
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5312"> who are likely to be amongst the poorest and most disadvantaged. I ask all senators to think long and hard about the effect that these penalties are going to have on people and their families. The extent of these penalties has much more to do with responding to mistaken public perceptions than it has to do with good policy. The minister is allowed to go on talkback radio or <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> to proudly declare how tough this government is on social security recipients, but it will do very little to help people get back into work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again it will be left to the charities and welfare groups to pick up the pieces. The Department of Social Security should be looking to alleviate poverty, not exacerbate it. It seems to me that when you are dealing with people's only source of income&mdash;that is, their ability to feed and clothe themselves and their children&mdash;you need to have some pretty solid backing before you would even consider increasing periods during which those people would lose their income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opportunity to test that evidence came up when the previous Labor government introduced the current system of penalties a couple of years ago. The system was far harsher than that which preceded it and, as such, a comparison of breaching patterns before and after the introduction of these tougher penalties would have shown us the effectiveness or otherwise of the tougher penalties. Unfortunately, as I understand from responses to a number of questions on notice that I have asked, such a comparison is not possible because the data simply is not available. That is a great pity. I would hope that, if this new system is to go through, the department will maintain some fairly detailed records on any changes to compliance behaviour that might occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That information would be very useful to the Senate if, at some stage in the future, the government comes back to us with a proposal to increase those penalties even further. I hope that never happens, but if it does it would be far preferable to have some sort of hard evidence to show in what way these penalties do influence people's behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other sort of information which I think has really been lacking from this debate is
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> information on the human impact of these penalties. We have been arguing over numbers of weeks and rates of reductions and whatever else. But in the end these provisions will have a profound effect on the livelihoods of many people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I would seek from the minister is an understanding that some form of research will be conducted which gives us an indication of just what the human impact is of these penalty periods. It would seem that the impact must be severe, if not devastating, for many people. I wonder if the minister might indicate whether the government would go back and indeed provide some resources for research to be undertaken in this area.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senators Faulkner and Woodley for their comments in this regard and particularly their traversing of the areas of history, particularly those comments of Senator Woodley that pointed out the tension on these issues in the Labor administration in its former term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would draw to Senator Woodley's attention the report on fraud and compliance that was tabled by Senator Newman yesterday, and the important principles that were underlined in that review. Certainly that information is important. I acknowledge the point that Senator Woodley makes with regard to the good and proper research that underpins decision making in this area. We will certainly be very mindful of the comments he has made in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Activity Test Penalty Periods) Bill 1997 introduces a new activity test breach regime into both the Social Security Act 1991 and the Student Youth Assistance Act 1973. The primary features of the new penalty regime are as follows. A first activity test breach within a two&hyphen;year period will attract an 18 per cent rate reduction for 26 weeks. A second activity test breach within a two&hyphen;year period will attract a 24 per cent rate reduction for 26 weeks. A third or subsequent activity test breach will lead to withdrawal of payment for eight weeks.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5313">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Any multiple activity test or administrative breaches and waiting period would be served concurrently, and I stress that. The current penalty arrangements for activity test breaches are too complex. Penalties can vary according to unemployment duration and previous breach history. Unemployed people do not know what penalty might apply to them and even DSS and CES staff have difficulty working them out. For such penalties to act as an effective deterrent to non&hyphen;compliance they need to be known and understood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new approach to activity test penalties has been developed to take full account of the concerns about the current penalty arrangements, and after consultation with community welfare groups. It is an approach that is fair and eliminates the worst and most complex features of the current arrangements while still maintaining a strong deterrence effect for failure to meet reasonable requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although concerns have been raised in the past about the impact of penalties which involve a complete withdrawal of income support on both individuals and groups responsible for providing emergency assistance, it is considered necessary to maintain a non&hyphen;payment penalty for a third or subsequent breach. To allow a further rate reduction in this situation would allow someone to continue to receive unemployment allowances at a reduced rate indefinitely even though they continue to refuse to meet their reasonable and legitimate obligations. Fortunately, current DSS customers rarely have three or more activity test breaches. With the administration of the new penalty periods providing a better understanding of the consequences of not meeting their activity test obligations, it is envisaged that even fewer customers will incur a third or subsequent breach.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community broadcasting plays an invaluable role not just in airing views and ideas seldom heard in the mainstream media, but also in giving access to the production of a broadcast to groups in the community who would not otherwise get the chance to be heard. This is one area in which the Greens were pleased to gain assurances from the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) before agreeing to this legislation being deemed non-controversial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that community radio remains just that&mdash;for the community and by the community. That is the critical factor. We do not want the good work of the community radio sector being diluted by the development of quasi-commercial operations abusing the community licence system. I am pleased that the minister wrote to me this week assuring us that guidelines to ensure community involvement in the production and management of community broadcasting will be adhered to in these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also pleased that it is not just the existing community broadcasting aspirants' stations that will benefit from this legislation. The minister has also assured the Greens that new aspirants that emerge `will be eligible for temporary licences on an equitable basis with existing aspirants'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also given us assurances that the budget funding cuts to ATSIC have not affected broadcasting to remote Aboriginal communities&mdash;one of the really important community broadcasting functions. I would have to say, though, that cuts to ATSIC have meant that, by maintaining these extremely important communication functions, other areas of ATSIC end up being cut. So it is no real advantage to the rest of ATSIC funding programs at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take this opportunity to redress some misconceptions, however, about the importance of community radio, in particular the size of its audience share, gauged by its ratings. This has been a matter of some controversy in Sydney lately. It was even picked up in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS>. But the issue is the same everywhere, including in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5315"> my home state of Western Australia. The radio ratings that are periodically published are at best grossly misleading because they fail to record listenership to community radio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Sydney the surveys for radio ratings consistently show over 10 per cent unaccounted for. This is a staggering figure if you consider that the top rating station in Sydney in the last survey had 13.3 per cent of the listeners while ll.9 per cent of listeners were unaccounted for. So it is not the `don't knows'. There are no `don't knows' here; they are people who were listening and their votes have not been recorded. It is likely that a large proportion of these people are listening to community radio. The figures are collected and published by the commercial broadcast sector whose interest it is not in to reveal the listenership of the non-commercial sector.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would draw to the Senate's attention that this legislation is based on a Labor initiative
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5317"> that was embarked upon to rewrite the income tax legislation through the tax law improvement project in 1994. I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The process</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">This legislation is the second tranche of the complete rewrite of the income tax legislation embarked upon by Labor through the Tax Law Improvement Project (TLIP) in 1994.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Passage through the Senate of the first package of three bills commencing the rewrite occurred on 17 March. This legislation, which also commences on 1 July, has been laying in the Senate since March 26 and is being passed at this late hour to ensure that it is not retrospective.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Labor supports this legislation, and the project underpinning it, as it is essential that the enormously voluminous and complex income tax legislation must be simplified.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hopefully this will both reduce compliance costs for both taxpayers and administrative costs for the Tax Office. In addition, the rewrite will also take the opportunity to improve certainty in some cases where there is currently considerable uncertainty in the operation of the law.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">This whole process is necessary because the old legislation, the 1936 Act, has been amended and expanded so often that it had lost an overall coherent structure.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Because of the sheer enormity of the task the rewrite has to occur in tranches. This partial ongoing rewrite process provides its own challenges as it is not possible to repeal the entirety of the 1936 Act and replace it entirely. Labor does not criticise this process, we understand it was the only realistic option.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">However, because of this process there has been some disquiet in some sections of the industry. There are a variety of opinions&mdash;some believe there should be absolutely no policy changes at all involved in the rewrite, yet some such as Judith Ward from Price Waterhouse are reported (Financial Review 11 October 1996) as arguing that the resources of the Tax Law Improvement Program should be redirected towards a tax reform taskforce. That is change policy first and then rewrite the legislation.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Clearly Labor favours the current process which we instigated. The Assistant Treasurer has the authority to make small, limited changes&mdash;especially to clarify the law. However this process should not be used to significantly alter policy, in a somewhat backdoor manner.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Labor thought that the Government agrees with this policy neutral project, however, this legislation, as introduced, goes beyond the neutral rewrite role.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Bill</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The particular tranche being rewritten in this bill includes assessable and exempt income, deductions, trading stock, depreciation and gifts. The more specialised areas include entertainment expenses and primary productions.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">As with earlier bills, this bill was sent to the JCPA for consideration. The Committee has reported on the legislation, report no 348, with the report tabled in the House on 6 March.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Whilst the Committee generally endorses the neutral rewrite, it expressed concern about the relatively significant policy changes proposed within the bill.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In particular, this concern arises about the proposed alteration of the depreciation provisions concerning hire&hyphen;purchase transactions and the proposed alterations to the trading stock provisions where assets change their character from normal business assets into trading stock and vice versa.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Accordingly, the Government, with Opposition support, amended the bill substantially in the House.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Government has now got agreement from the relevant stakeholders on some of these contentious matters&mdash;such as the trading stock provisions&mdash;and are proposing to further amend the bill to implement the agreed position.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Labor will be supporting this bill and the circulated amendments.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I make the point in closing that the Government should have resolved these issues earlier and dealt with this major bill more expeditiously.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">This would have enabled the tax and accounting professions more than a mere couple of days to be expected to get across the substantial rewrite of the law, involving around 550 pages of legislation, that this bill achieves.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I acknowledge that their continues to be criticism of the Tax Law Improvement Program process from the tax profession. These views are noted by the Opposition, however, we do not think that they warrant the termination of the process&mdash;there is also a substantial body of opinion which supports the rewrite process.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In closing I mention that this legislation is being dealt with as a non&hyphen;controversial bill because some contentious provisions were removed by the Government.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I acknowledge their actions to enable the swift passage of the legislation. Although I'm not sure about the logic of the decision&mdash;because the very same matters are to be debated later today or
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5318"> tonight during the consideration of Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No 1).</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">However, I leave the merits of that argument to the later debate. The Opposition supports the rewrite of the law and I will not detain the Senate further.</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before proceeding, I have a statement to make as Chair of Committees. I draw to the attention of the Senate the government requests for amendments to this bill which have been circulated. These requests reinstate in the bill provisions which were removed from the bill in the House of Representatives as a result of representations made to the government. The explanatory memorandum accompanying the requests makes it clear that they will result in a substantial amount of tax being paid which would not otherwise have been paid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government drafters have drafted the amendments, as requested, in accordance with
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their theory that amendments can be requested in the Senate to a bill which does not impose taxation where the amendments would increase the tax payable. This theory has not in the past been accepted by the Senate. The moving of such requests in the Senate results in a bill which does not impose taxation being turned into a bill which imposes taxation and therefore is in violation of paragraph 1 of section 53 of the constitution which provides that laws imposing taxation should not originate in the Senate. In effect, the provisions contained in these requests are laws imposing taxation and the making of the requests means that they have been originated in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proper course would be for the bill to be taken back to the House of Representatives and the provisions initiated there. No doubt this course is not acceptable to the government because of the further delay which would result in the bill being so treated. If the two Houses agree to the requests, there is no remedy against any violation of section 53, but the Senate should be aware of the situation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens have a great deal of concern about the amendments in this legislation which allow a change in the cross&hyphen;media rules. We have those concerns because there is at present taking place a major review of cross&hyphen;media ownership rules in this country. It is in secret; it is behind closed doors. We do not know what is going on there, but we do know that the intention is to have a real shake&hyphen;out of those cross&hyphen;media ownership rules at the end of the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems illogical, to say the least, that we have changes to the rules&mdash;even if it is argued that those changes are on the margins&mdash;occurring here in this legislation before that review has been completed.

We should not be having serial alterations to it&mdash;`shifting sands', as the current government accused the last government of having in its approach to cross&hyphen;media rules. It should be open, it should be transparent, and it should come after a full public debate; but that cannot be said about the changes here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes involved are specifically to facilitate the O'Reilly group of Australian
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5324"> regional newspapers. They have run foul of the cross&hyphen;media rules because their <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queensland Times</EMPHASIS>, which circulates in the Ipswich region, is in breach of the provision of the rule that a proprietor not have more than half the circulation of a newspaper within an area where that same proprietor has the licence to run a radio station. To get around that, the Australian Broadcasting Authority has given permission for provincial newspapers to artificially circulate papers at no cost outside the area, so that it can say, `More than half our circulation is outside the area', whereas in fact that is not the case as far as the purchase of those newspapers by the public is concerned.</PARA>

Minister, is it a fact that from 1 July 1997, `Black Tuesday', child&hyphen;care fees will rise between $5 and $20 per child as a consequence of your government's funding cuts? How do you reconcile that with the statement contained in your party's policy document prior to the last election that the lack of access to affordable child care was one of the major barriers to many women entering the work force?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me there is only one shot in the opposition's locker at present, and that is child care. We have had questions about that throughout the week. As
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I have pointed out several times, it seems to me that we have an opposition that is more interested in the child&hyphen;care work force than it is in the child&hyphen;care customers, the families and the children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also reminded in some of the questions that have been asked about child&hyphen;care centres that have been closing that we are looking at a situation that has been a very definite result of the previous government's inadequacy in child care which we are trying to address&mdash;a national child&hyphen;care planning policy which will make sure that child&hyphen;care centres are available where families need them and that there is not a plethora of child-care centres with too many places struggling to compete for the declining market or the lack of children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a very real way, parents have not been advantaged by the previous administration. We are putting substantial new measures in place to increase the number of places and to make sure that children and families in regional Australia will at last have access to some child care. Seventy per cent of child&hyphen;care provision in Australia is not provided through the community centres which are currently running this campaign about fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seemed a very sad thing that we had an especially vociferous campaign in Tasmania from some of these child&hyphen;care centres which claimed from late last year for several months that the world was going to fall in and that they were going to have to massively increase their fees. Madam Deputy President, do you know what has happened to those child&hyphen;care centres? Some of them have frightened off the clients&mdash;to the extent that they have now joined the 70 per cent of families who are getting child care outside the community child&hyphen;care sector. That has not done those organisations much good at all. Most of them are remaining viable, but they are having to adjust their management practices so they do not put up their fees massively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents are not stupid. Parents do have alternatives. Parents will vote with their feet when it comes to accessing child care, and organisations who persist in this industrial campaign by trying to put up their fees to a level that the market will not wear will lose
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5325"> their clientele. That is a pity because we believe in high quality, accessible child care for Australian families. The previous government's lack of planning has added to the problems of families now. The campaign being run by the union and their mates in this chamber has added to the insecurity which families feel, and they are looking for child care elsewhere rather than pay the sorts of claims that some of those friends of yours are making.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate. In March 1996 an overwhelming number of Australians voted for a new approach to governing our country that embodied strong leadership, a clear sense of direction and a commitment to keeping promises. Against this background, will the minister please outline to the Senate some of the major achievements of the coalition since the government came to office?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5325" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a long list of the initiatives that this government has taken in keeping all of our key election promises: the family tax initiative, which will assist some two million families; private health insurance incentives, which kick in on 1 July; industrial relations reforms designed to make Australia more internationally competitive; capital gains tax relief for small business; a $1.2 billion Natural Heritage Trust Fund; and an increased tax free threshold for self-funded retirees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other examples of where the government is demonstrating a very clear sense of direction. The policies we are putting in place will significantly reduce unemployment over time; there is a raft of measures to enable small business to realise its potential and there is the vital role of families, small business and young people&mdash;all the initiatives we have announced in recent times; and we are now tackling major environmental problems.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5326">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leadership is a vital element of any successful government and, again in this category, the government has demonstrated very strong leadership in getting the budget back into order&mdash;back into surplus&mdash;something which our opponents have been vigorously opposed to. They are not interested in fiscal responsibility; they are simply prepared to wallow in deficit and debt and see Australia become an international laughing stock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are tackling the tough issues of tax reform. What are we getting from the opposition? Absolutely nothing on the subject. We tackled the guns issue and to date some 427,000 guns have been surrendered. Of course, the Prime Minister is currently demonstrating very strong leadership in advocating Australia's position on greenhouse to the international community. Indeed, one would have noticed in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> a report saying that business yesterday strongly backed the continued tough stance of the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in stark contrast to all that that we look at where Labor are going. If you look at the polls, you will see that Labor are clearly going nowhere at all. But it is worse than that because, as I would have thought even they would have realised by now, if you do not stand for something, you will fall for anything. They are now being castigated by commentators who one would have thought were not traditionally Liberal Party supporters, advocates and patsies. We had Mike Steketee the other day saying that Kim Beazley had overplayed his hand by blocking legislation on the people's convention. But, much worse than that, we had Alan Ramsey talking about Labor's obscene rollover. He starts off by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sooner or later the Labor Party will have to stop making a fool of itself if it expects despairing voters to start taking it seriously again.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is serious stuff. We are nearly halfway through the election cycle. The voters out there are wanting to see what the alternatives are, and what do they get?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at last Sunday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> you will find that the person we thought was supposedly in control of policy formulation, Gareth Evans, is now regarded as simply someone
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who has been overseeing the process. In terms of the draft policy which was made available to Paul Daley&mdash;presumably by the likes of Lindsay Tanner, who will not have a bar of it&mdash;it is now being described by insiders as being very light on for anything at the cutting edge of political debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what the former Senator Evans has achieved&mdash;virtually nothing in 15 months of alternative policy formulation. If one looks at Alan Ramsey's piece just briefly again, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a rousing speech on Friday, Labor Senate leader John Faulkner recounted how working for the dole was simply the government's latest measure to blame and punish the unemployed, listed a long string of proposed Labor amendments . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, Senator Faulkner humiliated himself before the Senate on Monday by announcing he was withdrawing all of Labor's proposed amendments.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It was the same with the cuts to immigration where the opposition made a lot of noise but then, of course, just rolled over. So there is a very stark contrast in terms of leadership, in terms of the sense of direction and in terms of commitment to promises. You lot don't believe in anything; we know that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Synon, the new Senator for Victoria, for this important and good question which really goes very much to the heart of what many Australian families, and particularly taxpayers, are concerned about. It has to be said that this government likes nothing better than to provide tax relief to business and to families. Small business, in particular, is the job generating hub of our economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are unashamedly pro small business. We are very happy that we are able to provide small business with substantial tax relief. From next Tuesday, small business owners will be eligible for CGT rollover relief. The original measure has been bolstered by dropping the like business test&mdash;and this has been welcomed by many people in small business&mdash;and allowing the sale of companies also to qualify. At the cost of $300 million a year, this will promote small business and help create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is also worth noting that, from Tuesday, small business owners will be allowed a CGT exemption on retirement. This will benefit those small business people who provide for their retirement by investing in their businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also helping families. Families have already been able to claim the family tax initiative through the PAYE tax system or social security. Those who have not will be able to claim through their normal tax return from 1 July. The family tax initiative provides benefits to two million Australian families at a cost of $1 billion in a full year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 1 July, low and middle income families who have or take out private health insurance will receive a tax rebate of up to $450 per year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome that question from Senator Conroy. It is pleasing that Senator Conroy has had the guts to put his face up after the appalling comment he made last week. It is nice to see that courage has returned to you, Senator Conroy. I refer of course to the comment you made on the capacity of former Labor members of parliament to get jobs. It is good to see you back on your feet again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, Senator Conroy was not listening to the answer I gave to Senator Synon, who showed the interest that we have in providing sensible tax relief to Australian families. Senator Conroy, in  your question you did not mention that we will be providing tax benefits through the family tax initiative to up to two million Australian families at a cost of $1 billion a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> You also did not mention the tax rebate of up to $450 per year that we are going to give
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5331"> for private health insurance. That will be at a cost to revenue of some $600 million. The reality is that families are going to benefit very substantially, Senator Conroy, from the measures that we have announced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You raised a question in relation to the beneficiary rebate, a question which, I might say, was asked by your leader in the other place and was extremely well answered, I thought. I refer you, Senator Conroy, to the answer that the Treasurer gave to your leader when he posed this question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basic objective of the beneficiary rebate is that a person receiving the full rate of benefit for the full year with no other taxable income should not have to pay any tax. Do you understand that? This objective is still achieved with the revised formula. Under the previous formula, many benefit recipients received more rebate than they needed to offset the tax on their benefits. There is no reason why someone with $1 of benefit should get the beneficiary rebate when someone with a similar income but with no benefit receives no rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you go back and see how that formula works, Senator Conroy, you will see just what a silly question you have posed to this chamber. When you look at the major tax relief that this government is delivering to small business and to Australian families, there is no question that we are the low tax government and you come from a party which was a high tax government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian government's position on the provisional legislature is well&hyphen;known. It was disappointing that Britain and China were not able to agree that Hong Kong's current Legislative Council should serve out its full term and that China thought it necessary to establish a provisional legislature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our concern over that outcome has not changed. The provisional legislature is an interim body. The government expects that elections for a legislative council will be held as soon as possible after the transfer of sovereignty on 1 July 1997, consistent with undertakings by China under the 1984 Sino&hyphen;British Joint Declaration and China's 1990 Basic Law for Hong Kong to provide an elected legislative council for Hong Kong.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that Senator Macdonald is interested in what good things are available for families on `Bright Tuesday'. The Labor Party seems to have no interest in things that will benefit Australia's families. They are simply not interested in looking after families. The lot opposite, of course, are the ones who kicked the Australian family, month after month, for 13 years; they left them with a government debt of $600 million and denied their kids the hope of work. That is how much they cared about Australian families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling calculated that the average Australian family lost $12 a week over the Labor years. So much for their care for Australian families&mdash;$12 a week taken out of the pockets of middle Australia. Not only did things not get better under Labor; families actually went backwards. The Howard government is not about kicking families; we are about helping them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5334">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Macdonald said, 1 July is the day on which these families get greater recognition. In social security, there are many very good measures, such as increased help for carers and the continuation of family service centres. These will be built on by other measures announced in the recent budget, such as the more than minimum family payment for families who have a child going overseas for up to eight weeks, and an increased maternity allowance. These are measures for families which we will see in the coming year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two measures on which I want to focus are the family tax initiative and the private health insurance incentives. Let us be very clear about this: the family tax initiative is a tax cut for families. Labor, as we know, increased all sorts of taxes. We are cutting tax for families. Approximately 800,000 have already received their benefits through social security or their pay packets. For those claiming the family tax initiative through their tax return, 1 July is the day from which they can get their tax cut. One million families will benefit in that way after 1 July. They will get $200 for every child, and for single income families, including sole parents, there is an extra $500 a family. That will be a very great help. All up, two million Australian families will benefit from this family tax initiative which recognises the dedication and hard work involved in raising children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nearly 1,300,000 families will also benefit on 1 July when they receive, for the first time, help to pay for private health insurance&mdash;$450 a family, cutting their insurance bills by up to 20 per cent so that they can have the security and confidence of health cover. This, at the same time, ensures that the resources of the public hospital system are targeted to those in need.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the acting Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the Victorian government's abandonment of its proposal to relocate the Coode Island facility to Point Lillias. Is it not the case that Senator Hill and the entire cabinet were persuaded by Mr Kennett's argument that this relocation was a matter of `urgent national interest'? What has happened to the urgent national interest now? When did Mr Kennett inform you that it had evaporated?

It did that exhaustively through a consultative process. It has now decided that it is going to consider bringing the Coode Island facility up to world's best practice.

Based on the evidence provided by Victoria and the compensation package, the Commonwealth agreed to this proposal. The government is very conscious of its environmental responsibilities, which is why we are providing $11 million for the national wetlands program under the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia.</PARA></ANSWER>

The reason for that is that we believe that we can address it through a process of differentiation. I know that you do not like differentiation, because it appears that you tend to represent the vocal minority or vocal communities from some other parts but not Australia. We are prepared to address this in a way that is not just fair and equitable but will not harm the economic prospects of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The view taken by the European Union is that they do not agree with our differentiation process. Yet they are practising it themselves. There is enormous inconsistency between what the European Union is saying they can do and what they say we cannot do. If we go down the route the Democrats want to go, we would put at risk our major industries in Australia and the jobs that go with them. We are talking about reducing enormously one of our major export industries, the coal industry. One of the good things about coal that comes from this country is that it is relatively clean compared to other coals around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are going to put at risk the energy intensive industries. Are you going to say this to me? We have proposals before us for expansions on the North West Shelf for gas. That gas will go to other countries, particularly in the Asian regions, to replace dirty types of fuels. In the process it is going to emit CO2.

One can understand the coal industry's determination to do whatever they can to stop Australia signing on to binding targets. If we sign on, we will probably have to reduce our use of coal as we increase our use of solar, wind and other sources. We can understand the coal industry working internationally to undermine international efforts because, if internationally we accept targets, the coal industry will probably sell less coal overseas. But if we retrain those coal workers that we are so worried about, bring them up from underground and actually put them into new, clean, green technologies, they will still have jobs. Your modelling does not take into account all the positives that should be there.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Some three months ago this government accepted the advice of the Victorian government that the movement of the Coode Island facility to Point Lillias was a matter of national significance, a matter of national interest. At Coode Island we have a chemical waste dump facility some four kilometres from the central business district of Melbourne. It is surrounded by many tens of thousands of residents throughout the western suburbs of Melbourne. It is a very dangerous facility within half a kilometre of residents of Yarraville in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a facility which, according to the Victorian government only three months ago, as a matter of urgent national interest should be relocated. At the time Senator Hill said, before the estimates committee, that this government would be very embarrassed if the Kennett government actually changed its mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise this question: what was it three months ago that, in the national interest, was forcing the removal of this dangerous facility to Point Lillias but now is no longer forcing this in the national interest? What is it that has changed in those three months? Why was it that this government was so prepared to turn aside from its international obligations under the Ramsar convention to move this stuff as a matter of urgent national interest?

If it was of national interest three months ago, why is it not now still a matter of national interest?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising that this matter is being treated seriously in Victoria. It has been the position of the Victorian government since 1990&mdash;that is, of the Victorian government under Labor.

Why is it not finding out why, suddenly, there has been such an enormous change in attitude in Melbourne?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall the way in which the Victorian government dealt with the casino and the amazing lengths they went to to subvert any possible planning restrictions on the casino in Melbourne. I recall the extraordinary scandals that were involved in building that monstrosity on the banks of the Yarra. When it comes to this facility, look at the extraordinary lengths the Victorian government is prepared to go to to avoid its obligations and to avoid its commitments to ensure that the facility on Coode Island be moved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has a very good record on this issue. It set up the procedures to ensure that relocation occurred and undertook to see that that facility was in fact moved. The Labor Party is committed to the removal of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the facility from Coode Island. They would like to know what the Victorian government is doing with the amounts of money that have been allocated for the relocation of it. I would like to know what has been the relationship between the Victorian government and Terminals Pty Ltd, the company that operates Coode Island. The minister for planning in that state said just a few months ago that it was not safe, that it was not in the national interests that that facility stay where it was. He now says that the facility is safe. What has occurred in three months to make the difference? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ferguson, the reason I raise this is that, as a member of the ERCA estimates committee, in September of last year and in early February of this year I asked a number of questions of the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), who was at the table, about the Point Lillias site. I also asked him what his view was about the habitat for the orange&hyphen;bellied parrot.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to give Senator Hill his due. He gave a very comprehensive answer, knowing all about the orange&hyphen;bellied parrot, its habitat, its other habitats around south&hyphen;eastern Australia, its migratory pattern, et cetera. It was a very erudite answer and I complimented him on it at the estimates hearing at the time. I thought, `This parrot has a chance with this site at Point Lillias. If this minister has taken such an opportunity to learn about this bird, it has a chance.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we found with this minister was that, after knowing all of that, in the end, he crumbled under the pressure to Mr Kennett. He made it quite clear in the end that, if the Victorian government put the weights on him, he was going to roll over and excise about 20 hectares from the site and make it available for the chemical plant to be relocated from Coode Island. He got roundly condemned by us and by other people in the community for having rolled over for Jeff Kennett.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5340">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two days ago, Jeff Kennett rolled over on top of him and did him over. It is just as well for Senator Hill that he is over in New York, not here at the table today or yesterday, because he would have looked like a dope of the first order. What it really says is that Jeff Kennett does not give two hoots about the standing or the credibility of this government and its environment minister. A matter of only a few weeks ago Jeff Kennett and the Victorian government were saying that this was a matter that was in the urgent national interest, that a decision had to be made. That was the view of the Victorian government. What did Senator Hill say about what the situation would be if this decision of the Victorian government were not to proceed? At the estimates hearing on 14 March, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth government has accepted Victoria's argument that there is an urgent national interest to relocate the Coode Island chemical storage facility to Point Lillias.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At estimates hearings on 9 May&mdash;less than two months ago&mdash;he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think we would all be very embarrassed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I wonder whether Senator Hill realises how lucky he is to be out of the country this week so that this embarrassment is not inflicted upon him personally, publicly, right here in Australia. I can assure the Senate that when he returns in the next session of parliament, he will be reminded here and in the estimates committee of his embarrassment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point is that I think this situation really does say something about Jeff Kennett's view of this federal government. He can treat it with contempt; he can put the weights on it. He can break arms to get decisions that he believes at a particular time suit him. When something does not suit him, he can drop the decision and leave a federal minister&mdash;the No. 3 minister of the Liberal Party of Australia, the leader the coalition government in the Senate&mdash;looking awfully embarrassed. I think that is a further interesting point about what Jeff Kennett thinks of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I can say in conclusion is that, as one who raised the question about the habitat of the orange&hyphen;bellied parrot, I do hope the government can now reconsider this matter
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and can put back into the habitat the 20 acres they excised. I think that would be at least a partial recovery, but it will not save this minister from his awful embarrassment.</PARA></SPEECH>

The Friends of Point Lillias did a lot of work. No doubt they came to Senator Kemp's office, and he would have given them some assistance in their attempt to save Point Lillias. The organisers of that particular group, Rosemary Faris and Kathy Barker, did outstanding work in trying to preserve this particular area that had been declared under the Ramsar agreement. Not only were they intent upon doing as much as they could for this area, the Wathaurong Aboriginal Cooperative was also foremost in trying to preserve this area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In case you have not worked it out, this is the federal parliament. The Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, has responsibilities under the Commonwealth laws relating to the environment. What Senator Hill has done has been appropriate and correct and completely in accordance with processes. You would all be aware of the particular facts of the matter.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all instances, the Commonwealth government has been very correct with, and very careful of, the environment&mdash;just as we always are. The Labor Party runs the old line of criticise, criticise. You might recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that that is what it did when the government tried to make the greatest investment ever in our natural heritage. The Labor Party opposed it all the way through. Do you remember? We wanted to sell one-third of Telstra, and the Labor Party did all in its power to stop us. It fought us right to the wire so that we could not get that money to invest in our natural heritage. That is typical of the Labor Party all the way through. Cringe, cringe, cringe, whinge, whinge, whinge, and no constructive comments or suggestions whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a great environmental record.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I want to say that the Democrats did welcome the decision not to go to Point Lillias. However, as my colleagues have pointed out, this government has egg on its face. Indeed, Senator Hill said during estimates, in response to my question about the urgent national interest, that, yes, it would be most embarrassing for this government and no doubt the Victorian government to turn their backs on that decision to excise a very important part of Victoria, a very important Ramsar site in Port Phillip Bay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will have to wear that embarrassment, because some weeks ago I went down to have a look at Coode Island. I examined the fire services that have been installed there. I looked at the way in which, for instance, there is nitrogen drenching into the top of each of the storage tanks to prevent them from exploding in the way the last fire back in 1991 was caused. Altogether, $18 million has been spent on that site. It was very clear to me at the time&mdash;as it should have been very clear to the Commonwealth government also&mdash;that there was no longer the same urgent national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government realised that; it realised it last year at a meeting attended by the Department of Finance, the minister's own department and several others, where concern was expressed about whether or not the Victorian state government had demonstrated an urgent national interest. We received a copy of the minutes of that meeting, and at the time we pointed this out to Senator Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there have been a number of occasions on which the minister has been warned that urgent national interest has not been demonstrated. And, of course, the decision the other day very clearly points this out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government senators have talked about there being no other option, but I would like to put one today&mdash;and that is, that we take a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5343"> really close look at the need for us to store chemicals in the longer term. I think we need to accept that chemicals should not be stored close to where people live&mdash;there is no doubt about that. We need to examine the use of the sorts of chemicals that are stored on a site such as this; and we need to make provision for seeing they do not pose a threat to human health in the future. The way to do that is not only to have a very strict safety regime in place but also to see that we do not keep a combined store of such materials in one place and that we do not have them close to a city. But, of course, we also do not want to destroy very important environmental considerations. For instance, we do not want to see the Ramsar site being destroyed through our moving such a complex there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to conclude my remarks by saying: yes, the minister does have a case to answer. Indeed, he should be embarrassed, because we all know that he knew at the time that there was no urgent national interest; that the work that had been done at Coode Island had satisfied those problems to some degree. I think that leaves us then with the question of why, indeed, the Commonwealth government did go along with the Victorian government's plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we saw recently with a decision over the Essendon airport that the games that are being played here between the federal government and the Victorian state government are those that indicate that neither government cares about getting the real answer&mdash;the answer to the question which will be in everybody's interest. They are more interested in games. They are more interested in the sorts of contradictions, the sort of complicity and the sorts of interparty tricks and games that are being played between those two groups. They are not so interested in the environment, and neither are they so interested in the future of either the industry or, I should say, those people who currently live around the Coode Island complex.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is just one other point I want to make. Coode Island is actually surrounded by heavy industry. It is surrounded by a very large petroleum complex. I think this is an

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on the answer given to the question about the Coode Island facility. It should be of concern to all of us, in terms of the decision making process that has taken place, that in the first instance a significant national interest was found for shifting this facility, and I think rightly so. There was a very significant accident in 1991. As a result, the Victorian government set up a review process. I think they established what was called the Coode Island review panel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Senator Ian Macdonald's information, the review panel I think identified five different sites. Point Lillias was not one of them but they identified five sites. Somehow Jeff Kennett did not seem to care too much about the trumped-up corella, which is what he seems to think the bird is. It is very important, from the point of view of the orange-bellied parrot, that we take all necessary measures to protect every piece of its habitat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As honourable senators probably know, it breeds in the south-west of Tasmania, and there has been a lot of money spent. I think the minister said in answer to a question in estimates that over a very short period of time nearly half a million dollars has been spent in an effort to ensure that this bird can survive. It is registered under the Endangered Species Protection Act. The minister has every responsibility both under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act and the Endangered Species Protection Act to ensure that, if there was a proposal to shift this facility from Coode Island to Point Lillias, there was not going to be any impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What should be of concern to us is the process of decision making. How come it was of significant national interest to shift this facility one day and the next day all that suddenly changed? A lot of money has been spent by both the Victorian government and the Commonwealth government in establishing where this site can be moved to. As Senator Hill rightly identified, the government would be embarrassed if Jeff Kennett turned around and changed his mind. He did, and the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5344"> government ought to be embarrassed. I hope that in future, when you are dealing with these issues, you take more account of the decision making process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recall when we were in government that you used to be very critical of hasty decisions with respect to environmental matters. Indeed, we have a situation where one day there is major significant national interest for the Coode Island facility to be moved and the next day that is not the case. It is not proposed to move it anywhere but to leave it where it is. What happened to the concern, as Senator Carr and Senator Cooney said, for the residents of Melbourne with regard to leaving the facility where it is? What has changed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Allison pointed out that some $18 million has been spent in improving the safety of the facility. It still does not answer the question that, throughout the process, there was this claim of significant national interest to move the facility, whether $18 million was spent on it or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Macdonald said, `Look, this is not a major issue. The government is addressing major issues. The people want us to participate in the process of major issues.' One thing the people of Australia do not want us participating in is some of the major issues that you have brought about&mdash;cuts to child care, work for the dole, cuts to education funding and charges for aged care. That is what the Australian people do not want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We may as well take some time to debate matters that ought to be debated because this government, on the one hand, is taking money off the people of Australia and, on the other hand, wasting it with stupid decision making processes. It is not acceptable. The government ought to be embarrassed, and I assume it is. I am probably right in saying that is why Senator Hill is overseas and not here. He will be back, and estimates will occur again. I am quite sure some interesting questions will be put to the minister at that time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government opposes this motion and will require a division on the matter. I want to just briefly, without taking much of the Senate's time, indicate why that is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A return to order against someone in the Senate is one of the most powerful weapons available to this chamber to scrutinise parliamentary activity. No&hyphen;one, I presume, in this chamber would deny the need for such an opportunity to be there, to have a return to order which says basically&mdash;for those who do not understand that terminology; students in the gallery&mdash;we want all these documents and you will have to provide them. Because it is the most powerful weapon available to the Senate, it is pretty obvious that it was never, ever intended to be used for a cursory examination of whatever is in a government file that may be of interest. That is, in fact, what Senator Kernot wants to do on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps she does not regret not being in government because having no prospect of ever being in government brings with it, of course, a lack of responsibility. You can say and promise whatever you like knowing that you will never be in a position of having to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> deliver it. But every now and again there is this sort of passing lingering thought that maybe it would be nice to be in government and see everything that a government can see. She wishes she was in that position, so she wants senators opposite&mdash;Senator Harradine and Senator Colston&mdash;effectively, to come and support a return to order, one of the most powerful tools available to this chamber, to peruse some correspondence that we have received in support of a measure that she is not in support of. That is what she wants&mdash;to be able to walk in and out of files looking at letters that people have written.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt about this point, Mr Acting Deputy President: this government will always be more accountable than the last one. You may ask, how will we be accountable on the work for the dole scheme? When the schemes are up and running, when they are work for the dole schemes and people are successful in getting on them&mdash;with all the documentation in relation to that&mdash;of course we will have to be accountable. But the government should not have to account to the opposition for the sorts of letters that people write in support of the policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no question of not being accountable for the scheme when it is up and running, much as it will be regrettable to Senator Kernot as she does not want the scheme to be running. No doubt Senator Carr does not want it to be running; he just got bulldozed in his party room and they had to come in here and do a triple 10 backflip and say, `Yes, yes, we support it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Someone might say, `Well why not release the letters anyway?' The first point I make is that this is a matter of interest just to Senator Kernot. There is no national interest in general letters of support for a scheme being released so Senator Kernot can peruse the correspondence files of a minister. There is no national interest there; it is just a passing interest of hers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we know that a group has been formed to oppose the work for the dole scheme, which is determined to discourage participants from taking part. Despite the fact that the parliament has voted to endorse this scheme, there are people who are grouping
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5346"> together and saying, `We want to make sure that this does not go ahead.' Senator Kernot believes that by whiting out names and addresses these people will be protected, but that is not always the case. Just because a name and address is not there does not mean that it is impossible to locate someone. From the nature of some letters you would be able to see that it would not necessarily be that difficult to perhaps identify some people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So if this motion is passed, regrettably, we will have to look very carefully at each letter. It will be very time consuming. I would ask Senator Kernot to consider whether she is prepared to re&hyphen;amend her motion and change the time. This is wanted by midday tomorrow. The Democrats would like something, so we have to stick on a whole lot of extra public servants and get them to do this work, on overtime, because Senator Kernot would like this by midday tomorrow. Perhaps, Senator Kernot, you would be prepared to amend it to, say, 5 o'clock tomorrow? That would be at least of some assistance, if it is to be passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by making the point that this is one of the strongest weapons available to a parliament, and since we have been in government it has been used and used and used to the point that its currency has been devalued. You have devalued the currency of one of the most powerful weapons available to parliament. In doing so I believe you continue to diminish the power of parliament and invite this government and future governments to give as little as possible, which is, I think, a very unsatisfactory situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I equally conclude by repeating that this government will be accountable to parliament, but I we think we should be accountable for the government's programs, not for public expressions of interest in the government's programs. That is not something that we ought to be accountable to parliament for. Everybody who writes to a parliamentarian does not necessarily expect their letter to be made public. The expressions of interest to us are not a matter of public interest.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments seek to amend the objects of the act as set out in clause 2 and, in particular, they seek to amend the objects clause of the bill to spell out what it is that the bill is designed to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard a lot of comment from the government for some time now about the objectives that they have for their so&hyphen;called reform package for aged care. It is striking, therefore, that some of the important aspects that they claim will be advanced by this legislation and the principles that underpin
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this legislation are not appropriately reflected in the objects clause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key issues that has surrounded the debate on this legislation has been the question as to whether or not we will in the future have a situation where access to aged care, particularly in nursing homes, will be a right, as it has been for all time, or whether it will be determined on the basis of the means, the income, the assets, of individuals. It is the opposition's firm view that, once the act is in operation, it will not take too long before the views that we have expressed about it will be shown to be true; that is, that in the future access to aged care will depend more upon your ability to pay and what assets you have and less upon the needs of the individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, I believe it is a fundamental tenet of our society that it has prided itself on ensuring that all people in this country have access to adequate health care. Labor governments have in the past had to restore access to adequate health care after the destructive periods of Liberal governments which, for instance, have in the past dismantled Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But access to adequate health care should be a right for all Australians, and particularly should continue to be a right for Australians in their latter years. That is why it is important that all persons who need access to nursing homes have a right to such care. They should not have to worry about, for instance, whether or not they have sufficient assets to buy their way in. We will come to talk about those issues in more detail later, particularly when we deal with the issue of the accommodation bond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments, therefore, substitute firstly a new paragraph (a) in the objects clause, so that funding for aged care will ensure that care is of a high quality, is of an appropriate type and level, and is available irrespective of a person's capacity to pay. As noted in paragraph (iii) of clause 2&hyphen;1 in the bill, the current objects of the act are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the need to ensure access to care that is affordable by, and appropriate to the needs of, people who require it;
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5349">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The inclusion of the words `that is affordable by' demonstrates the real purpose and intent of this legislation. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Whilst the rest of the objects may refer to such things as the needs of people&mdash;and that is highly appropriate, of course&mdash;and refer to the promotion of high quality care and accommodation, the protection of health and wellbeing, the thing that really stands out in the objects clause are those words `the need to ensure access to care that is affordable by people who require it'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once you read that part of the objects clause, everything else pales into the background, because that is what drives this entire legislation. This is seen in other aspects, such as the fact that, unless you can qualify as a concessional resident&mdash;and those provisions are limited to a narrow group of people with very few, if any, assets&mdash;then you are going to have to face the prospect, if you wish to get into a nursing home, of finding large amounts of funds, estimated up to $80,000 or $100,000, to be sure of getting a bed in a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Access to aged care under this legislation will depend on people's wealth, not simply and only on their health. As I have said before and as people from right across the industry sector have said, people do not choose to go into nursing homes in the way that they may choose to sell their home and move to a smaller home unit, or sell their home or their unit and move into shared accommodation, move into hostel accommodation. They are decisions that people themselves can make when they have the time to consider the options and the needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, when people make decisions to go into hostel accommodation, they have in mind that it will make their life easier in terms of not having to cope with all of the demands that they may have had when they owned their own home and so on; that there is certain assistance available in such accommodation. But they are all choices that people can make, and they can have regard to their circumstances when they do so. But that is not the situation when it comes to nursing homes. Therefore, we believe that it is entirely inappropriate to have a system whereby up&hyphen;front in bold letters is that statement that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> access to care under this legislation is on the basis of your wealth, of whether you can afford it or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a requirement in subclause (2) of the objects clause which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In construing the objects, due regard must be had to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the limited resources available to support services and programs <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> under this act;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So once again we have the concept of `affordability and limited resources available to support services and programs under this act' overriding this legislation. That is what drives this government in its move towards a market based `if you've got the wealth, you can afford it' approach. It is only after those principles that underpin this legislation are highlighted in the objects clause that you then actually find references to such things as needs of people who require it or the need to consider equity and merit in accessing those resources. Those needs, the principle of equity, should not be subject to some overriding concept of affordability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also seek to amend the objects clause, as I have outlined and is detailed in the amendments circulated, because there is no evidence of a fundamental commitment to ensuring access to high quality appropriate care for everyone who needs it, irrespective of their capacity to pay for that care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendments make that commitment explicit in this part of the bill. It makes it explicit in the very part of the bill where it should be; that is, up&hyphen;front in the objects clause. I can recall in earlier debates dealing with the industrial relations legislation, and I am sure my friend and colleague Senator Cooney recalls this. We had some discussion about objects clauses in that legislation. When we drew attention to the fact that certain matters that should have been contained in the legislation were not provided for in the body of the legislation, we were often told, `Oh, yes, but if you have a look at the objects clause, that is where it is. So, if it is in the objects clause, you really should not be too worried about the rest of the legislation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have the reverse situation. It is a matter of concern that these principles that we say should be reflected in the objects clause
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5350"> are not contained therein. By supporting our amendments, it will actually bolster those other aspects of the objects that we do certainly agree with. For instance, the object of paragraph (h) is `to help those recipients'&mdash;that is, recipients of aged care&mdash;`to enjoy the same rights as all other people in Australia'. That is precisely what our amendments will do. They will ensure that recipients of health care will enjoy the same rights as all other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendments ensure that the objects clause will reflect a commitment towards providing aged care based upon need, not simply on affordability or capacity to pay. We would ask that the Senate support the amendments that have been moved.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the opposition is right in this, and Senator Forshaw is correct. If you look at the objects clause 2&hyphen;1(1)(d), that is, as it reads, an imperative. It is an obligation that is cast on people under this act; that is, `to ensure that aged services are targeted towards the people with the greatest needs for those services'. Others are recommendatory. If you look, for example, at 2&hyphen;1(1)(g), it is `to encourage diverse, flexible and responsive aged care services'. But I think everybody would agree with (d); that is, that the services ought to go to those most in need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at subsection (2) of 2&hyphen;1, that qualifies it by saying, `Oh, well, the limited resources must be taken into account.' People can understand that there ought to be limited resources, but it seems to me to be contradictory to say that those most in need are going to be the target of the provisions of this act and then create a situation where it is those with resources, those with the most money, who, in fact, are going to get the best services. That is brought out, as Senator Forshaw says, by 2&hyphen;1(1)(a), which says `to provide for
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5351"> funding of aged care that takes account of' these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be too easy for people who have the duty to carry out the provisions of this act to say that 2&hyphen;1(1)(d) is impossible to do anything about because of 2&hyphen;1(2)(a)&mdash;that is, the limited resources that are available&mdash;and that the issue of quality is only a matter that has to be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is going to happen is that those without money are going to be put off into places that do not have the same sort of quality that other places do.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some other comments and pick up the points which were made by Senator Cooney. If you look at the amendments which we have proposed, and the bill as it is currently drafted, you will see that we are strengthening it by referring to objects of the act as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that ensures that the care provided:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> results in appropriate outcomes for the people receiving the care.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Cooney is quite right when he says that the objects are to ensure that something happens; it is a lot stronger than simply saying, as the bill states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objects of this Act are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to provide for funding of aged care that takes account of . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A range of criteria are then listed. It is clearly a weakening of the very commitment that the government says that it has, and that we all should have. Let us face it: we should have a commitment to providing high quality care to the aged. What sort of a society are we if
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we do not have that commitment? We should have a commitment to providing access to care on the basis of need, not on the basis of affordability, wealth or capacity to pay. If people are in need of hospital care, they should be entitled to get it. Equally, if they are in need of nursing home care, then they also should be entitled to get it. It should not be something that comes from legislation that says we will `take account' of those needs or those rights. The legislation should say that we will ensure that those rights are delivered. I think Senator Woodley is wrong. The amendments clearly strengthen the objects of the act by ensuring that these commitments will be delivered and will be available, rather than simply taken account of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect of the amendments, particularly amendment No. 4, relates to a redrafting of the current (1) (v). Rather than take account of the `accountability of the providers of the care for the funding and for the outcomes for recipients', we are saying that the objects of the legislation should ensure `that providers of care are accountable for the funding they receive and for the outcomes of the people who receive aged care services'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I strongly suggest that it is important that the objects of the act should be ensuring that that accountability exists. We should not be just taking account of it because, as Senator Woodley knows, there are provisions in this legislation which change dramatically the future structure of financing of nursing homes in respect of capital infrastructure and that, of course, is particularly in relation to the system of accommodation bonds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that the legislation ensures that those providers of care who are going to be negotiating with residents, or potential residents, of nursing homes about how much bond needs to be put up, who are going to be entrusted with those people's significant sums of money, be accountable, and the legislation must ensure that they are accountable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already expressed our concern, and I am sure the Democrats agree with our concern&mdash;indeed, they have indicated it themselves&mdash;that, as yet, we still do not have the prudential arrangements that will apply to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5352"> providers of care with respect to the funds that they will raise through accommodation bonds. We stress that these amendments should be passed and go into the legislation, because it will strengthen the commitment that we are told is there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very surprised that neither the government nor the Democrats can agree with the proposals. They add to the legislation; they do not in any way detract from the legislation. They do not in any way contradict the express commitments that the minister and the government have made about what this legislation is going to do. But if the reason you do not support the amendments is that they are contrary to what you are telling the parliament, and what you are telling the aged care sector and the community, then you should at least come clean and tell the parliament today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, I ask: why can't you agree with an object of the act that will ensure that the care which is provided is of a high quality? Why can't you agree that the care that is provided is of a type and level appropriate to the needs of the people? Why can't you agree, particularly, with an object of the act which would provide that care is available to people who require care, irrespective of their capacity to pay for that care?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that you cannot agree with that amendment sends a very clear signal to people out there in the community that you know that the system is not going to work along the lines you said it would. We know and the community knows that, notwithstanding your assurances, for instance, on the issue of whether or not people will have to sell their homes, people are going to be forced to sell their homes because they will have no other choice in order to raise the bond money to be able to negotiate a bed in a nursing home. That is what is going to happen. No amount of assurances and commitments from the government is going to alter that fact. If we are wrong and if you believe that it will not occur, then put it up&hyphen;front in the objects clause&mdash;agree to the amendment and put in an objects clause that says that aged care will be available to all aged Australians irrespective
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of their capacity to pay and it will not be based simply on affordability.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what is known in the industrial relations arena&mdash;an area I have become rather familiar with over many years&mdash;as an opting out clause. This is a whopper of an opting out clause. This is the biggest opting out clause you have ever seen. We have a bill, a bill for an act, that is made up of 400&hyphen;odd pages. We have 300 pages of draft aged care principles&mdash;and what you cannot find in the act, you hope to God you can find in the principles. There is other legislation, prudential arrangements and guidelines and so on to come. Yet we have in this bill a proposal whereby the minister can enter into an agreement with a state government or a territory government to abandon its involvement in the provision of aged care. That is a disgraceful proposition to even entertain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly we support, and have always supported, the position that the Commonwealth should be involved in negotiations with the states in entering into arrangements with the states and territories to improve the delivery of, and access to, aged care services and to ensure efficiency, because this is a national issue. Many aged people in this country have access to the pension system after they retire and they may have access to a range of other social welfare or social security measures or entitlements. `Entitlements' is a better word because that is what aged people are entitled to in recognition of their role in our society, entitlements that they should get, having made a tremendous contribution through their working years to the development of this country. That extends beyond state or territory borders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet in this legislation, which is intended to reform aged care and, as this government continues to tell us, lead to a new era of improved facilities, better access to nursing homes and so on, we have a provision whereby the Commonwealth government can enter into an agreement with a state minister&mdash;maybe Jeff Kennett, Premier of Victoria&mdash;whereby the Commonwealth can just walk away from that state and say, `You look after
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it all.' There is no requirement for any of the standards that will be set and obligations that will be required under this legislation in all states to necessarily continue to apply in that state. These agreements can contain anything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, the Commonwealth could enter into an agreement with Victoria, just to pick one state, whereby the prudential arrangements in relation to accommodation bonds do not apply in that state. That is possible. You might stand up and say, `It won't occur,' but under this legislation it can occur. Given the attitude of the Victorian government in respect of a range of other issues where they have been very keen to wipe out rights and entitlements for people in that state, anything is possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years the Labor government has recognised the need for the Commonwealth to take a greater role in this area, just as it had to do in a range of other areas because of the disparities in important services across the states&mdash;whether it be education, health, hospitals, dementia care, and so on. Let us not go back to that time in the past when we had major disparities between one state and another because the states were left with sole responsibility, or most of the  responsibility, in the aged care sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has a strong desire to divest itself of responsibility in a range of areas and return those responsibilities to the states. Let us be frank. Senator Ellison, you know and I know that many people on your side do not like specific purpose payments to the states. I heard those arguments time and time again when I was a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. You do not like the fact that the states have to comply with ensuring equitable provision of services across the country. We are seeing this divesting of responsibility back to the states in so many areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If these clauses remain in the bill then there certainly will be an opportunity for responsibility for aged care to be handed back to the states and territories on a whim or by a simple decision of the minister. This parliament can be by-passed in that process. I urge you to not let us go back to that previous era when aged care was of very poor quality,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5354"> when we had different fees and standards across the country. It is quite contrary to the very things you say that you are trying to achieve in this legislation through, for instance, the provisions that will be enacted in respect of setting daily fees and the amount for the concessional resident subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has just finalised a deal with the Democrats and settled on a subsidy figure of $7 per resident in homes with up to 40 per cent of concessional residents and then $12 per resident in homes with more than 40 per cent of concessional residents. That is the position that the minister has announced. That is what we are told will apply right across the country. Yet under this clause it would be possible to have an agreement with another state for a different regime to apply in that state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the Senate, and I particularly look to the Democrats, to support this amendment. It is vital that this parliament has a say and continues to have a say in the delivery of aged care throughout the nation. We must remove this provision in the bill to take away the unfettered capacity of the government to enter into agreements with states and territories which would override the provisions of this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

Over the past 12 months, the federal government has raised the possibility of devolving the responsibility for a number of health and community care related services to the states. This proposal was one of the main areas of discussion at the COAG meeting in June 1996. At that time the government said that aged care would be one of the first areas to be handed over to the states if the proposals went ahead. Although, at least to some extent, the devolution of aged care seems to have fallen off the agenda for now, thanks to the states' and territories' strong opposition to devolution, I think this is an important amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present the responsibility for health and community based services is shared jointly by
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Commonwealth and state governments, with the Commonwealth being responsible for directly administering funding for nursing homes and hostels. The Democrats, along with almost all the organisations involved in the provision of aged care, do not support the devolution of aged care to the states&mdash;certainly not at this time. Much of the progress in aged care which has been made over the last decade has largely been the result of strong Commonwealth intervention and the establishment of enforceable national programs and national standards. The devolution of aged care services to the states would lead to a variation in services and standards across the jurisdictions and result in a lower standard of care for Australia's elderly, and that is why the Democrats will support the opposition amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a remarkable provision, as Senator Forshaw and Senator Woodley have said. Division 4 means that the proposed act can be reduced to 4&hyphen;1, 4&hyphen;2, 4&hyphen;3 and 4&hyphen;4. You could even leave 4&hyphen;4 out, and perhaps 4&hyphen;1. You could have, as Senator Forshaw says, an act written by a minister, who may not even be in cabinet, and by the territories. Parliament would have absolutely no power over it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot quite follow. Section 4&hyphen;2 talks about an agreement which is `an agreement with a State or Territory under which this Act, or specified provisions of this Act' cease to apply, or that the act itself ceases to apply. So the whole act can be put aside by a particular state or territory. Then the bill says in 4&hyphen;3(1):</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">But the only agreement referred to in 4&hyphen;2 is an agreement to set aside the act or part of the act. I cannot see that there would be any monetary obligation in an agreement to set aside an act or to set aside part of the act. If you made an agreement that said, `We are going to run nursing homes in a particular way and there will be certain obligations to do that,' I can understand that. But the agreement that the proposed act refers to in 4&hyphen;2
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5355"> does not seem in any way to involve money. I can understand that you would have an agreement to set aside part of the act and that the Commonwealth would give money to the particular state to carry out the part of its obligations under the act or that part of the act that was left.

There may be some expenditure in relation to the application of the act and how it operates in a state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These provisions came about as a result of the Council of Australian Governments indicating that aged care was an area that was open to discussion to develop new approaches and explore appropriate responsibilities to achieve the best outcomes in public health. Those responsibilities may well be covered in an agreement in 4&hyphen;2, and those responsibilities could well involve some cost, and hence the question in 4&hyphen;3 in relation to grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is opposed to these amendments for the reasons I have mentioned in relation to the Council of Australian Governments. We look at this as being a partnership between the Commonwealth and the states. The states do have a role to play in aged care, and these provisions would facilitate that partnership.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(aa)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the care recipient has been or is likely to be classified as requiring a *high level of residential care;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment proposes to insert a new paragraph in clause 44-22. The effect of the amendment is to insert a new paragraph which sets the amount by which a subsidy can be reduced by a person's income to zero if the person requires a high level of residential care, that is, classification levels 1, 2, 3 or 4.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for this amendment is that currently there are provisions in clause 44-22 whereby the daily income tested reduction in respect of the care recipient is taken to be zero, where one or more of the following applies: that the care recipient was provided with respite care; a determination was in force under subsection (2) in relation to the care recipient; or the care recipient was included in a class of people specified in the residential care subsidy principles. As I have said, this amendment includes provision also to include persons requiring a high level of residential care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the legislation, a new daily fee is being introduced for nursing home residents who have private income above the pension income free area&mdash;currently $49 a week and $50 a week from 1 July. For each $1 above the income free area, the resident will be required to pay 25c&mdash;that is, 25 per cent of any income or 25c in the dollar for any income over that income free area. They will be paying that on top of paying the standard resident contribution of $26.40 a day towards their care, or on top of the approximately $21 a day if the resident is a pensioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The maximum daily fee that can be charged is $60. This new fee that is being introduced will mean that the effective marginal tax rate for part&hyphen;pensioners will be close to 100 per cent. Part&hyphen;pensioners or self&hyphen;funded retirees in nursing homes are going to be hit in the neck by this legislation. Under the proposed legislation, they will have their incomes assessed by the Department of Social Security for the first time. If you do not agree to that assess
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5356"> ment being made, you will be charged the maximum daily fee. What we are going to end up with is nursing homes becoming, effectively, tax collectors for the government. The equivalent of the revenue raised by this new fee will be deducted from the subsidy paid to the nursing home by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendment will prevent the government from charging the new daily fee for aged care residents who require a high level of care&mdash;that is, those residents of nursing homes. Aged care providers will therefore not then be able to select residents of the basis of their capacity to pay for care. As is the existing situation, current providers of hostel care will continue to be able to charge the daily fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the amendment is as I have just outlined. It will include the category of people for whom the daily income tested reduction is taken to be zero. As well it will include that group of persons who are in need of a higher level of residential care. We believe that it is appropriate that they should be treated in this way and that they should not suffer the significant impost that would otherwise be imposed on them by virtue of the new daily fees that will be introduced.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government opposes this amendment. The government believes that the opposition is trying to maintain a totally separate system between nursing homes and hostels here. It maintains that this would be unworkable in practice. One older person might be income tested and another not whilst both being in the same room. The amendment would mean that the aged care system would be unsustainable into the future as the growth in the aged population becomes significant with more and more people require higher levels of residential care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might point out that residential care charges are not a tax. People in residential care pay for their living expenses, just like people in the community. If you accept the erroneous proposition that nursing home residents' living expenses are a tax, then you
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> arrive at the high effective marginal tax rates that are mentioned. You would get the same result if you added rent or mortgage payments or food bills to calculate the marginal tax rates of people in the community. The fact is that people spend most of their income on living expenses, and their spending generally increases as their income rises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the government would say that we have ensured that residents who are able to do so have an incentive to invest wisely and increase their income, because the higher the income, the more they will keep after paying charges. It is as simple as that. The government opposes this amendment for the reasons I have outlined.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary this: does the government have any particular concern about the severity of impact of these charges on those people who are referred to as part&hyphen;pensioner recipients? Of course, for those who are pensioners there is a much lower limit. I suppose that, once you get above the part&hyphen;pensioner level, your income may be substantially higher. But in that category between total pensioner and those who have income that puts them well outside of the part pension, there is a group of people who seem to be dealt with particularly harshly in that they really can be only earning a very small amount above the pension but still have to pay that $60 charge.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments relate to accommodation bonds, which is the new system that the legislation introduces with respect to access to nursing homes. The amendments vary clause 57 by inserting in the box paragraph the words `who can be charged an accommodation bond'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 19 would insert a new paragraph into clause 57-2 to state `an accommodation bond cannot be charged for the entry of a person to a residential care service as a care recipient if the care recipient has been or is likely to be classified as requiring a high level of residential care'. I note that the following amendment that we will come to&mdash;amendment 20&mdash;also relates to the use to which accommodation bonds can be put. In the course of my remarks to amendments 18 and 19, I may refer to some issues that relate to that amendment also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to deal with this whole issue of the introduction of accommodation bonds for persons needing access to nursing homes. In the future, under this legislation an accommodation bond will be required by all future residents of aged care facilities unless they fall into a fairly narrow group. The first is if they are concessional residents. These are essentially people on a low income or with very few assets and who quite clearly cannot find the finances to pay an accommodation bond even of the lowest amount potentially possible under this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, you will not be required to pay an accommodation bond if you are a full pensioner and have not owned your own home in the last two years. If you do own your own home but you still have a spouse, dependent child, or carer living in that home&mdash;and that person would obviously need to continue to live in the home&mdash;then you would not be required to pay an accommodation bond, particularly if the carer, who has cared for you for at least five years, still lives in the home.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has said, firstly, that what it is doing is extending the system that operates with hostel care to nursing homes. I have already put on the record what our position is on that: we do not agree that that is an appropriate approach. We believe the distinction should remain because there is a fundamental distinction between persons who choose to go into hostel accommodation and people who are forced by necessity to go into a nursing home. That is a distinction that should continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also noted in speeches during the second reading debate that whilst Professor Gregory, in his report, recognised the need for substantial capital injection into the nursing home sector, nevertheless he rejected the system of accommodation bonds for nursing home access, particularly because of the significant impact that it would have on the financial position of such persons. I have earlier read Professor Gregory's comments from his report onto the record because that gives the lie to the arguments put by the government that they are relying on Professor Gregory's recommendations in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have now for the first time is a proposal whereby the family home will be included in an assets test if you wish to get into a nursing home. As I said, there are a few exceptions to that situation. I note that, notwithstanding the supposed expertise in this area that the government claims on its side of the chamber, we have not had one speaker from the government, other than the parliamentary secretary at the table, come into this chamber during this debate and seek to support this legislation and defend it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators from the government took an active role in the committee proceedings which led to this excellent report of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee on funding for aged care institutions. They wrote a dissenting report in which they sought to ridicule the views of the majority. They sought to dismiss the views expressed by many witnesses. They alleged that we were engaged in scaremongering and fear tactics&mdash;the usual line that is trotted out. I do not think they ever accused us all of being former trade union officials but I am sure they
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5359"> thought it, which is their usual line. They dismissed out of hand the majority report, but they are not prepared to come into this chamber and speak in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding all those assurances and those comments by government senators, as I have said before and I will say it again, there is no doubt that people are going to be forced into a position of selling their own home. If they do not fit into the category whereby the family home would be exempted from the assets test, if they cannot get access to a nursing home, say as a concessional resident, then the fact of the matter is they are going to have to come up with the money to pay the bond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not forget that it is not just the aged person in need of nursing home accommodation who is involved here, it is family members as well. In just about all cases these decisions are hard for people to make. You have people who have been living in their own home for many years, seen their families grow up in their home and move away and have families of their own, and the grandkids come back. Then the time comes around where one of the parents or the sole remaining parent has to go into a nursing home because of their condition. That is a really difficult time for all concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then imposed over the top of all that is this requirement that they have to work out their asset position or that of a family member if that person happens to be suffering from dementia or some similar illness, and ask: how do I come up with the $80,000 that the nursing home wants in order to get myself or my family member into a nursing home? In many cases there is only one way that they could come up with that money; that is, sell the only remaining asset that they have&mdash;their home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the government to turn around and say, `You will not be forced to sell your home to get access,' has to be the most pedantic argument that could ever be put. The fact that the legislation does not say, `You will be required to sell your home in order to get the amount of bond that you have been able to negotiate'&mdash;it is more likely that you have been told what you have to come up with&mdash;
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">does not mean that people will not be forced to do it. It is a bit like saying that nobody is forced to eat. People are not forced to eat. But if you do not eat, then you do not survive. So, in reality, you are forced to eat, and similarly here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the only way you can come up with the money to put up the bond is to sell your home, then that is what you are going to have to do. That is going to be a situation facing many people across the community from now&mdash;if not from 1 October&mdash;as they look at their future situation and at how they can get access to a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are already enough pressures and stresses on individuals without putting this extra stress or pressure on them. Equally, it is no answer to say, `In lieu of selling your home, you can rent it out and earn income and then pay off the bond periodically.' If that means that you are not forced to sell your home, then that is really begging the question as well. It is clear that many people&mdash;particularly those who have assets that just get them over the limit or, say, self-funded retirees or part pensioners with a small amount of income that still gets them over that threshold figure&mdash;could well find themselves worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure the government has seen the examples that have been calculated of where people rent out their home. By the time you take into account the extra income they receive from that, the impact that that has upon the pension they receive&mdash;because it reduces&mdash;the fact that they have to pay the additional daily fees of 25c in the dollar and the fact that they have to pay interest because they are paying the bond off periodically rather than as an up-front lump sum, those people end up worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They get caught in a bind: they do not want to sell their home, but, equally, how are they going to get some income through either renting or taking out a loan? Who is going to lend them the money anyway to get a bed in a nursing home?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many issues that arise out of this. I have only touched upon one aspect of it so far. I know my colleagues have some further comments to make. I will leave my remarks
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5360"> at this stage at the moment, but I will be coming back to it in due course.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The accommodation bond is certainly at the cutting edge of this particular piece of legislation. It is far and away the most contentious and the most concerning item of this particular bill. The concerns that are surfacing in the community about the accommodation bond&mdash;or the entry fee; whichever way you wish to describe it&mdash;have not really been satisfied to date. In particular, a lot of the concerns about the prudential arrangements for the accommodation bond have not been satisfied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, there is real concern in the community about the principles that have been circulated. I have only recently got a copy&mdash;as I understand it, they were finalised only last week. It seems to me that it is rather difficult for the government to proceed with a bill which is so much reliant on these principles in a situation where they are not yet satisfied. In particular, there are some concerns about the accommodation bond that the Parliamentary Secretary could possibly answer. It may well be that they have given due consideration to it, but it certainly does not seem to me that it has been completely dealt with as yet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first concern that I have is this requirement that you must pay an accommodation bond if you have owned a home in the last two years. Initially, I can see why that has been brought in. If you do agree that an entry
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fee should be charged, of course you want to ensure that people do not try to avoid that requirement. You might, in fact, be concerned that people may fraudulently try to avoid it. Circumstances might exist, Parliamentary Secretary, where someone who owned a home in the last two years has lost it through fraud or because a spouse was severely ill and they had very high medical expenses and had to sell their house or because of an accident&mdash;it burned down&mdash;or some other problem existed and they genuinely had to divest themselves of a home in the last two years. If there is a situation where those people genuinely become very ill and very frail and are required to enter a nursing home, how does this bill deal with that situation?</PARA></SPEECH>

In my view, it would be financial hardship if someone whose sole asset was a house had to pay an accommodation bond of, possibly, up to $110,000&mdash;as we have heard from some providers of nursing homes. Obviously, if that was the interpretation of hardship then nearly every person would not have to pay an accommodation bond.

If you have a home worth a million dollars, then surely that would be something you would want to take into account.

That is, they have to be left with $22,500 for a single and $45,000 for a couple. So you have that set out there as criteria.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If an aged person is assessed as needing nursing home care and accommodation, particularly if they are suffering from some serious complaint, it may well be in those circumstances&mdash;whereas previously they may have been able to get access to a nursing home bed and still receive the medical treatment and care&mdash;that in the future the option of utilising the public hospital system would come more into play. I think that is something that everyone has acknowledged in the past; that is, in order to relieve the pressure on the public hospital system, it is important to promote the development of nursing homes. So could you comment on that issue, please?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to nursing homes, I would take issue with the fact that many nursing homes offer acute care, as you mentioned, and that they are really a substitute for hospitals. The government does not see that there will be any problem with public hospitals. In fact, this proposal will see the improvement of nursing homes, which could then provide in a more adequate sense for residents rather than their having to go to a public hospital. With the increase in capital funding here, nursing homes will get better; and this will alleviate the need for people to go to hospital. It is quite the reverse of what you are suggesting.</PARA></SPEECH>

That seems to me to be making the assumption that you are going to have a high level of income derived from the bond and the administrative draw downs where this average is achieved&mdash;that is, on average, 73 per cent of beds occupied by people who are not eligible to be treated as concessional residents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That may be manageable&mdash;I will not dwell on the equity of it&mdash;for the sector in areas where a high bond can be charged and a higher level of income can be achieved. But I have a concern about areas, for example, where property values are low and there is a difficulty in raising significant amounts of income in terms of the accommodation bond required. In the arrangement between the Democrats and the government, you have provided for a subsidised rate for that&mdash;on average, 27 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to make the assumption that the organisations that have agreed believe they will have significantly more than 40 per cent of their beds occupied by concessional residents.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So I suppose the real average for the nursing homes that are not in that sector, the group that you referred to earlier&mdash;the religious organisations, et cetera&mdash;may have less than 27 per cent, and they will receive the lower rate for that. Nevertheless, those nursing homes will need to effectively make up the shortfall if the targets that the Gregory report established are met&mdash;or even the government's targets which I understand are less in the short term than the Gregory report targets&mdash;by charging an accommodation bond which is higher than it would otherwise need to be to achieve that level. In other words, if there is a 20 per cent level that is being subsidised and it is about 45 per cent below the full rate&mdash;the $12 per day that Professor Gregory recommended&mdash;they will have to make that up by increasing the bond, and therefore the earnings on the bond will increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of issues about the bond. There are issues about the rate of return on money&mdash;we can take the draw down as a given&mdash;and there are also issues about the

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem for the provider is that if they only want to go for concessional to make it worthwhile they need to perhaps have over 40 per cent. If they only get 50 per cent they still have to find funding from the other 50 per cent. They are still going to go to the accommodation bond residents. They will not be turning people away because they happen to be non&hyphen;concessional. They might have an interest in getting above the 40 per cent mark, but thereafter they would be quite happy to have people who pay an accommodation bond. It is a mix. In those sorts of areas you are describing, I would suggest that you have just that mix.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the amount that I have mentioned for the subsidies, they are covered in that regard and they would be covered by the bond that is paid because you would have the draw down in the first instance and the use of the funds in excess of the draw down. That would be adequate to keep them going on the accommodation bond side and the subsidy to keep them going on the concessional side. When you add them together you get a situation which is agreeable to the provider. I do not see where the problem arises for areas where the properties are of a lower value. I repeat that if you are going to set up a facility in an area where the properties are of lower value your capital outlay is, for a start, going to be lower because the property value is lower.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is partly true, although at the inquiry into funding of aged care all of the calculations that were made were based not on the land value but on the actual cost of construction of the facilities. That is the area that is being sought to be attended to by this measure&mdash;that is, the construction, repair, renovation and maintenance of the facility. I do not think it is reasonable to include the land value in the component. It certainly was
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5366"> not, by my recollection, when we were discussing this with the department. For that reason, I do not think it is reasonable to seek to make that differentiation between the two areas.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I still have some difficulty with the concept that, for a variety of reasons, you could have an area where&mdash;it may be a combination of demand and value reasons&mdash;there are significant non&hyphen;concessional residents to fill all the beds and there are concessional residents who could fill 50 per cent of the beds and there is an economic reason for accepting or rejecting people rather than a needs reason for accepting or rejecting people for occupancy of beds in those nursing homes. What I am looking for perhaps to truncate some of this debate is the modelling basis for the threshold that you provided in this arrangement which was announced two days ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the original announcement was $5 per day for all. Then there was an announcement on 19 June that had a sliding scale of provisions ranging between $7 and $17.10.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just so I understand Senator O'Brien correctly: your concern is that in an area of low property values people would not be able to pay much in accommodation bond and, therefore, the facilities would have to rely on concessional residents. If they could not get enough concessional residents then they would go broke because the remaining percentage of paid accommodation bonds would not be enough to keep the show going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the basis that we struck this agreement, 40 per cent was mentioned by the churches. As I said, they are the main providers in this area and they should know. The $7 subsidy equates with a $26,000 bond. That is a fairly low bond. When you look at a person coming from an area of that sort, if they are going to pay a bond of $26,000 then that is the equivalent of a $7 per day subsidy. That puts them on a par with a concessional resident. So you would be looking at a bond in the region of $26,000 to equate with the $7, as I have mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is realistic to say that a bond of that sort would cover most areas in Australia. The amount of $26,000 is perhaps not exorbitant when you look at the accumulation of assets over a lifetime, even if a person has been on a low wage. So the accommodation bond side of it would not let the  facility fall because, as I said, that sort of bond would give you the $7 subsidy which you would be seeking from a concessional resident anyway. You would have the interest, too, if the money were paid up front, which I failed to mention earlier. That is an added benefit.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That leads me to make this comment: as I understand the evidence that was given before the Senate committee, whilst there is debate about what the averages are, it was indicated that the average bond in hostels was, on one estimate, $26,000 and, on another estimate, $40,000, based upon surveys. There was clear evidence to the committee from the New South Wales group, who estimated that the level of bond that is actually going to be required by many not for profit centres would be in the order of $88,000. On page 12 of the report, the Australian Catholic Health Care Association argue that the amount of $88,500 would be seen as a sort of benchmark figure. So the assertion that the government continues to try to make, that somehow all this is is just a straight extension of what applies in hostels, is clearly not the case with respect to what is going to come out as the average sort of bond figure that is required for nursing homes. Parliamentary Secretary, if you do not agree with those assessments by the providers in the sector, I would like to hear your response to their evidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to hear from you how you believe you are going to continue to have equity of access under this system. A market driven approach whereby the figures are supposed to be set by negotiation means that it is an unequal bargaining position. This government seems to be keen on establishing unequal bargaining positions. The nursing home proprietors are in the stronger position in terms of establishing the level of bond that they want to set so that they can negotiate who gets in and who does not. The resident is really in a position of having to take it or leave it. As I said earlier, they are not choosing to go into nursing homes; they are going into nursing homes because they have to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our concerns and the concerns of groups in the aged care sector, particularly those in the not for profit sector&mdash;this is certainly the position of many homes that look after a greater proportion of concessional residents&mdash;is that you eventually end up with a two&hyphen;tiered system. People in some areas will be able to readily negotiate or agree upon a higher level of bond, whereas in other areas that is not going to be the case, whether it is due to the level of housing prices or income or other demographics. This is why the church organisations, which are largely involved in providing not for profit centres and in looking after the greater proportion of concessional residents, were so keen to get that daily subsidy rate up. They recognised that without a much higher rate of daily subsidy you guaranteed a two&hyphen;tiered system. They were not going to be in the position of being able to attract the income from the bonds that other profit oriented nursing homes would be looking to.

The fact is that your question of the bond is still a viable one for the nursing home because it is something that they hitherto did not have.

With respect to the $110,000, those figures are still coming. We will have them to you shortly. As to the proportion, I am advised that, if you include the state government in the not for profit, it is roughly fifty-fifty.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate to the committee that the Australian Democrats will not support these amendments, and I will give a couple of reasons for that. In response to Senator Forshaw, the Australian Catholic Health Care Association was involved in discussions about the level of subsidy for concessional residents. They produced absolutely pages of figures. For them, the $12 was a minimum cut&hyphen;off. They certainly could not live in luxury, according to that, but they felt they could
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5369"> certainly live within that if the $12 was available for all of those residents once you got over the 40 per cent. That might help you. I do not know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other issues that has not been raised&mdash;and this is in reply to Senator O'Brien&mdash;is that there is available in the area that he is talking about, the low socioeconomic area, $10 million in the first year as an additional assistance&mdash;and I believe that will be adequate for the first year&mdash;and an assurance from the minister that in subsequent years she will look at the further $10 million that is available to see if that is adequate. I am quite sure that I will be talking to her about that and I am sure you will too, because, no doubt, you will want to represent the areas that you are speaking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the reason why the Democrats do not accept these amendments is that we are aware that, from the beginning&mdash;at least that was what was signalled by the ALP&mdash;they were opposed to the whole notion of an accommodation bond. The Democrats have made clear also from the beginning that we were not necessarily opposed to an accommodation bond. Part of the reason for that was the experience that we had had in terms of the ALP's introduction of accommodation bonds for hostels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the ALP want to argue that there is a clear distinction between hostels and nursing homes, and certainly within their system that was true. But in future there will be no distinction between hostels and nursing homes, so part of their argument really cannot apply. Accommodation bonds will apply to the whole of the complex. In other words, it will be an integrated system. In that case, you really have to take that new situation into account rather than simply always arguing for a distinction between nursing homes and hostels, although I know you will continue to make that distinction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In am concerned about the hardship provisions too, but I believe that at this stage we really cannot go beyond the definitions given by the government. It has tried to meet as many hypothetical situations as can be envisaged. Again, if those hardship provisions prove to be inadequate, then I would say that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this is where we will use very significantly the independent review, which will be continuous over the two years, and even within the first three months. If it shows up that the hardship provisions are not working, I certainly will be one who will be going to the minister within that whole continuous review system to raise again those hardship provisions. For those reasons, the Democrats will not be supporting the opposition amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just very briefly: that illustrates really the crux of our concerns about having a two-tiered system. Essentially, the industry was prepared to say, even at this stage, that the average accommodation bond would be $40,000, and that equates to $18 or $12.60. If it goes as high as $110,000, again as some members of the industry indicated, it takes us well and away miles above what will be provided as a subsidy for those who are financially disadvantaged.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="B36">Senator NEAL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That may well be the case. But members of the industry clearly indicated to us that they intended charging more than the $88,000. If they are prepared to say that to us point&hyphen;blank at a hearing when they know they are being recorded, I see no reason to doubt them, despite potentially some incentive to remain below that level. It may well be that the not for profit organisations, who generally aim to have about a 50 per cent accommodation for financially disadvantaged, have that $12 a day; obviously that assists them to some extent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as we have confirmed previously, about half the industry is commercial. Obviously, if they are to comply with the normal imperative of a commercial organisation, certainly they would not be having any more than what is absolutely required of the finan
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5370"> cially disadvantaged sector, bearing in mind that they will only receive $12 a day. That, as you have said, is equivalent to a bond of $26,000, which is well below the average the industry is putting forward of $40,000, and obviously it is miles below some of the top levels of accommodation bonds that will be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The obvious trouble will be that those for profit or commercial organisations will be completely skewed towards a high paying, high asset owning person coming into a nursing home, and those who are not well off will be left to those  not for profit, and sorts of lower level, nursing homes that really cannot attract people who have more money available for accommodation bonds. In our view, that is the inherent trouble with the introduction of accommodation bonds. Also, bear in mind that there may be a distinction only in words between `hostel' and `nursing home', but what it represents is the difference between an optional entry into a hostel and a compulsory entry into a nursing home because of the level of frailty and illness associated with entry into a nursing home.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment proposes a variation to clause 57-2 of the bill by omitting paragraph (k) and substituting a new paragraph (k).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the debate on the previous amendments, we raised our concerns about the principle of accommodation bonds in nursing homes. By virtue of the decision to reject our amendments, the Senate has endorsed that system
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5371"> coming into operation. As I have said before, and as the government and the Democrats are well aware, there are major concerns with respect to these accommodation bonds. For instance, people have been rightly concerned that the bonds will simply be used to accrue further profit to the nursing homes because of the interest that they can earn on the capital funds that are raised and intended to be used for capital improvement in the nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The higher the bond you set, the more money you can  raise, if you are able to get residents to agree to pay those bonds. Given the demand and the necessity for aged people to increasingly use nursing home facilities, one can anticipate substantial amounts of money being raised across the industry at large but, more notably, in particular sectors of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, as we debated in the previous amendments, the not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit sector, which caters, as Senator Neal said, for about 50 per cent of nursing home residents, we believe will not be in the position of attracting substantial bonds in the way that other centres might. Their motivation is not profit making. In many cases those homes are run by charitable or church organisations. Senator Woodley has referred to them in his earlier remarks. They provide, and have provided for many years, tremendous service and commitment to caring for the aged. That is consistent with the similar activities undertaken in the hospital sector by church organisations. There still remains major concern about the use to which the accommodation bonds will be put.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clearly the intention of the government that these bonds will be utilised for capital works. As the minister has said, it is intended that the funds to be raised and held in trust to earn interest for the nursing home provider will be used&mdash;or that interest component will be used&mdash;to improve the stock of nursing homes, to bring them up to appropriate standards where they may not currently exist, to enable them to build extra facilities or expand existing facilities, to create more nursing home beds and to assist with retiring debt. These are all the objectives. Whilst we do not agree with the system of accommoda
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion bonds, we wish to ensure that the intention of the legislation is carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the whole point of the government's reform package is to generate funds for the building, upgrading and refurbishment of nursing homes, it is important to ensure that that intention is reflected in the legislation. If you look at the legislation, there is no requirement in the bill that the funds available from charging accommodation bonds have to be used for this purpose. We are talking about interest, as I have said, and we are talking about $2,600 a year for five years that can be drawn down from the bond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is only fair that if the resident is going to be required to put up a bond&mdash;it may be $50,000 or $80,000; there is no limit on the amount&mdash;to enable them to get access to a nursing home bed and receive the care provided, then they are entitled to be sure, firstly, that their funds are going to be adequately protected through appropriate prudential arrangements; but, secondly, that the earnings off those funds are going to be used for the purposes for which they are intended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have proposed that the bill be amended to spell out in clear terms that it is a requirement that those funds from the bond be used, as we say, to meet capital works costs and to retire debt and, further, to give the added protection that the funds should not be used for a purpose that does not comply with the prudential requirements. I remind the Senate that we are still waiting for those to be finalised and put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment will hold the government to the rhetoric of its legislation and we would ask that the government agree to it. It will put into the legislation what you say this legislation is really all about; that is, providing a means to expand our existing nursing home facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are concerned also that, if the market works as one would expect, nursing homes that are already up to standard or that may be considered to be at the top end of quality facilities will, of course, have an advantage in the market in being be able to charge higher accommodation bonds. They will, therefore, earn greater interest and build up a bigger fund compared to other homes which may be
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5372"> older and not necessarily of the highest standards, as are some of the more recent homes and facilities that have been built. Those facilities, I might say, were built under the program instituted by the Labor government that put some $1.2 billion over those years into expanding our aged care accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of concern to us that there will be situations where the need to either expand the facilities or upgrade them may not be as pressing in a new home as it is in an older home. Nevertheless, the new homes will be able to charge bonds, earn interest and build up a large pool of money. The question then arises, if there is no legislative prescription to ensure that that money is used for the purpose that is intended, then there is no security ultimately for the residents concerned. And let us remember that their heirs and successors would be entitled to the refund of the money that they have put in, less the draw&hyphen;down over the five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say that, whilst the homes are going to be earning the interest, the poor old residents are not. They are not even going to be keeping pace with inflation, low as it may be these days due to the great economic record of the previous government. When they get paid that refund when they leave the nursing home, they get back the amount less the $13,000 if it is over five years. It is not only less that, of course; it is less in real terms because they have not earned any interest on it. So their funds should be appropriately protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are particularly concerned that these bonds do not end up getting used, for instance, for activities that would not fall within the requirement that is intended. So we move the amendment. It holds the government to its promise, its commitment, and we seek the support of the Senate in doing so.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the famous words of Senator Harradine, the Democrats are listening to the debate on this one.

So I will give you a series of questions, Senator Forshaw, to seek from you not necessarily an explanation, but perhaps confirmation that this amendment in essence is the same as the House of Representatives amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reason why I had a question with part (k) of this amendment is that concern was raised with me by Aged Care Australia and by the Uniting Church that it may be too restrictive, not in terms of capital works if it is widely defined, but that the definition of capital works under 70&hyphen;3 may not be wide enough to cover such things as the need to upgrade facilities, particularly in terms of fire escapes and doorways and all the rest of it, which is needed, of course, to get certification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other problem is, in your mind, does capital works costs include things like painting, renovating, fixing up rooms which have become dilapidated, refurbishing or any of those things which are needed to improve the physical capital of an aged care complex? Can you tell me the difference between this amendment and the House of Representatives amendment, which is what I worked on, and whether you are defining capital works narrowly or whether you are prepared to say it can include all of those kinds of things that I have mentioned?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, the government opposes the amendment. It is basically a question of whether you prefer subclause 57-2(k) put by the opposition or subclause 57&hyphen;2(k) put by the government. Subclause 57-2(k) of the bill says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(k)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the approved provider must not use the accommodation bond for a purpose that is not related to providing aged care to care recipients . . . </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That gives you a pretty clear directive. Then subclause 57&hyphen;2(n) of the bill says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(n)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> amounts deducted from the accommodation bond balance under section 57-19 must be used only for the purposes of providing aged care to care recipients;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So we have two subclauses which ensure the bond goes to the purpose for which it was intended&mdash;that is, aged care. The problem with the opposition amendment is that, although Senator Forshaw has clarified that introductory part of his subclause (k), we do have a problem with paragraphs (i) and (ii) because they say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to meet capital works costs;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(ii)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to retire debt.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They do not say what debt and they do not say what capital works. That could be any debt that the provider might have. It might be any capital works that the provider might have. The amendment does not relate it to residential care or to aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government is saying in its proposed subclause is that the money must go to aged care. This proposal by the opposition says that you can pay it towards capital works and you can pay it towards retiring debt, but do they have to be related to aged care? No, it is not in the amendment. So it is not as tight as the opposition would like it to be. In fact, I think they have overlooked that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to Senator Woodley's question, recurrent funding can be used and would be looked at as part of aged care. You would be looking at things like providing curtaining for the home. It would range from retiling the roof to soft furnishings and to painting&mdash;anything to do with the aged care which is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5374"> mentioned in this subclause of the government's. Obviously, that would be something which goes towards the care of the resident; it improves the surroundings in which the resident is living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would submit that the way the government has put it is a more desirable way to term it, because there you are allowing the provider to use it for anything which comes within the aged requirement. As for the prudential requirements, I take the point that the opposition has made in paragraph (ka) that the approved provider must not use the accommodation bond for a purpose that does not comply with prudential requirements. But, in clause 57B of its bill, the government has extensive provisions for compliance with prudential requirements. So, the government would say we cover it there. We are looking at the provider having to invest the bond in accordance with prudential requirements. We are also saying that moneys deducted from the bond must go to aged care and that their bond cannot be used for any purpose that is not related to aged care. We see a problem in the opposition's amendment where it says it could be used just to meet any capital costs willy&hyphen;nilly or any retirement of debt willy&hyphen;nilly.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand where the government is coming from, but it seems to me that paragraph (k), the subject of the amendment, is loose enough&mdash;even considering the question of prudential requirements under 57B&mdash;for it to be possible to use the capital of the accommodation bond at some stage, at some time, for recurrent expenditure, not capital expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you accept that the model requires the investment of the accommodation bond and that only the interest will be available to the provider&mdash;the actual capital might not be used for that, but the interest could be used, as I read (k)&mdash;for recurrent expenditure needs under the definition, as I read it, of aged care, which is fairly broad, it would seem to me that it is something of a leap of faith to say that the provisions of subdivision 57B do not permit the use of the capital by the provider. I may be wrong. I look forward to specific provisions being drawn to my attention which
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would deny the provider the opportunity to actually use the capital under 57(k), subject to his being able to suggest that he was able to repay that money in a timely way. That may or may not be a risk factor, but I question whether that is good policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that the preferred model in the scheme of arrangements that the government is talking about is for the bond to be invested, for the interest to be available and for the interest, as well as the draw&hyphen;down, to offset the costs of interest and principal that the provider has incurred to bring the nursing home up to the accredited standard necessary to be able to charge the bond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I take from paragraphs (k), (l), (m) and (n) is the ability to take the bond and to use part of it for recurrent expenditure, and the ability to take the interest on the bond, if it is invested as profit, but to require the use of the draw&hyphen;down for any sort of expenditure in relation to the provision of aged care&mdash;which could, as I say, be recurrent expenditure. It seems to me that what the government is talking about with this provision is a regime in which we would be creating a pool for capital improvement within the system. Whether we accept that that is a viable model or not, it seems that there are a number of potential problems with the regime as set out in  57&hyphen;2, particularly paragraphs (k), (l), (m) and (n).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to the parliamentary secretary addressing those matters, because I think that they are fundamental to the amendments that the opposition is moving. We are saying that if you are going to have this system, if you are going to have income generated through interest on the bond and if you are going to have income available through a draw&hyphen;down on the capital itself, then shouldn't that necessarily be mandated to be used for the purpose that the government has described as its intention with this bill? That is what we are saying. If you can suggest a better form of words, then so be it. Suggest them, and I am sure the opposition will accommodate them. Alternatively, I think you will need to convince the committee that the outcomes I am talking about are not possible under the form of words that you have in the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5375"> bill as it stands to really satisfy us on that matter.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add to that. Senator O'Brien has dealt with something that I was going to clarify&mdash;he put it quite adequately. Aged care is defined in the bill; it is in the dictionary schedule to the bill. Aged care means care of one or more of the following types: residential care, community care, flexible care. It is clear that recurrent costs are covered within that definition. If you say it is not, tell us how it is not. Capital works are defined in the bill in section 70&hyphen;3.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the point you made about retiring debt, or which debt, we are happy to look at the words there which would restrict which debt would be able to be retired.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to add to that. As a matter of fact, at this stage I do not want to vote for either. I think the parliamentary secretary did raise some real problems with the ALP amendment that I had not thought of. Parliamentary Secretary, I will explain what the problem is that has been raised in many quarters. I do not know if we can get a definition, because the crossover is so fuzzy between the two things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The worry is that the government seems to have been very clear in its pronouncements about what it wants the interest from the accommodation bond and the draw&hyphen;down to be used for. That is that it should be used for improving the physical aspects. I would agree that items such as soft furnishings, curtains&mdash;all of that&mdash;should be included. But the worry is: will providers be able to use, for instance, the draw&hyphen;down and the interest to pay staff&mdash;whether that is nursing staff or gardeners or whatever? That is the question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the problem is the fuzzy line between. But if providers started using the accommodation bond for all of those things, then I think it defeats what the government wants to do, because they would not upgrade the facilities if they could use the funds when
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they have a shortfall in their pay or whatever. Can you see the problem I have? I am not sure whether we are going to be able to get a form of words, but I guess we have to try, haven't we?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we are all in thunderous agreement as to where we are headed, but it is just the path we take. In relation to your question, Senator Woodley, the interest and draw&hyphen;down could be used for staff salaries. That is the government's position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the amendment moved by the opposition, I had misunderstood the wording as mentioned by Senator Forshaw. I just point to another problem that this further amendment does raise. That is, in your wording you say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(k) the approved provider must use any income derived from investing the accommodation bond, and any retention amount, in either or both of the following ways . . .</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What you are doing there is talking about, as Senator O'Brien mentioned, the income from the bond and the retention amount. What that links into is (ka) of your amendment, that is, the prudential requirement. You are not covering the whole of the bond there, as I see it, because what you are talking about there is the income and the retention amount, and saying that both of those must be applied to capital works and retiring debt&mdash;yes&mdash;but you also link them into (ka), which is the prudential requirement. And you have not got the whole shooting match in there when you talk about only the income from the bond and any retention amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am saying  that you have missed part of it in the prudential requirement, because you would have to say basically `the income from the bond, the bond itself and the retention amount'. Also, if you did want to amend it, it might be preferable to have put it in at (n), not (k). So I think that that is a problem&mdash;one that perhaps you had not foreseen.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5376">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While you have a look at that, I would say that, in relation to the wording here, `aged care' does cover all those areas. Obviously, staff salaries is part of it. Also, retiring debt would be part of it, because it enhances the security of the home. It means that the home is a more viable facility, and the more viable it is, the better it is for its residents. It means that if it is not paying exorbitant interest rates on high debt it can use its moneys for aged care purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it comes within that ambit, and that is why the government thought that the purpose of providing aged care to care recipients was a catch&hyphen;all phrase. I invite the opposition to just look at that as to whether they have protected the whole of the payment in the prudential arrangements by just talking about the retention amount and the income from the bond.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The requirement to have them refunded in a timely way is really a little vague. What does timely mean? How quickly is timely?

<PARA STYLE="Para">Following resolution of that motion, we will be seeking to move amendments Nos 9, 10, 11, 12, 14 and 15 together. I will speak essentially to the range of issues covered by this group of amendments which relate to the issue of nursing care. A major issue of concern to many groups involved in the provision of aged care services is the potential diminution of standards, or the requirements to provide appropriate nursing and personal care. I draw your attention to amendment No. 3. That amendment seeks to omit from the bill the words `a high quality of care' and insert, in lieu thereof, the words `a high quality of nursing and personal care'. This is an em
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5378"> phasis that we are seeking to have reiterated in other clauses of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence was given to the Senate committee, and there have been continuing expressions of concern, by such groups as the Royal College of Nursing, the New South Wales College of Nursing and other groups, that nowhere in the bill does it stipulate, for instance, that nursing care has to be provided by registered or enrolled nurses or by people with adequate training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator West, in her speech during the second reading debate, covered this issue very well and spoke, obviously, from experience. She enunciated the concerns of the professional groups. She referred to the skills that staff are called upon to exercise in providing care in nursing homes and the importance of ensuring that there are adequate numbers of registered or enrolled nurses working in nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the interests of saving time, I do not wish to reiterate all those arguments. The government is well aware of them&mdash;as, indeed, are the Democrats. They will recall these issues being raised during the Senate committee proceedings. What I do, however, wish to refer to is the response by the government senators in the committee's report, because it concerns me that this attitude prevails amongst some members of the government. In their minority report, at page 83, in a section relating to an allegation&mdash;the allegation being that standards of care will deteriorate under the new system&mdash;they state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">This is a completely fallacious argument with no basis in fact and is designed to frighten the aged.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The line has been run, and is constantly being run by the government, that the issues raised by the opposition are somehow part of a great national scare campaign orchestrated by the opposition to frighten the aged community. Nothing could be further from the truth and it really is a scurrilous allegation. I must indicate that I did not sit through the Senate committee proceedings; I was not a member of the committee at the time. But, having been given this responsibility at about the time the committee was drawing its inquiry to a conclusion, I took the trouble to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  transcript and the report and I
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> listened to the debate, particularly the contribution from Senator West. I have also had representations from professional organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be noted that Senator Woodley said that he and others have given a lot of time and thought to this issue. There are many centres indicating their concerns in this area&mdash;that they do not want to see this legislation as the vehicle whereby, because there is no specific recognition of these requirements in the legislation, the nursing standards will fall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the government to simply dismiss all of that as some fear or scare campaign being run by the opposition is just, as I said, a scurrilous allegation. And it really is a slur upon the people in the nursing profession, people associated with providing aged care facilities and providing care to the aged. It is a slur on their professional integrity, honesty and commitment to make those sorts of allegations. We did not have to go out and try to scare people. This is not something that is being made up; these are real and genuine concerns felt by groups such as the Royal College of Nursing. They are not going to lightly make these sorts of claims concerning a potential diminution of standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the people who dedicate their working lives to looking after the frail and the aged in nursing homes and other aged care facilities. They are some of the most dedicated workers in this country. Dare I say it, probably many of them are trade unionists. It appears that because they might wear that tag and are members of an association their views count for very little with this government. This government want to malign them and suggest that this is just some nasty plot by the ALP and the unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These expressions of concern and these requests for ensuring that this legislation makes it abundantly clear that professional standards of nursing care and qualified personnel remain are required under the legislation are being put forward by the people who more than anyone know what is required. They are often the only people that nursing home residents have regular contact with. We seek the Senate's support for the amendments
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5379"> that we have moved that relate to requiring aged care services to provide for appropriate access to nursing care services. I do not think I need to go into specific detail in regard to each and every amendment as they pick up that theme and propose the relevant amendments to the sections of the bill that are required.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am inclined to not support the ALP amendments, but they nevertheless raise some very real issues. I am genuinely listening to the debate in this regard. The genuine issues that the ALP raise in this area are particularly the concerns that I have arising out of the inquiry. I did not read carefully enough the government's minority report. Thank you for drawing it to my attention because that is a most unfortunate and unfair statement. Of the evidence received, the most substantial evidence was that given by a number of professors from a number of institutions and from the Australian Nursing Federation. I do not think that they were wanting to scare people. I think they were raising real concerns that need to be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I am having problems with the ALP amendment is that in trying to cure what I see as a potential problem they are creating some other problems. In amendment No. 3 to change `a high quality of care' to `a high quality of nursing and personal care' seems to me to actually be limiting again. The problem I have with it is that it is restrictive. I guess amendment No. 17 is okay, but again I find that pretty inflexible. I do not know that amendment No. 13 achieves anything. It states:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Residential Care Subsidy Principles must specify how much of any *residential care subsidy paid to an approved provider must be used for the provision of nursing care.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How on earth could you specify that? I have such problems with the way you have tried to cure what I believe is a potential problem. I do not think you have got it. I ask the parliamentary secretary: how can we get around this problem?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had discussions with the government and I think what they were proposing to me was in fact very helpful, but I think it might
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> help the committee if we actually have that on the record. There is the potential for rorting of the system and there is a concern that adequate nursing care be provided. I guarantee that it is not going to happen with the not for profit organisations or the church institutions, but I am not sure about some of the for profit providers. I know that the government probably has more faith in some of the for profit organisations&mdash;more faith than I would have in some of them, having seen some of the things that have happened. You can see that we are trying to address a real problem. Could you spell out what the government sees as the answer to this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the previous government, the method that was used to try to guarantee the provision of nursing care was the acquittal method. The problem was that that acquittal method was often three years behind and, in some cases, up to 10 years behind. Really that system was not working. If a staffing problem arose in an institution and you did not find out about it for three years, by that time it had disappeared or got worse. Your system did not work. I am not sure your amendments are getting at the problem, but nevertheless you are describing a real problem. I would like to hear what the government has to say about it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are requirements relating to the level and qualifications of staff employed in any approved residential aged care facility. I might firstly turn to 54&hyphen;1(1)(b). That requires that an approved provider must `maintain an adequate number of appropriately skilled staff to ensure that the care needs of care recipients are met'. That is a bald statement there. It means that each facility should ensure that the staffing skills mix reflects current resident care needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Across the board you will not need nurses in every facility to the same extent. Some facilities will need more nurses than others. That goes without saying. The basic expectation is that services catering for high care residents will have nursing staff to provide supervision and necessary nursing procedures.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5380"> Again, that is something the government is willing to put on record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The prescribed services in 54&hyphen;1(1)(a) provide for minimum levels of staffing to ensure resident safety and supervision&mdash;that is, all facilities must provide 24&hyphen;hour on&hyphen;call staff where there are four or more high care residents classified as category four or above out of the eight categories. Then the services must provide qualified nursing care, where shown necessary by the residents assessed care needs, and qualified 24&hyphen;hour staff cover is to be provided where there are more than seven high care residents classified at four and above. That is in the quality of care principles. In 54&hyphen;1 you have these provisions that go right to the very heart of providing for skilled staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You then go back to the question of the objects which  opposition amendment No. 3 deals with. I totally agree with Senator Woodley that if you amend 2&hyphen;1(1)(b) in the form that the opposition would then you are tying in `high quality of nursing and personal care' as one. What the government is providing is a much broader responsibility and that broader responsibility is to promote a high quality of care and accommodation for recipients of aged services that meets the needs of individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To those who think that the opposition amendment No. 3 on the surface seems to be more targeted, it is. But the trouble is that it casts a more narrow responsibility on the provider. It is the object in the government's legislation that casts a broader obligation&mdash;a high quality of care. That relates to everything, not just personal care, not just nursing care&mdash;a high quality of care. That would mean that you have sufficient railing on stairs, that your lifts allow for elderly people. My parents, for instance&mdash;I declare an interest in this legislation&mdash;are going into a hostel themselves. One of the things they look at is the lift and access to the lift. Designing all that is allowing for a high quality of care generally, that you have a building which can facilitate older people and those who are not as mobile as some of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government opposes amendment No. 17. As Senator Woodley said, this is linked to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amendment No. 13. It requires not less than the amount specified in the principles to be used for the provision of nursing care. This amendment does not recognise that some residential care services will cater for some people who will not require nursing care at all. We believe that it will maintain red tape, which was detested and is detested by providers in the current system. We would agree with Senator Woodley in his comments. I think that covers the points in relation to the three separate amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that Senator Woodley supported my remarks with regard to the comments by the government senators on the committee. I note that Senator Ellison seems to take a more responsive approach on the issue, rather than adopting the rhetoric of trying to belittle the opposition's arguments as some sort of scare campaign. I do appreciate his change of tack, as it were. It is an important issue, and I am sure we all recognise that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming specifically to the concerns or the reasons put as to why the amendments would not be acceptable, I have often heard arguments about whether the words in clauses are so broad that they include everything but then, because they do not specifically include an important factor, they do not really cover everything. The other argument is put by the government that you have to adopt a narrow interpretation of the words `nursing and personal care' in our amendment and suggest that those words exclude any other sort of care. We do not accept that argument. Equally, we do not accept your argument, Senator Ellison, that the current object, which is the use of the words `high quality of care', specifically ensures that where it is necessary, and where it should apply, appropriate qualified nursing care will be available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that your current wording does not enforce that. It does not ensure that that will occur. You might say that that is the intention and that people will do the right thing, but given the attitude that I have referred to earlier from the government senators on the committee that seem to belittle this whole concern in the first place, we
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5381"> have some real concern&mdash;as do the professional organisations&mdash;that unless reference to nursing care, to recognised qualifications, is included in the legislation, then facilities will be able to operate without employing even one  qualified nurse. That would be possible. We would suggest that that is an outrageous situation to arrive at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government is not prepared to accept our amendments, then ultimately the facts will speak for themselves in the future. But we know that there will be operators out there&mdash;there always are; it might be only one or two&mdash;that will see this as removing or not requiring certain standards, not ensuring that there is a presence in their facilities of qualified staff. They will look for ways to ensure that they do not have to meet what is said to be an appropriate standard, but which is not required under the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make a final point about amendment Nos 13 and 17. Again, it is the same argument, but Senator Woodley said that we had the previous acquittal system, the CAM and SAM arrangements, which people were critical of. Whatever the criticisms may have been, Senator Woodley, the fact is that they were there, specified, and intended to ensure that funds granted were utilised in the manner which was intended. Having thrown that system out, there is nothing here that replaces it in this legislation, that requires a demonstration, if you like, that will ensure that the requirements would be met in the future, as they were required to be under the old system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard plenty of criticisms about the old system. The first time I came into the Senate three years ago I became a member of this committee, which I am now back on. There was a debate going on at that time about CAM and SAM. If I heard it once, I heard it a thousand times. What we are endeavouring to do is ensure that the aspect of that system which required that providers not siphon off funds intended for care and put them into other areas continue to apply under this legislation&mdash;albeit that those acquittal methods have been abandoned. What we do not want to see is the other extreme, where you will have facilities which will utilise the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provisions of the Industrial Relations Act and the opportunities that are open there to negotiate outside awards, reach in-house agreements, or demand the acceptance of individual contracts. We do not want to see a breakdown of those standards, ending up in a deterioration in the standards that should be applicable in nursing homes. Those are the reasons why we put them forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do at least appreciate the fact that you are coming towards supporting them, or you support what we are trying to do. That is a start. I wish we could get you to support what we are doing as well, because it is a darn sight better than what is there at the moment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to take up the time of the debate unnecessarily, but it seems to me that there is an understanding of Senator Woodley's objection to amendment 3, but there is his acceptance of some of the principles that we are seeking to address. Perhaps one of the problems is the meaning given in the definition to the term `residential care', which may need to be quite broad, but it is broad enough to be read as possibly excluding `nursing care'. Residential care is `personal care or nursing care, or both personal care and nursing care'. Then there is a determination of what that care is supposed to provide. Clearly, under that definition, it is permissible to provide residential care which includes only personal care, not nursing care. Nowhere in the definitions are the terms `personal care' or `nursing care' defined, from what I can find.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Residential care has two alternatives, for obvious reasons, because in the hostel you might not need that nursing care. I do not think you need to define nursing care and personal care. The words speak for themselves. What you have got with the amendment is a situation where you are talking about `nursing and personal care,' not `nursing or personal care'. That is why we say there is a problem here. It is a situation where you could be casting an undue onus on a

I think  it is a more compendious provision by the government than the one offered by the opposition. We also have the accreditation standards.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sympathetic to what Senator O'Brien and Senator Forshaw are saying because I have the same concerns. The problem, though, is that you do not cure it with a definition. Admittedly, amendments Nos 13 and 17 go towards a mechanism to try and get in place what they are saying, but I am still not convinced that it is any better than what the government, through the accreditation system, is providing. What you will get with the accreditation system is an absolute channelling for anyone who is fair dinkum about providing a proper facility, a channelling into a high quality of nursing care.</PARA></TALK.START>

You can go straight to the issue and say, `In addition to the gofer, in addition to the ramps, in addition to all those things, you have to give me good nursing care.'</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The original proposal for an annual report on the operation of the act was set out and it took up almost two pages. We have reconsidered that proposed amendment and set out in the revised amendment something which is a lot shorter in terms of the requirements for information to be included in an annual report to be laid before each house of parliament each year, but they still go to very important issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that it is essential that there be a reporting process to the parliament by the minister. The Democrats have announced that there would be an annual report to the parliament, but there is nothing in the legislation at this point that would ensure that. There is nothing in the other proposed reviews that are part of the agreement between the government and the Democrats that provides an opportunity for the parliament to make an assessment. The Democrats and the government did not accept our proposed amendment to require in legislation that independent review. But, hopefully, they will support us in this proposal which is to require the minister to provide, as soon as practicable after 30 June each year but before 30 September, a report on the operation of the act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to see that the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996&hyphen;97 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1997 is finally being debated. I think it has been on and off the agenda for the last three or four weeks. I will be very relieved to see it dealt with and I am sure the government will be as well. Essentially, the opposition does not oppose this bill as it improves the method of payment of veterans' benefits and also establishes a vocational rehabilitation scheme for veterans that was initiated by the previous government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The establishment of the veterans' rehabilitation scheme was initiated by a program put forward by Senator Faulkner in 1994. The adoption by this government of this particular scheme must be an endorsement of his original concept and to some extent a back&hyphen;handed congratulation for his initiative&mdash;probably one of the few that will be received by him from this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Effectively, it provides a scheme whereby veterans can be retrained to return to the work force. It also sets up a protection of their benefits that ensures that those veterans who may be reticent to return to the work force because they are fearful that once they lose their benefits they may never regain them if something untoward happens with their job, will be able to return to those benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators are probably aware of many veterans in their electorates&mdash;and I certainly am&mdash;who have been scared either physically or psychologically by their experience in warfare and have not been in a fit state to return to employment for many years. The trouble with these sorts of difficulties is that they were not easily overcome. Sometimes when a psychological problem or psychiatric problem is overcome the pressure of returning
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5394"> to employment, the stress of exposure to the general community and the stress of having to comply with guidelines and the normal pressures of employment can be additional stress on veterans that they cannot cope with.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They may return to the state they were in before and be unable to retain their employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the rehabilitation scheme&mdash;that is, the protection of their benefits&mdash;is a very important part of the program and ensures that veterans approach their rehabilitation with a great deal of enthusiasm and certainty that there is security of that underlying benefit if their attempt to return to employment were to fail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second major part of the bill, which is supported by the opposition, is the rationalisation of payments between the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Social Security. They are in two parts. Veterans or their spouses who are receiving disability pensions can have them paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs where previously they might have been paid by the Department of Social Security. Carers paid by Veterans' Affairs will be transferred to the Department of Social Security. Essentially, it means that whatever sorts of payments people are receiving they will only have to deal with one department rather than a multiple of departments as is the case in many circumstances at the present time. There is an essential benefit for all those receiving payments. It is a simpler and more straightforward system of payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only concern we might have&mdash;and I suppose it will require time to see whether this concern is borne out&mdash;is that the transfer of payments away from the Department of Veterans' Affairs may eventually mean that the purpose of Veterans' Affairs is lost. I am hoping it is not the intention of this government to eventually abolish the Department of Veterans' Affairs in a continuation of their slash and burn approach to restructuring and rationalisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a section of this bill that we do not support and that is the section that reduces the benefits that are payable to veterans. This is done in a number of ways. This government
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> describes it as better targeting of income support benefits. This is done in three ways. The first is the cutting of rental benefits for single persons who are sharing accommodation. You might recall that this issue was debated at some length in relation to the social security budget measures and it is in identical terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It assumes that where two single people are sharing a home and receiving rental assistance somehow their costs will be reduced and accordingly they should see receive less rental assistance. We have had this debate at some length before&mdash;and I suppose we will have it again in the committee stage of this bill, so I do not wish to dwell on it excessively. But it is firmly the view of the opposition that because people share a home and may share the cost of food, groceries and those sorts of expenses, they do not share the costs of accommodation because each of them is required to have their own bedroom, and that is normally the determinant of the sort of rent that is payable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose one of the most callous things about this measure is the fact that the government is prepared to remove it for the people in this category when in fact there are only 340 people who are affected. That means that the savings that are achieved with this particular bill are almost microscopic&mdash;in fact, $21,000. That really is not a very large amount of money to inflict the sort of concern and upset on people who I would have thought the government would have had more regard to, particularly a conservative government that like to fly the flag of patriotism and support for our veterans. Certainly those sentiments did not stop them imposing this particular cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second change that is also really a twin to the changes made under the social security budget legislation is to deem income for those people between the ages of 55 and 60 who have superannuation in place. I must confess that we see this as a betrayal of all the principles that were put in place by the creation of superannuation in Australia. Superannuation was put in place to ensure that people once they retired, not before&mdash;and I would like to emphasise that point&mdash;were guaranteed a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5395"> secure source of income. We really do consider it a complete betrayal of that principle to require people before retirement to access their superannuation. Certainly it is not only a betrayal of those principles but also, I think, essentially short-sighted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one difficulty: by deeming income from their superannuation and requiring those people at aged 55, in effect, to access their superannuation because they will not have the other source of income from their periodic benefits, they will run out of their superannuation before they might have. Eventually, having used all their superannuation and still surviving the same length of time, they will have to  call on the state to provide them with a pension or in some circumstances a larger pension than they would otherwise have had. It is a proposition that we see as being wrong in principle and short-sighted in effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third matter where there is a reduction in veterans' benefits is the discontinuation of the saved eligibility for fringe benefits for some service pensioners. Obviously, it is a fairly small matter but we see any erosion of benefits to our veterans as something that we are opposed to and, being part of this package which erases their benefits, we are in opposition to that proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset, the large part of the bill, the positive aspects&mdash;the introduction of the vocational rehabilitation scheme for veterans and the simplification of the payment of their benefits&mdash;we support, but we do not support the reduction in benefits payable to them. We will be putting forward amendments to those two areas seeking to remove them from the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996&hyphen;97 Budget and Other Measures) Bill we are considering today gives effect to a number of the veterans' affairs related measures which were announced in last year's budget. Most of the measures contained in this bill are non&hyphen;controversial and the Democrats have no problem in supporting them. There are two parts of the bill, however, that we will not be able to support. The first of these, schedule 5, amends the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to remove
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the means test for superannuation assets in certain cases. I will be talking further about this part of the bill once we move into the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of this bill which we will not be able to support is part 3 of schedule 1. This is the section of the bill which reduces the amount of rent assistance payable to single veterans sharing accommodation. Part 3 of schedule 1 mirrors changes to the social security legislation we dealt with towards the end of last year, and the position we are taking today is consistent with the line we took then. While the Democrats acknowledge that this change affects only a small number of veterans, we do not believe that this justifies the implementation of a measure which not only is unfair but also is based on assumptions which are fundamentally flawed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government justify cutting the amount of rent assistance payable to single people who share accommodation because they believe that they can achieve cheaper housing costs than single people who live alone. I would like to point out the main reason we disagree with this assumption. Firstly, people who share accommodation often do so because they are on a low income and they can only afford to spend a limited amount on accommodation each week. The biggest economy of scale these people reap is cheaper rent. Because they pay less rent they receive less rent assistance. Thus the current system already takes account of these economies of scale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, while people may achieve economies of scale other than rental costs by sharing accommodation, reducing rent assistance to account for these savings is not appropriate as, in the department's own words, rent assistance is not intended to meet non&hyphen;housing costs. Finally, I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that the coalition's pre-election social security document specifically stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition recognises the vital role of rent assistance in reducing after housing poverty. A coalition government is committed to maintaining the real value of rent assistance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Once again, the Democrats will not support this government's attempts to break its own
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5396"> election promise. Finally, the Democrats would like to commend the government for establishing the veterans' vocational rehabilitation scheme, contained in schedule 6. This is a measure that the various veterans groups have been lobbying for for a long time, and we are very pleased to see it finally coming to fruition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to briefly address the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996&hyphen;97 Budget and Other Measures) Bill again tonight, specifically looking at rent assistance. I am really sorry that this bill is coming in so late. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill, which this bill mirrors, came in late and was a hurried debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will briefly draw attention to the second reading speech, which talks about the transfer to the Department of Social Security of the payments for carers who were receiving payments under the Veterans' Affairs Act. The second reading speech says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A small number of carers, who could be disadvantaged or temporarily inconvenienced by the transfer, will continue to be paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When I look at what the explanatory memorandum says on rent assistance, I find no mention that people who are continuing under the DVA to receive the carers payments will be exempted from the impact of the cuts to the rent assistance for single people sharing. Yet under the Social Security Act that particular group of people has been granted exemption. I suspect that an anomaly has occurred here. I hope that, in the minister's summing up on the second reading or in the committee stage, he is able to clarify whether in fact there is an anomaly that affects these people who remain carers and disadvantages them even further. I think it highlights the hastiness with which a number of the changes were made to this rent assistance. It does not do anything in any way to reduce my criticism of this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that the minister is going to come up with her usual comments as to why it should be done. However, if the minister were to go and visit a number of the accommoda
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion places in Sydney that I know still exist that offer people rental accommodation&mdash;which will be classified as shared accommodation because these people have to share a kitchen and a bathroom&mdash;she would see some of the grottiest, most revolting, degraded rooming houses in inner Sydney. I might add that these places are charging quite large rents. Such people are affected by this legislation, and I think it is an appalling thing that they are. This issue certainly needs to be debated further. Also when I read the explanatory memorandum, I find that I get a bit confused. The outline on the top of page ii talks about rent assistance, stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will not be applicable to people who have dependant children, pay for their board and lodging, are in a nursing home or receive service pension or income support supplement on the ground of permanent incapacity for work.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When I turn to pages 8 and 9 in the explanatory memorandum, where there is a more detailed explanation, I see nothing there to give me any indication about the people who are in receipt of service pension or income support supplement on the ground of permanent incapacity for work. I wonder whether there is a mistake in the explanatory memorandum. The exemption is mentioned in one part and not in part 3 on page 8.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have concerns when I read the explanatory memorandum because on page 8 under the heading `Explanation of the changes' the second sentence in the second paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a person lives with at least one of their children and that child receives specified government assistance such as AUSTUDY or a social security payment, the person may still be determined to be a single person sharing accommodation, provided the other criteria are satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am still looking for them. We now know that Austudy is about to be changed to the youth allowance and that there is going to be rent assistance in that. What is going to be the impact upon the rent assistance component in this youth allowance payment when the people are in this situation? Is the rent assistance component of the youth allowance going to be modified and played around with because they are living in this type of accommodation, or are they going to get the full rent
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5397"> assistance out of the youth allowance and their parent, who they might be living with, will in fact suffer a cut in their rent assistance? Those are just a couple of the anomalies that I think need to be looked at. I also think that we need to look at the second sentence in the second paragraph on page 9, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For instance, a person who pays most of the bills of a group house, and therefore incurs living expenses that are more than if the person was living alone, might still be determined to be a single person sharing accommodation if the person pays them in exchange for having equal use of a car owned or maintained by another sharer.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This looks like they are creating a problem for a number of people who have disabilities who may share accommodation with people and pay more of the rent or more of the accommodation costs, because in return for that they get assistance to be able to live in a normal situation, so-called, rather than having to live in an institution. These matters highlight a number of questions that need to be asked about this attack on rent assistance and this attack on poor people who live in cities such as Sydney, where the rent and accommodation costs are equal to or as high as anything in the world. Therefore, even people living in very grotty, run-down, low quality accommodation are charged very large amounts of rent. This takes no cognisance of the fact that there are many people in Sydney in that situation who are on low incomes and are paying out significantly large amounts of their income on just the basic rental accommodation. I think that this is something that the minister and the government certainly need to be looking at.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to be brief. I just wanted to make a comment with respect to the deeming of superannuation. Unfortunately, this is a re&hyphen;run of the debate that occurred last year on this measure which is contained in the legislation that is before us. We do have an opportunity to reconsider through this legislation the issue of the deeming of superannuation in its entirety. We made it very clear last year that we thought that this proposal to deem superannuation earnings when a person
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> turned 55 was one of the most vicious measures contained in the budget of August last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since Labor proposed last year a cut&hyphen;off of $250,000 of superannuation assets that you could have before this vicious measure took effect, I would have to say that the community concern on this matter has not died down at all. In fact, as the effective operative date draws closer and closer, the community concern has grown and grown. I am not going to read the entire correspondence into the record, but I just want to give a couple of examples. My friend and colleague Mr Peter Morris in the other place passed on to me a letter from a Mrs J. Neuman. She outlined her and her husband's circumstances. They voluntarily took  redundancy packages in May 1993. A major factor in their decision was receiving social security payments up until the age of 65.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is shocking, Senator Newman, that you are proposing to deal with this issue in the way you are. It is a pity you do not listen to the sorts of concerns that are outlined in this letter. They have received advice that, from September this year, they will lose $60 a week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a letter from a disabled former police officer. He outlines his particular circumstances. There are three people from the north&hyphen;west coast of Tasmania in a similar situation. I will mention them by name but I will not go through the details of the cases. Mr Doug Krushka, Mr Peter Cooney and Mr Brian Youd have either voluntarily retired or have been retrenched. That is an all too common event in Tasmania. They have also been informed that they will loose various social security payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me there is a basic contradiction in the government's approach. On the one hand, we had the announcement in the last budget that persons should not be allowed to access their superannuation over the prescribed timetable that was announced before the age of 60. On the other hand, we have a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5398"> measure here that we dealt with last year that forces people to take their superannuation between the age of 55 and 60&mdash;not in total, but in part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Newman interjected earlier that we had allowed a gateway. We had allowed a gateway, Senator Newman, for a very good reason: for the vast majority of people coming up to 55 or who are already 55, the harsh reality is that finding alternative employment is not easy. Certainly, the considerable majority of cases we have had presented to us at the present time are men who find that the harsh reality of finding alternative employment is extraordinarily difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are, by and large, people who made a decision many years ago to voluntarily put money into superannuation and who sacrificed their recurrent expenditure to boost their  superannuation saving on the understanding that, under the rules at that time and the rules up until December last year, when we passed the deeming of the superannuation provision, if they could not find alternative employment or they were on a disability pension&mdash;as is the case with this former police officer&mdash;they could place their superannuation into some form of vehicle. If they were unable to find employment or if they were on a disability pension and qualified, then they would have access, on the criteria established for unemployment benefits, disability pensions, et cetera, to that social security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people are absolutely outraged by the changing of the goalposts, as they put it to me continually, in respect of the deeming of superannuation. The reality for them is that, in many cases, they will have to draw down on their superannuation to make up for a loss of income as a consequence of the effect of deeming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue that we have encountered&mdash;that all of them have been encountering as they have gone off to their financial advisers, because this measure takes effect from September this year&mdash;is that in many cases they are going to have to unravel their commitments. They entered into a commitment in respect of superannuation. They may have locked away their money until they were 60, 62, 63, or whatever the age. Firstly, they have
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to pay for advice to find out how to unravel their superannuation arrangements. Secondly, in many cases, there are penalty provisions for unravelling their investments early.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two problems I have mentioned are very substantial indeed. It is hitting these people in the community at one of the most difficult times in their life&mdash;turning 55, on a disability pension, or unemployed&mdash;often as a consequence of redundancy. What are we going to tell the BHP workers who are all going to lose their jobs? How can you explain this to the people I have mentioned here in the debate? Senator Newman can talk about gateways all she likes, but the fact is that the set of rules that existed was the set of rules that people made investment decisions under for a very long time frame.</PARA>

I had a meeting with a number of retiree organisations, over&hyphen;55 organisations, over the last few months, and this is one issue above all others about which they complain in the strongest terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, Senator Newman, come September, as more and more people discover they are going to be hit by this provision, I do not think you will know what you have unleashed. It is certainly a very, very draconian measure to treat people who often, for reasons they cannot help, have been made unemployed or redundant&mdash;and there are plenty of them in Tasmania, as we know, Senator Newman, as over the year in that state the unemployment rate has continued to climb.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to enter this debate. I do so, believing that it is a fine opportunity for the whole of the Senate&mdash;in fact, for the whole of the parliament&mdash;to revisit what occurred in December last year. I do not want to deal with all of the measures in this legislation. For many, almost all, of them, the government is to be commended. But I do wish to refer to the matter that other senators have referred to, including the latest two being Senator Woodley and Senator Sherry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to have the opportunity of revisiting this particular matter, because I believe that there has been a degree of misunderstanding. I will be pointing to particular aspects of answers that I was given previously which, whilst going through with a fine&hyphen;tooth comb might have been technically correct, nevertheless, gave an impression that may have misled some readers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the debate on this issue last year, I did ask a question&mdash;and I think it was of Senator Sherry at that time&mdash;about why a person with a house, plus $180,000, plus $250,000 in superannuation, should be regarded as eligible for welfare. I have had time to reflect on that matter. The first thing I would like to say is
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that, in reality, there would be very few persons or couples, as the mythical one in my question, who would find themselves in that very fortunate position of having $430,000 in monetary assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that a home&hyphen;owning married person who is 65 years of age and who elects to retire with $$250,000 in superannuation is not eligible for benefits. However, there are many thousands of other people between 55 and 64 years of age who are much worse off and will be affected seriously by the decision to include superannuation assets in the means test for allowances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of these people, as has been said, are unemployed; some of them are no longer in the work force&mdash;out of choice, as indicated by Senator Sherry. Those are people who made their decision years ago, voluntarily having entered into schemes which took money out week by week&mdash;money that could well have been spent on other things. Those persons made prudential sacrifices for the benefit of their family&mdash;and they are now going to be hit. I might just say that, in my view, we should be encouraging people&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the taxpayer? You have so many people on full unemployment benefits, and younger people who could take those jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leads me to the point&mdash;and I do not think it was to the minister; I do not think it was in her portfolio that I put the questions down&mdash;that I have asked certain questions about the effect of the government's decision in respect of a bonus to those who work until the age of 70. In my view the it ought to be the other way around: that is the bonus for people who want to retire but cannot because they cannot afford to. That is one of the reasons that I am inclined to vote for the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5400"> motion that has been put forward by the Australian Democrats and by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the circumstances, as I have said, many of the people are unemployed and are looking for work, and many of them have family commitments. That is the other thing about this: it does not take into account the number of dependents that people have. A home owning married person aged between 55 and 64 who loses a job and who has $250,000 in superannuation is not eligible for welfare unless their total assets, excluding a house, are less than $176,000. There is an issue of fairness involved in these two situations, that is, the person aged between 55 and 64 and the person aged 65 and over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an example of the unfairness, I submit to the chamber the following examples. A home owner aged 65 years&hyphen;plus with $30,000 in possessions and $250,000 in superannuation savings has a fortnightly income of $772. A home owning couple aged between 55 and 64 years of age who have both lost their jobs would be $192 per fortnight worse off. This highlights the unfairness of the way in which allowees between 55 and 64 years are being treated compared with people over 64 years of age. A couple on a mature aged allowance&mdash;that is, between the ages of 60 and 65&mdash;will get no income support if they have $176,000 in assets, whereas a couple aged 65&hyphen;years plus with $160,000 in assets is eligible for part pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there should be fairness. We should compare the treatment that is now going to be meted out to persons who are between 55 and 64 with what the government is doing to those who are going to stick it out at work until the age of 70. They will get a bonus. Yet those who have planned for many years to retire, who have scrimped and saved for that purpose, who have built up a bank of superannuation, will get absolutely nothing from the government. They are expected to eat into their superannuation savings, when those savings should be used to meet their commitments after they reach the retiring age.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their contributions tonight to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996&hyphen;97 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1997.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Can I canvass some of the matters which honourable senators have raised so far in the second reading debate. I really feel sad, Senator Woodley, that you refer to election commitments but you have no hesitation as a party in forcing us to break our election commitments when it comes to special benefit for migrants or the holding of a constitutional convention. I urge you to think very closely about that, and the consistency of your party's treatment of our election commitments as well. I think it is fair to raise that issue now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I remind the Senate that until 1993 superannuation assets were included in the social security test. They always were until 1993. In the budget last year we proposed to close the door when the horse was starting to bolt. The rorts had been developed by financial planners who were advising people to artificially change their investment arrangements so that they were skewed to superannuation. It meant that different types of savings were being treated quite differently by the social security assets test. Surely it is fair
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to treat all savings the same. I ask the Senate to consider: does the form in which people take their savings really matter? Surely the encouragement of savings, of itself, is of importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should we sit here and prejudice the savings that people in small business, for example, have had tied up in their businesses until they lose their business, until they close down because of illness or for whatever reason, and have been unable to have superannuation and provide the capital and running funding for their business. Just think about that. There are a lot of people in those circumstances. Perhaps over the years there will be more people who have superannuation&mdash;there will be&mdash;but at the current time there are a lot of people who do not have much superannuation at all. Their savings are in other forms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By trying to change back to the other arrangements the Senate is, in fact, prejudicing the savings of people who have not had the tax advantage which is given to those who have superannuation. Senator Woodley and Senator Neal, your amendments will be giving to people who already have tax assistance from the taxpayer for their superannuation, further assistance from the taxpayer by way of special treatment in the social security means test. Surely that is what is not fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to point out to Senator Harradine that allowees have always been treated differently under income and assets tests in the social security system from pensioners. We did not change that. That is exactly as it has always been. You are surely not suggesting that we should be paying people pensions at the age of 55? If you are, when you consider the ageing of our population, when you take into account the direction that OECD countries are going in, which is the opposite direction&mdash;recognising the heavy cost to taxpayers of supporting large numbers of older people on income support&mdash;surely it is better to encourage them, where they can, to remain self&hyphen;sufficient. By having income from work, whether it is from small business or even part&hyphen;time work, they surely are better able to afford the goods and services which can be provided by younger people. They are
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5402"> not taking younger people's jobs; they are providing jobs for younger people. I think perhaps you were not looking at that as well as you might have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry raised the question of the so&hyphen;called inundation of the Labor Party by people who are concerned about the over&hyphen;55s measure. I am advised by my department that the correspondence to the department on this measure has dropped right away since the legislation was passed last December. They keep meticulous records of the correspondence both by way of campaign cards and also by way of letters. In addition, both my departmental officers and I have spent a great deal of time over the last few months&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just listen. We have spent a great deal of time meeting with organisations that represent older Australians. It is not a major issue for them, I can assure you, because really you are talking about the people who are more affluent in our society. I find it amazing that the Labor Party, the party that one would expect to be really more concerned about the people who have little or nothing, is here being advocates of people who have substantial assets, and you want the taxpayer to support them more than they are supporting themselves. I find that incredible and it surely is against all the equitable principles that you supposedly have stood for. I wonder where the Labor Party is going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it absolutely clear that the amendments to the over&hyphen;55s super are not acceptable to the government. The result will be that the Senate will have to account to the veterans community for the failure of this bill to pass. This is a bill, as I have already said, that the veterans are urging should be dealt with speedily. These amendments are simply devices hung on the peg of the veterans bill.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SUPERANNUATION ASSETS OF OVER 55 CUSTOMERS&mdash;EXEMPTIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When this measure was announced on 20 August 1996, the Minister publicly recognised that there would be a need to exempt superannuation assets in certain situations. As the issues involved were complex, the Minister had them comprehensively investigated before determining the details. The Minister can now clarify when exemptions will be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Background&mdash;How Exemptions Can Be Provided</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the income test, the Minister can provide exemptions through making determinations to exempt specified superannuation assets. Under the assets test, exemptions can be provided through the existing asset test hardship rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Situations in Which Exemptions Will Be Provided</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister will provide exemptions for inaccessible superannuation assets. It would be unfair to assess these superannuation assets, because that could lead to a situation where the customer's income support was reduced because of the measure, but where the customer would not be able to compensate for this by drawing on his or her superannuation asset.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Exemptions will be provided where the asset is inaccessible because of a contract entered into prior to the Budget announcement, or because of the rules of the superannuation fund:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> an example is where the customer purchased a "fixed term rollover" prior to the budget announcement where the contract does not permit access until expiry of the term of the contract.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Exemptions will be provided only until the expiry of the contact period as stated at the date of announcement of the measure. Exemptions will not be provided where these contracts were entered into after the announcement of the measure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Exemptions will also be provided where the asset is inaccessible because of a legislative bar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> an example is where the customer is unable to access the asset because he or she does not satisfy any of the "conditions of release" specified in the superannuation regulations for instance because they are working part time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Government has taken steps to greatly reduce the number of situations in which superannuation is inaccessible, through the streamlining of the conditions of release announced in the 1997-98 Budget. The new rules mean that unemployed customers who are not retired, but who are affected by the assessment of their superannuation, will be able to access their superannuation on grounds of financial hardship (subject to the rules of superannuation fund).
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5403">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister will also provide exemptions for traditional endowment or life superannuation contracts purchased before the announcement of the measure. These are usually long term capital guaranteed contracts with a substantial insurance component and maturity bonus' payable at maturity of the contract. It would be unreasonable for customers to be forced to terminate these contracts before they mature to make up for a reduction in their income support.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I foreshadow that the opposition will be opposing schedule 1, part 3, page 11 (line 2) to page 13 (line 18). This relates to rent assistance for single persons. Essentially, we do this for the same reasons I have stated previously in the second reading debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A proposal put forward with the social security budget measures bill moved to reduce the amount of rent assistance payable to single persons who were living in shared accommodation. I suppose the difference between that measure and this measure is that it affects a much smaller group of people and the savings that are achieved are a lot smaller.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have already indicated, it affects a small group of people&mdash;340 veterans&mdash;and achieves a pitiful saving of $21,000 over four years. Veterans really must question why this government would choose to treat this particular group of people so harshly for essentially a very small return in terms of the total budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also think it is necessary to point out at this stage or to remind the government that this is a breach of an election promise. I will remind the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) of the promise just in case she has forgotten or the Australian community have forgotten. The government's pre&hyphen;election document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition recognises the vital role of the payment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, rent assistance&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This obviously is one of those non-core promises, along with so many others, that this government feels it can just disregard. It thinks it can just disregard the effect that this will have on those people in the community who really are the hardest off, the people who are really having it tough. People who are on a benefit and who have to pay exceedingly high rentals will now have the amount of rent assistance reduced so that they will be in an even worse situation.

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments relate to the deeming of superannuation for those persons between the ages of 55 and 60. There has been a great deal of discussion about this matter to date. But I think that, bearing in mind the importance of the issue, it is certainly worth canvassing some of the matters again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of superannuation, when it was first established it was clearly established on the basis that those people putting money into superannuation would put that money aside until retirement at the age of 60 or later, they would have a safe and secure future and those funds would remain untouched until this occurred. The reason was not only to ensure security for those particular persons&mdash;a safety net in retirement&mdash;but additionally it would provide a safety net for the community at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been gathering concern for a long period of time about the capacity of the community to pay for the number of people who reach retirement as the population bulge, the baby boomers, reach retirement age. There was a very strong view that if some provision were not made there would not be a capacity for the government to provide for their retirement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I rise tonight to speak in recognition of the upcoming 40th anniversary of the signing of the Australia-Japan Commerce Agreement. This was commemorated by the 20th Australia-Japan Relations Symposium recently held here in Parliament House, where the future directions of cooperation between our two countries were explored. We also welcomed a delegation of young Japanese political leaders to Canberra at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commerce agreement, signed on 6 July 1957, was the first major trade agreement signed by Japan with a foreign nation following World War II. This came about largely because of the work of former National Party leader, Sir John McEwen. It is doubtful that this agreement, followed by four decades of a stable Japan&hyphen;Australia relationship, would have come about were it not for his persistence and determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before a deal could be made with Japan, Australia needed to come to an agreement with Great Britain over wheat imports  and a number of other bilateral and Commonwealth undertakings that were important at that time.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5406"> In Peter Golding's biography <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Black Jack McEwen&mdash;Political Gladiator</EMPHASIS>, he describes just how difficult it was for McEwen and his department head, John Crawford, to make this trade. Golding later says that a deal was signed after several weeks of hard bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The subsequent Australia-Japan Commerce Agreement was especially significant for the National Party. Prior to the signing, Sir Robert Menzies gave sole responsibility for trade to two then Country Party ministers. This was a very great step forward for my party at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1997, the National Party is still at the forefront of Australia's trade negotiations. National Party leader, Mr Tim Fischer, is both trade minister and Deputy Prime Minister, and at present of course he is Acting Prime Minister. He is held in high regard right across the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region, a region in which he has worked so hard to gain credibility during his whole public life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when our trade is increasingly regulated through the GATT and World Trade Organisation commitments, there are few ways to gain leverage, but exporters are already reaping the benefits of the rapport that the present trade minister has developed over time with our Asian trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is now getting fresh milk into Hong Kong every day. Our cheese is exported to Korea for the first time. Riverina rice has now gained entry to Japanese markets&mdash;and there is more to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Japanese have been our largest trading partners now for nearly 30 years. Last year, our exports to Japan were worth $15.5 billion, one fifth of our total exports. Australia had a trade surplus with Japan of $5.4 billion in the full year of 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We supply over half of Japan's coal needs, and prospects for increased energy sales to Japan are increasingly sound. Japan is our principal market for a whole range of raw materials, food and processed goods, including beef, iron ore, seafood and crude petroleum. Japan is among our main markets for wool, sugar and wheat&mdash;our great primary production exports.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995&hyphen;96, manufactures accounted for 14 per cent of our exports to Japan, and services exports such as tourism and education are growing steadily. In 1996, over 800,000 Japanese visitors came to Australia, generating $3 billion worth of  export dollars. Very interestingly, 300,000 Australian jobs depend on our bilateral trade links, and there is a steady two&hyphen;way flow of investment and expertise between our two countries. There are now far more Australians learning Japanese than in any other country in the world, except of course Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that Japan will remain our most important economic partner for the foreseeable future. A new report from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's East Asia Analytical Unit <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A New Japan? Change in Asia's Megamarket</EMPHASIS> provides an important reminder of Japan's global economic significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996, Japan's GDP grew by 3.6 per cent, and its potential growth rate is steady at around 2.5 per cent. This means that Japan is still able to add the equivalent of two-thirds of the Indonesian economy or one-fifth of the Chinese economy to the world's economy every year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report emphasises the breadth of opportunities opening up in Japan for Australian firms. But to exploit these opportunities we need a stable foundation. The strength and quality of the relationship between Japan and Australia is that foundation built over a period of 40 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was nowhere more evident than during Prime Minister Hashimoto's May visit. But a comment made at the symposium by Tokyo University Associate Professor Tanaka also struck a chord with me when he described our relationship as `a natural partnership'. I believe that the natural partnership he spoke of is in part because we both value our democratic status, and we share a similar outlook on the world, our place in it, our relationship to the rest of Asia and our vision for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Together we built a relationship ahead of time, because both countries needed a trade relationship earlier than our less developed neighbours. Now, in economic terms, the rest
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5407"> of our region has substantially caught up with us and, in some instances, has surpassed us both. But the importance of our relationship is very strong.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Which brings me to my final point&mdash;the security of the region. As the two leading industrialised democracies in the region, we share many security policy objectives, not only in the region but globally. Our approach to China, our relations with the United States and our participation in APEC are all important to both countries. Most recently, our willingness to assist with the maintenance of peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula has also stood us in good stead with our Japanese friends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prime Minister Hashimoto's announcement that he would assist our entry to the Asia side of the Asia-Europe Meeting&mdash;ASEM&mdash;is proof positive of Japan's continued willingness to nurture the relationship that was established on a formal basis in 1957. I hope that the foresight and spirit of cooperation that marked our earlier relations with Japan continue to feature strongly in our modern dealings&mdash;40 years on this year from those very important beginnings back in July of 1957.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5407"><TITLE>Auscript

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked about the content of the report and was told by the secretary of the department, Mr Skehill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was a report which identified a range of options&mdash;one of which was retention in public ownership, one of which was privatisation and there were some subvariants on that. It costed each of those options. It concluded that the cheapest option in terms of net present value was retention, but it also noted that that was a strategy with some risk. It would only be the cheapest option if a whole range of initiatives could be successfully taken and sustained and if the client base was retained as well.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I asked why the option was not accepted by the government from a person who was then asked to do the review. I was told by Mr Skehill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You may be aware that the government has consistently, with the National Commission of Audit and a number of other initiatives, established what is known as a series of privatisation decision principles or a decision tree. This provides a structured basis on which consideration is given to whether commercial undertakings of the government are retained in public ownership. The government's view was that there was no overriding or compelling reason in the public interest why Auscript should remain in public ownership. In accordance with the established government policy, it decided to offer Auscript for sale.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One wonders why they conducted a review in the first place. As I said, we have asked for a copy of the final report&mdash;there may be commercial-in-confidence matters pertaining to it&mdash;but we have not received it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who work at Auscript were described to include many dedicated and talented people. We are talking about 300 people in all. Some 90 of them are permanent full-time employees, and some 200 or 210 are casual employees. For the 90 permanent full-time employees, an amount of $4,273,000 has been allocated in the budget for possible redundancy payments. For the 200 or 210 casual employees, there is no allocation. There is no entitlement to any form of redundancy payments whatsoever. I asked a few questions about the nature of the people who work with Auscript and was told by Mr Reaburn, the deputy secretary of the department, that a number of those casual workers
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5408"> at Auscript had worked there for over 20 years. They walk away with nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter was of concern to me during the estimates committee hearing, but it was brought home to me with a real shudder today when I received a letter from a constituent, incidentally, in Perth. I do not have the permission of the individual to use their name, and it probably would not be appropriate that I do, but it is appropriate that I read into the record some extracts from this letter. I quote part of it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The majority of court recording officers are female. The position, although specialised, does not allow for career opportunities, further training or promotion. Scope for re-employment is limited, especially with the recent massive reductions in court hearings in all judicial areas, because of increased costs, beginning on January 1 this year, and increasing again on July 1.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, most of us work out of financial necessity. Our circumstances of employment have a much valued flexibility of choices of days which enables us to organise our private responsibilities, especially regarding family matters, and still maintain a degree of much needed income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the classification of "casual" for which we are being punished. The flexibility comes at a high cost to us as employees; we are not truly casual, in the commercial sense of the word. Our employer, the Federal Attorney-General's Department expects us to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> be available for a minimum of 3 days per week, for 7 hours each of those days notified one week in advance;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> be available to continue working in a court hearing, without notice, if the court decides to continue the hearing beyond normal working hours, often until late at night;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> not expect a guarantee of work on the minimum 3 days we must set aside, so that when we phone in, as we must, the day prior to working we can be told: Sorry, no work tomorrow; or we can be told to come to work, but sent home after 3 hours, if there is not enough work;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> maintain the 3 days availability at all times, even during the downturn in demand;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> give a month's notice of holidays, and after being off the roster for 1 month, Auscript reserves the right to re&hyphen;consider our "suitability" for placement back on the roster;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> wait for 10 days before payment for each fortnight's work, even though we are dismissed at the end of each day's employment.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These conditions preclude the possibility of effectively taking on another part time or casual position, so we have a choice of "liking it or lumping it". The limited availability of flexibility in the workforce for women, especially in Perth means that we have maintained our employment with Auscript at times to our detriment, especially over the last 12 months where we have had only one day, if we are lucky, per week employment.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now that Auscript is being sold, `casual' staff, who represent the major part of the workforce in Auscript, especially in the production area, will not be entitled to any redundancy package or benefits, apart from long service leave for those who have worked 10 years or more.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we had not remained with the Government but sought employment in the private sphere, such conditions would not apply. Long service leave is available after 7 years, and redundancy packages are available to true casual staff, such as was the case for Coles Fossey recently in Perth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am given to understand that the union that represents a large number of the workers with Auscript are seeking negotiations with the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department to try to get some justice for this relatively large group of workers. Certainly, they are, in the words of Mr Reaburn, `dedicated and talented people'&mdash;people who have been relied on to provide a valuable service in the past. I wish those negotiations well. I wish there was something more positive that I could do to assist their cause. I hope that, in the end, they will get justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other two individuals whom I want to refer to tonight&mdash;and they have not been told that I am going to refer to them, so they will probably be embarrassed if they are watching&mdash;are two individuals who provide an invaluable service to every senator in this place. I refer to the officers who are currently employed in the Senate Transport Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know what their future is and I am not sure that they, in turn, know what their future is. I know the government have made mention that they have made some decisions about the future of the Transport Office. But again, as I said earlier, as with so many of the decisions of this government, they have not been notified. We, as senators, have not been notified in a formal sense of what is going to happen. The minister appeared on a television program one Sunday some weeks ago and laid
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5409"> out what is going to happen, but I have seen no paperwork to show what is going to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have two very dedicated individuals, one of whom has been with the Senate for 13 years, Kearen Finn, who has a very uncertain future. I do not believe that is good enough. In mentioning Kearen first, that is not to in any way denigrate the value and the use of Bruce Greentree, who is also employed in that office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very callous of the government to treat Mr Greentree and Ms Finn in this way. I hope that their situation can be resolved at an early time. I understand from the minister's decision that the Senate Transport Office is going to close, that we will not, when we return here in August, be seeing the smiling, happy faces of Bruce and Kearen. I take the opportunity in a personal sense to wish them all the very best for the future. I am sure I am doing that on behalf of not only all my Labor colleagues but every senator in this place.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5409"><TITLE>East Timor</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak tonight not long after the elections in Indonesia are over. I am speaking about the human rights situation in East Timor, and the Indonesian military crackdown in Baucau. The Australian government should urgently protest to the Indonesian government and report the following alleged human rights violations to United Nations fora: firstly, the capture of Falantil leader David Alex and three other Falantil members on Wednesday, 25 June at 9 a.m. at Otabubu Kaibada Uaimua Baucau and the alleged killing of David Alex on 26 June 1997; secondly, the alleged capture and rape of two young Timorese girls inside an Indonesian military post at Baucau in the evening of Wednesday, 25 June 1997; and, thirdly, the alleged capture of 60 young Timorese in Baucau in the evening of Wednesday, 25 June 1997 and the subsequent murder of two youths by the Indonesian army.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are just the latest in a range of abuses that encompasses the deteriorating human rights situation in East Timor since
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Indonesia's national elections and since the award of the Nobel Peace Prize.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The news today that David Alex has been killed has come from varying reports. Our own government intelligence, which seems to coincide with the Indonesian government line, is that he was wounded in an armed skirmish and that he died in capture. However, there have been other reports of death by extrajudicial killing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government is relying on such sources, they should not rely solely on information from the Indonesian government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We must re&hyphen;send Ambassador John McCarthy to East Timor&mdash;where his visit may have coincided, ironically, with this violence&mdash;to monitor the human rights situation and find out how David Alex was killed and the reasons for his death. We need to know whether he suffered torture before his death and whether he died in a helicopter, in custody or during questioning, as conflicting reports have indicated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">David Alex was the hub of the resistance and the primary strategist behind the East Timorese armed resistance. It is a blow to the East Timorese movement that the Indonesian government have stepped up their military tactics. The violence of the Indonesian military, which is all&hyphen;pervasive in East Timor, is not just confined to the armed resistance, but to civilians as well. There are unconfirmed reports of further rape and capture of East Timorese youths in Bacau, where the military are taking revenge for the killing of Indonesian soldiers some weeks ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There should be an inquiry into the death of David Alex and the recent Indonesian crackdown and human rights violations in Bacau. This inquiry should be full and independent. There is no point calling for a report into David Alex's death that relies only on the Indonesian government's story and is a narrower examination of the rapidly deteriorating human rights situation in East Timor at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to quote some parts of a press release we received this evening from the East Timor International Support Centre. It reads:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5410">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are deeply concerned over the safety of five East Timorese arrested together with the Baucau commander of the East Timor armed Resistance, David Alex. Indonesian authorities refuse to disclose their whereabouts and our sources indicate they might be detained in the Rumah Merah Indonesian military torture installation in Baucau. At the present moment, there is a very heavy presence of troops in Baucau, 130 km from the capital Dili.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a very strong likelihood that the five are currently being tortured. The use of torture is a common practice of Abri&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">My final quote from the press release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nobel Peace laureate also urged Western nations to stop selling arms to the Indonesian forces, to end the war in East Timor.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to stress the need for the government to put into place a system to protect unit trust investors. When unit trusts fail, immediately there is a fight to escape responsibility and all parties rush for their lawyers and the courts. In the end, it is these latter group that reap in the money from the unit trust failures. These problems in the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> superannuation industry were solved with your assistance and your participation, Madam Deputy President, many years ago and we now have a sound system of prudential regulation under the Insurance and Superannuation Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the release of the report of the Wallis financial system inquiry, the FSI, into the financial system, there has been a new found interest in the checks and balances that are needed to deliver optimum levels of investor protection. During the next few months the government will be examining its position with a view to arriving at a policy which hopefully will deliver appropriate prudential controls. The regulation of the funds management industry is a key component of our national savings, which needs the attention of government if it is to create a safe and certain environment to grow our stocks of national savings. Regrettably in the past there have been some significant losses in the collective investment area&mdash;notably with the Australia&hyphen;wide Group. In fixing our savings problem we need to do so on a broad front.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compulsory superannuation and the recently announced budget measures that will provide a universal rebate of up to $450 per year are but two measures to boost savings. Cutbacks in public expenditure to ensure a move towards balanced budgets in two year's time and budgets in surplus are also part of the national savings agenda. Investor confidence and efficiency in our fund raising industry are two measures which are integral to turning around our savings industry. In Australia we now find that one in three Australians own shares. The Australian Stock Exchange is number 10 in the world in market size and its efficiency rates are second only to that of the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Investor confidence is to a large extent driven by the scope and extent of government regulation in the capital markets. In any move to tighten regulations to protect investors, it is important that investors not be given the impression that, regardless of the degree of prudence and honesty exercised by those with whom they have entrusted their money, they will not face the prospect of losing part or all of their capital fund. This was the matter that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5411"> Wallis looked at in examining whether or not there was an implied guarantee attached to bank products&mdash;and the jury is still out on that one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wallis concluded that disclosure should be the starting point for all deposits and investment products. If a product has a high degree of prudential protection, then the level of disclosure should be commensurately low. On the other hand, if the product has a low level of protection and regulation then the disclosure level should be high. While this is fine in theory, it does need some qualification and Wallis and his team were prepared to do this. Wallis concluded that compulsory superannuation contributions should have the protection of the type provided by the ISC and that this function should come under the aegis of the new prudential regulator who would also have control of bank deposits. It also recommended that there be an anti-fraud recovery device and went so far as to give a formula for its particular operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the non&hyphen;super domain Wallis concluded that a collective investment review should be implemented, thereby bringing superannuation and non&hyphen;superannuation savings under similar systems of prudential control and supervision. However, in the non&hyphen;superannuation area certain points of distinction should actually be drawn. Here the deposits of voluntary disclosure levels are high and in accordance with the Corporations Law investors are actually advised that their capital sum may be at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the advent of the savings rebate and with the benefit of hindsight of fund failures, such as the Excelsior superannuation plan, Estate Mortgage and the recently settled Australia&hyphen;wide debacle, all of which are know to you, Madam Deputy President, it is time for the government to deliver an enhanced regulatory arrangement to better protect the non&hyphen;super investment products. But if we were to survey the many retirees who lost their savings in the Burns Philip&hyphen;Estate Mortgage disaster or if one were to speak to the 23,000 or so mums and dads who lost a total of $145 million following the mismanagement of the Australia&hyphen;wide fund, and then spend five years chasing the manager and the trustee company only to made $100 million, I am
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sure that these people would say that politicians do have a responsibility to do something to protect their interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, if one were to speak to those Victorian state and federal politicians who had to prepare a government response to the late 1980s financial meltdown in that state, they would no doubt say that prevention would have been far better than cure. I add here that it was only because of the intervention of the ASC that the Australia&hyphen;wide investors actually made any headway at all. I seek the leave of the Senate to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> an article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> dated 3 June 1997.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The article read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TRUSTS OUTCOME COLD COMFORT</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The $100 million settlement last week of the Aust&hyphen;Wide Trusts court case was a victory, of sorts, for the thousands of unfortunate mum and dad investors who sank $145 million into trusts managed by Ron Kerr and Henry Townsing's Aust&hyphen;Wide Group.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And a victory for ASC chairman Alan Cameron, who has been keen to assert his credentials as a defender of the small investor's rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the settlement is still cold comfort for investors as a group because it highlights the abject and utter failure of successive Australian governments to put in place a simple and effective mechanism to protect the interests of unit trust investors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After a never&hyphen;ending series of studies, reports and inquiries into possible reform of the unit trust industry, the regulatory and legal framework that allowed the Aust&hyphen;Wide debacle to take place still remains largely intact today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Way back in 1992, the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee's Collective Investment Review panel, headed by investment banker Mark Burrows, came up with a set of recommendations on how to make unit trust and other "collective investment" type schemes safer and more transparent for small investors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CIR report was enthusiastically supported by the then Labor Attorney&hyphen;General, Michael Lavarch. However, the recommendations of the CIR report never made it into legislation, largely thanks to a long campaign by the trustee company industry against its implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CIR report identified that one of the main structural problems with the regulation and supervision of the unit trust industry was the problem of dual responsibility&mdash;with the task of investing the funds and safeguarding the investments split between a manager and a trustee.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5412">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CIR identified that when unit trust investments went bad, investors in the trusts had difficulty recovering their losses because of the fuzzy issue of who they had to sue&mdash;the fund manager or the trustee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Invariably in such cases the management company had little capital or had gone broke, so there was little sense in investors suing a bankrupt company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, when they tried to recover their losses from the trustee, the self&hyphen;professed guardian of investors savings, the trustee invariably argued that the losses had been caused entirely by the fund manager.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, investors went round and round in circles chasing the passing buck.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CIR group's answer to the agony of small investors was to create the concept of a "single responsible entity"(SRE), in other words a place where the buck stopped when investors had lost their dough.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SRE could either be the fund manager or the trustee, but it could not be both. As a further protection for investors, the CIR group recommended that fund managers have minimum levels of shareholder capital (suggested minimum of $10 million), back&hyphen;up insurance, and be subject to rigorous licensing and scrutiny by the Australian Securities Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a further level of protection, the directors of any SME would be jointly and severally liable to make up any losses suffered by investors. In short, if unit trust investors lost money and the fund manager was at fault, the directors of the fund manager all lost their houses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Five years later the recommendations of the CIR report are gathering dust in a cupboard somewhere in Canberra. The Wallis committee dusted off the report for a quick read and recommended the adoption of the "single responsible entity" approach to unit trust management and investor protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So now the problem of how to protect investors in unit trusts rests with the Treasurer, Peter Costello, whose department is looking at introducing a new regulatory framework on collective investments in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But don't bet on it. The Trustee Company industry earns around $100 million a year in fees as the "investor watchdog" on unit trusts, an annual stipend the industry is loath to give up.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The trustee companies know too well that, if the SME concept is adopted, most of the major fund managers in Australia will stop using trustees for public unit trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In essence trustees would be left monitoring all of the unit trusts managed by small, high&hyphen;risk fund managers, without any of the big juicy trusts where there is absolutely no risk at all.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Trustee Company Association, which represents the industry's 17 major players, has defeated all previous attempts to change the regulatory regime for unit trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The TCA is a dab hand at twisting arms in Canberra and no doubt before long Peter Costello will be besieged with phone calls from backbenchers, worried that he's about to throw the mum and dad investors of Australia to the wolves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How Costello handles the issue of unit trust regulation will clearly provide a signpost on how effective he is in handling well&hyphen;organised interest groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unsurprisingly, in a circuitous piece of logic, the Trustee Company Association managed to turn the potential embarrassment of the Aust&hyphen;Wide settlement into an argument against the adoption of the SME concept.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Aust&hyphen;Wide case, the Australian Securities Commission took court action against Permanent Trustees, the trustee of Aust&hyphen;Wide trusts, on behalf of the 26,000 investors who had lost all or most of their capital.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASC argued that Permanent Trustee had failed to discharge its duty under the trust deed, and in common law, to protect the investors in the trusts. Without making an admission, Permanent contributed $26.6 million to the $100 million pool of funds that will be used to repay the Aust&hyphen;Wide investors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the settlement, the TCA issued a statement arguing that the settlement showed the benefits of the dual responsibility system. TCA national director Don Blyth said: "When funds fail, it is the trustee that remains solvent while the fund manager is insolvent and not worth suing."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps. But what Blyth might also have pointed out was that if Permanent Trustee had been doing what the trustee company industry claims to be doing for investors, the Aust&hyphen;Wide investors would not have lost $145 million in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And while $100 million for the Aust&hyphen;Wide investors is a good result in the circumstances, the 26,000 mums and dads are still massive losers overall.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were two trusts involved in last Friday's settlement, the Aust&hyphen;Wide Trust and the Flexi Property Fund, funds from which had been channelled into other Aust&hyphen;Wide Trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the $59 million invested by Aust&hyphen;Wide, investors will get back roughly $33 million. Of the $86 million invested by Flexi, some $64 million will come back. In round numbers they've recovered 57 per cent and 74 per cent respectively of their starting point investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, the investors in Aust&hyphen;Wide and Flexi lost 43 per cent  and 26 per cent  of their
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5413"> original capital (and more if inflation is taken into account) and received no  income for approximately eight years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As most of the Aust&hyphen;Wide investors were retired, or approaching retirement, the ultimate bill for the Aust&hyphen;Wide mess will end up with the Government, which will end up paying higher pensions than otherwise would have been the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps Costello can send the bill to Permanent Trustees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ivor Ries</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Senate superannuation committee, during its inquiry leading up to the passage of the SIS bills, devoted a considerable part of its time to developing the right regulatory regime to protect investors in superannuation. The final committee report supported the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission report commissioned in the wake of the Estate Mortgage crash. Essentially, SIS followed a single responsibility path&mdash;that is, combined the roles of the trustee and the fund manager and set out in legislation their fiduciary obligations to members: to ensure that there are proper compliance plans and procedures; that opportunities for fraudulent behaviour are minimised; that the investment strategy is in accordance with the trustee; and that any promises made by the beneficiaries to the fund are in fact honoured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of this, one must have a strong prudential regulator who can swoop on a fund as soon as there is a hint of non-compliance with the capacity to use the full weight of the law to punish dishonesty and negligence. Managing other people's money is a serious business with serious consequences if the job is done less than honestly or less than prudently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on the superannuation committee took an `at source' or ex ante approach to the regulation of a unit trust. It can only be that the responsibility of ensuring that a member's funds are protected should rest with a single party, not with two or three which can lead to confusion and commercial uncertainty and also the buck passing that I referred to earlier. This was the reasoning behind the ALRC report and became the basis for the SIS recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How would it be, to use an analogy, if the shareholders in BHP had their moneys con
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> trolled by two boards of management? Who would they blame when something went wrong? Which board would have responsibility for what functions and how could their collective performance be gauged? This is the type of uncertainty that reigns in our non&hyphen;superannuation managed investments currently. It is time that action be taken to rectify this obvious problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, 1.5 million Australians have about $100 billion investments in this segment of the financial sector&mdash;a huge sum, about two&hyphen;thirds of the total market. Funds under management are growing strongly at about 14 per cent annually. This is clearly an area which needs both the government's  policy-making skills and the finance industry's cooperation. I am confident that a regime can be found which will bolster investor security in this critical area of national savings. The sooner this can be done the better.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5413"><TITLE>Northern Territory Planning Authority</TITLE>

Ineffective opposition is fatal to effective accountability. This situation has apparently led to a few arrogant and tired government members running to their own
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5414"> agenda and riding roughshod over people in the Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, in particular the Department of Lands, Planning and Environment, has been criticised for making its own rules and not being accountable to anyone. I am told that people appearing before the Northern Territory Planning Authority Commission can be told the committee is the wrong forum to raise their grievances or concerns, yet no other forum is available. It appears the only other avenue is directly to the Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment. Here, I am told, their letters may be acknowledged but not actioned, their appeals may be disregarded and their cries for a more equitable system fall on deaf ears.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am told of considerable disquiet by the people of the Northern Territory and an increasing distrust of the Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment. Some Northern Territory residents find it difficult to work effectively with the current regime. The Darwin Lord Mayor, Mr George Brown, this month announced he would resign over the Northern Territory's contempt for residents' wishes. It was reported he told the Parap Resident's Association meeting that he had had enough of government interference in planning matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that the determination of the Northern Territory Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment on public land sales is neither public nor open and is carried out at the expense of the environment and the concerns of residents. Open government means making the process of planning and approval transparent and open to scrutiny, but the Northern Territory scenario is apparently neither of these. I am advised that the minister meets directly with developers and holds private consultations with key development groups prior to the direct sale of crown land. I will explain further problems being experienced with the direct sale of land a little later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am told the government recently bought back a property and house which was built on a known flood plain. We must ask: why did the government approve building on land which has a 50 per cent chance of flooding
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> every year and was never supposed to be developed? Why has taxpayers' money been used to buy back this property when the developer walks away with his money? Will the government recover this money from the developer? Will the government now go ahead and buy back other properties built on zone 2 flood land? The precedent has, after all, been set.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is reported that the Northern Territory government has offered unacceptably low compensation to landowners in its drive to resume land for the Alice Springs to Darwin rail corridor. Even given the natural desire to maximise self&hyphen;interest in these matters, such claims do need care. Fairness always has to prevail when compulsory acquisition is being actioned. Are the government's valuations for land based on current market values and a fair return? Why then have some offers been so low in the first instance and substantially increased at a later date?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In rezoning matters, the Northern Territory government apparently repeatedly goes against its own Darwin town plan guidelines. Why does the government support and approve changes to formally agreed land zonings? Will it place on public record its reasons for approving rezoning applications?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned earlier, another area of contention between the people of the Northern Territory and its monopolistic government is the disposal of crown land by direct sale method. I am told that the Northern Territory Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment works on a `closed door' basis with no transparent scrutiny resulting over the direct sale of crown land. The public are often unaware of such sales and left in the dark when the public notice fails to mention that crown land has been part of a consolidation application. Often the annual report for the Northern Territory Department of Lands, Planning and Environment is the first report to mention the actual number of direct land sales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1995-96 report indicates that 33 direct sales were completed in the year, but as the direct sale of crown land is not a publicly visible process in the Northern Territory it begs to be questioned. Was this the total number of sales and why was the land not
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5415"> able to be sold by auction or by public tender? There have been allegations that the government has, through direct sales process, made exchange deals directly with developers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is alleged that there has even been land subdivision and consolidation applications which combine private land with vacant crown land, signed by a government employee. Is it correct and appropriate for government employees to sign and submit such applications? Does this not possibly represent a serious conflict of interest between the department representing the crown estate on the one hand and the eventual beneficiary of the vacant crown land on the other?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would appear that a culture is developing in the Northern Territory where development submissions are frequently seeking variations to the zoning and building guidelines. Developers set about selling their ideas and plans before gaining zoning and building approval. Variations are now apparently seen as the rule rather than the exception. Examples of this include the historic walkway to the Port of Darwin. Despite public opposition, a walkway from the Darwin plateau down the escarpment is being destroyed by development currently under construction. It is legal opinion that this walkway is a public highway at common law and should never have been interfered with by such a development. I am told that residents' objections have never been acknowledged by the Northern Territory Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment, and the work has simply proceeded unimpeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other contentious decisions include the development of the foreshore escarpment area overlooking Stokes Hill Wharf and Precinct. This picturesque gateway to Darwin City is under threat of development into private dwellings. I understand the most suitable use would be public open space accessible for all. Any development along the escarpment other than parklands is not in keeping with the vision for this area as expressed by the former Northern Territory government in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Future direction for Darwin</EMPHASIS> document of 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The vision, which sets out an appropriate environment for the growth of Darwin, pro
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> posed to establish a metropolitan parkland system with direct orientation to the sea. It clearly states that `the challenge is to ensure that the city's character, natural beauty and environment are not destroyed by haphazard or unthinking development.' In August 1990, the Chief Minister, Marshall Perron, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both Darwin and the tourist industry are set to continue their phenomenal growth, and we must ensure that we do it right. That means making our city even more attractive to tourists and residents, planning ahead to maintain our lifestyle and Darwin's uncrowded appeal, and capitalising on our unique physical, historical and cultural assets.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">From reports, it appears that the Northern Territory ministry for lands, planning and development has lost or is losing its way. It must not become entrapped by developers intent on developing at any cost, regardless of the concerns of residents or those who have the long-term interests of Darwin and the Northern Territory at heart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was heartened to learn this week that one residents' group had been successful in their call for a halt to a controversial multi&hyphen;storey development in Darwin.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I acknowledge that many Skillshare projects provide an effective service to job seekers in terms of skills training, job search training and employment placement assistance. But no labour market program saves the Government money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Access Economics report entitled Net Budget Impact of SkillShare, released by the National Skillshare Association in July 1996, concluded that SkillShare created a net average gain to the Commonwealth Budget of around $500 per participant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I believe that a number of the assumptions used by Access Economics were not correct. The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has released a paper which revised Access Economics calculations, correcting for assumptions where my Department's information is more accurate. These revised estimates show that SkillShare does not provide a net saving to the Budget but rather costs about $840 per participant. My Department's analysis also shows that all programs have a net cost to the Budget.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Senator wishes, my Department would be glad to provide him with a copy of its assessment of the Access Economics report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Funding for the SkillShare program has been reduced by one&hyphen;third in 1996&hyphen;97. This is part of the overall savings to labour market programs in 1996&hyphen;97. I appointed an independent body, the SkillShare Services Review Committee to review the national SkillShare network and consider submissions from existing SkillShare sponsors for funding from 1 October 1996 to 30 June 1997. As a result, over 380 SkillShares projects continue to provide training and assistance for jobseekers across Australia in 1996&hyphen;97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) In the 1996&hyphen;97 Budget, the Government announced major changes to the way in which employment services are delivered to job seekers. The new arrangements were expected to come into effect in December 1997. Subject to the passage of legislation, it is now anticipated that the new employment services market will come into effect in March 1998. My Department will no longer contract LMP providers such as SkillShares to provide training courses and work experience for unemployed people. Instead organisations will be contracted to provide individually tailored packages of intensive employment assistance for eligible job seekers, along with labour exchange services and job search assistance. Effective Skillshare projects are ideally placed to be contracted as employment placement enterprises under these new arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The University of Queensland does not have a formal University&hyphen;wide policy on plagiarism. However the University Statute No.13 concerning student misconduct includes cheating and intentional plagiarism as examples of misconduct. Handbooks issued by the University's academic departments for the guidance of students doing courses offered by each department contain information on and definitions of plagiarism.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2), (3) &amp; (4) It is difficult to generalise but it is a conventional practice that students of higher education institutions work independently on work submitted other than duly acknowledged joint work.

The range of penalties imposed on a student who fails to correctly acknowledge sources used in the preparation of work submitted for the conferral of a degree, or who submits the work of others purporting that the work is his or her own, includes loss of credit, suspension of attendance, and expulsion from the institution.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funding provided by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs is not allocated or reported on the basis of electoral boundaries. The information provided below has therefore been compiled on the basis of data available at the postcode or regional level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, for the six major programmes listed under `Labour Market Programmes' (LMP's), data has been compiled by attributing LMP activity to specific postcodes relating to each electorate. Postcodes of the job seeker or provider which is attached to each payment are used to determine the location of the LMP activity. An LMP provider may have a business address postcode within, for example, Kalgoorlie, but may in fact be running projects outside the electorate. Conversely there may be providers conducting LMP projects within Kalgoorlie who have postcodes outside Kalgoorlie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Information on LMP activity has been grouped to reflect the changes in the programme structure which were introduced on 7 October 1996 in line with the recommendations of the Commonwealth Employment Service Advisory Committee (CESAC). The changes were designed to streamline programme administration, make programmes more flexible, provide a greater client focus and simplify the programme structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are also some types of LMP payments which simply cannot be categorised by postcode and therefore cannot be included in an LMP activity summary for the required electorates. These

With regard to 1996&hyphen;97, the information relates to expenditure for the year to 6 June 1997, with three weeks remaining in the financial year, for further payments to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For all other programmes listed, data have been obtained from the Department's Area Offices and National Programme Managers on expenditure in regions covering and crossing the electorates requested.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 30 April 1997</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Is it a fact that, as stated on page 91 of the Report Summary on the Long&hyphen;Term Operating Plan for Sydney Airport and Associated Airspace, that `All proposals for change in terminal area and air route arrangements in Australia are subject to environmental assessment in accordance with Airservices Australia's statutory obligations. These relate principally to two pieces of legislation, the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 (the Act) and the Air Services Act 1995'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Does the so&hyphen;called `environmental evaluation' discussed in the report at page 91 satisfy the Act requirements that all primary and secondary impacts, long&hyphen;term and short&hyphen;term, must be examined and taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Is it a fact that this so&hyphen;called `environmental evaluation'; (a) does little more than provide a comparison of the numbers of people who, at 1995 air traffic levels, would experience noise greater than 70 dB(A) under different operating modes; (b) falls far short of an assessment of the long&hyphen;term noise impacts; and (c) does not even pretend to address other environmental impacts such as air pollution and crash risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) (a) Is the Minister aware of the arguments for exempting earlier share&hyphen;the&hyphen;noise initiatives (reopening the east&hyphen;west runway, allowing northerly take&hyphen;offs from the third runway and abolishing the flight corridors) from the environmental assessment requirements of the Act, briefly: that there was an urgent need to share the aircraft noise because the Labor Government's concentration of overflights was causing some communities in Sydney to suffer grievous hardship and the need for immediate relief for those communities outweighed the public interest in having an environmental impact statement (EIS); (b) do these arguments apply in the case of the long&hyphen;term operating plan; and (c) are such arguments not valid for the long&hyphen;term operating plan because a redistribution of the noise has now partially taken place, for example the urgency has diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) (a) Will an EIS be undertaken into the long&hyphen;term operating plan; if not, why not; and (b) what alternatives will be employed.</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The sale of Auscript was announced in the 1997 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Corporatisation was one of the options considered by the review, but was not the recommended option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The review of the service considered the likely outcomes from a number of options. The decision to sell Auscript is based simply on the fact that Auscript provides services which the Government believes can and should be provided to clients by the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) As is standard sales practice, the estimated proceeds of the sale of Auscript have not been published as this would undermine the sales process.
