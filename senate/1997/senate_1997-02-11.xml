<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad the senator has recognised that Australian families do desperately need help. It was something which yesterday in question time I tried to make very clear: that during 13 years of Labor Australia's families have sunk further and further. Therefore, desperation at the way in which they had been treated caused many previously Labor voting families to vote for the coalition at the last election. But not only were they disenchanted with the previous government; they also recognised that the family tax initiative being promised by the coalition would go some way towards supporting them after all those years of neglect and all that harm to them. We have cut-out points for family income&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The senator is having difficulty hearing because of the interjections from her own side. Some opposition senators clearly do not want to hear the answer. This is a means tested payment to families with a parent at home. We have been very concerned to see that this payment is focused, and that has been widely recognised and welcomed by many community groups, who see the need to support families with a parent at home and basically only one income. That is why the program has been designed in the way that it has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some families will get their benefit through the tax system at the end of the financial year, but something like 900,000 families will get it through the social security system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, I take it that you are saying yes, 140,000 low income families will be denied the $9.60 a week. If you are trying to encourage women to stay at home and look after the children, why are you punishing so many of them by denying them the full benefit of the family tax initiative?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again obviously the opposition has finally come to the conclusion that they cannot go on knocking the family tax initiative and that they have to recognise it is desirable and useful. However, I dispute very strongly the suggestion which was implied in the supplementary question that the government is in any way trying to send women home. The whole purpose of assistance for families is to recognise that families want to make choices. At different stages of their lives they all want different outcomes. Many families who have an under five in the family want one parent to be able to stay at home. Those who choose differently are also assisted through the tax system by way of two tax thresholds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is about choice for women and supporting families. We are proud of it, and no matter how much cackle comes from the opposition it is one of the reasons that this government was elected.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2M6">Senator COONAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, and it concerns Australia's young people. Minister, youth unemployment under the previous Labor government reached an all-time high of 34.8 per cent. Will you inform the Senate of the initiatives the Howard government is taking in relation to enhancing job opportunities for Australia's youth?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="434" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am very pleased to do so because the Howard coalition government is facing up to the legacy of Labor in this vitally important area. You are right, Senator Coonan; in fact it was June 1992 that youth unemployment reached a record high of 34.8 per cent under Labor. Labor's record: 34.8 per cent youth unemployment. Who was the employment minister at the time? None other than Mr Beazley. Mr Beazley, now Leader of the Opposition, was employment minister of this country when youth unemployment reached 34.8 per cent, Labor's record; 131,700 young people out of work, Labor's record; the highest level of youth unemployment since the Great Depression, Labor's record. As the Howard government tackles the task it inherited from Labor&mdash;that of mass unemployment of young Austral 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ians&mdash;let it never be forgotten that what it is tackling is Labor's legacy: mass unemployment of young Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, we do not apologise for the fact that we are going to try some new ideas, because Labor failed. We had 13 years of Labor's ideas and they left mass unemployment of young Australians. So we will try new ideas. We will try the work for the dole idea&mdash;an idea that is going to give some young Australians hope; a chance that will give them meaningful work experience; a chance to assist some to break out of the cycle of unproductive activity and isolation that some are experiencing. We do not apologise for that. We are confident it will work and it is good that there is a government that is prepared to try to implement some new ideas to tackle this ingrained unemployment that we have inherited from Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is not just that scheme. In just 10 months of government what do we have? We have $200 million to be invested over four years in the modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system. We are rejigging the apprenticeship system of this country to give young Australians a better chance of adequate training and a better chance of a job. New traineeships in five key rural industries for up to 1,000 young Australians will begin next month. That is good news for young Australians that were left unemployed by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have $41.6 million over three years in the green corps, a good initiative by the Howard government&mdash;knocked by Labor, of course, but all they can do these days is just knock; they have no new ideas. That will give 3,500 young Australians experience in the field, environmental experience and work experience. Surprise, surprise, young Australians in their thousands are applying to be part of that scheme. Labor was not interested in it, but thousands of young Australians say they want to be part of it, which demonstrates what young Australians think of Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember, Madam President, that there are the new measures to assist schools to better prepare young people for the work force. We have the national schools early literacy strategy, because we recognise that failing to gain literacy skills at an early age puts young 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="435"> people at a disadvantage for all their working life. The Howard government is tackling it. The jobs pathways guarantee will take young people from year 12 directly into jobs and give them a better chance therefore to be able to build a career that is worth while and to give them hope. Four thousand scholarships will be given to the disadvantaged&mdash;I could go on for half an hour. This is good news for young Australians; something that they did not get from Labor. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

They are not going to climb out of this because I am going to have much pleasure reminding the Australian taxpayers about this right up until the next election.

You could argue a variety of places that a work for the dole scheme might go. You might say that social security should look after it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have delivered the CGT relief, reduced provisional tax&mdash;which has been of great benefit to small business&mdash;reduced the paperwork burden on small business and generally provided an appropriate environment for the growth of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Business has already benefited from lower interest rates. Rates for small business have gone down the full amount of cuts in official rates. Average rates have fallen from 11&frac14; per cent when Labor was thrown out of government down to 9.75 per cent today. For a small business with a loan of some $500,000, this provides an interest benefit&mdash;a reduction of $7,500 a year or about $140 a week. This clearly is a major boost to small business and helps in our aim of creating the right environment to create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government strongly welcomes signs of increased business loan competition. We have all seen and indeed welcome the big benefits that home owners have enjoyed from strong competition in the home lending market. Aussie Home Loans, the biggest non&hyphen;bank lender, has just entered the business loan market and many senators would have seen the news last night. It claims that this move will help revolutionise small business lending. They have announced that they will be offering business loans at the standard variable rate of 7.49 per cent, which is, I understand, 2&frac14; percentage points below the average rate of the big four banks. Again, this will translate through to very, very big savings for small business.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. The shadow minister for employment has recently proposed job sharing as a way of tackling Australia's unemployment problem. Have you seen the comments last week by Mr Doug Cameron, the National Secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, that job sharing really means poverty sharing? How is the government tackling the problem of unemployment?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Abetz. The government has a very broad ranging plan to address the problem of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment. Government initiatives include the expanded traineeship and apprenticeship opportunities, improved skills learnt by young Australians in school, the green corps, as Senator Hill has mentioned this morning, and work for the dole. Labor, on the other hand, the former government, has no plan for unemployment&mdash;no plan to fix the mess that you created.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comments of Doug Cameron, the National Secretary of the Australian Manufac 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="444"> turing Workers Union, that job sharing is poverty sharing show how very silly Martin Ferguson's suggestions are. He cannot even get the support of his union mates in this matter. Job sharing will in fact lower workers' take-home pay and it will increase business costs. Labor in government increased taxes and now what they apparently want to do is cut wages. That is what your employment spokesperson suggests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Job sharing is likely to reduce total employment. A recent report from the Brotherhood of St Laurence said that job sharing is not the answer to Australia's unemployment problem. Access Economics said recently that, since a lot of overtime was unpaid and a lot of it was worked by small business owners, job sharing was simply not practicable. Furthermore, the OECD described job sharing in its 1994 employment outlook as `what not to do'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has no solution to the unemployment problem that they left this government with. It created the highest level of unemployment since the Second World War and had 32 consecutive months of unemployment greater than 10 per cent. Having created high unemployment they say that the answer is not to create more jobs but to share the existing ones around by therefore cutting pay and conditions. That is how creative these people are. We have the green corps, work for the dole and all the other things I mentioned and all you can do is share the jobs around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real irony of this proposal is that Labor rejected job sharing when it formulated Working Nation. But now you allow your spokesman to come around trying to flog it off. In Labor's green paper on employment they stated that job sharing leads to a poorer long&hyphen;term employment result. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An examination of international evidence of a variety of work sharing measures found that work time reductions probably led to declines in employment and Australian research found no substantial evidence to suggest that reductions in working time have had beneficial consequences for employment levels.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Our plan is to encourage job creating business investment through a balanced budget, low inflation and low interest rates, to assist 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> young Australians through giving them skills and to assist small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line is that we can ask ourselves: did Labor's Working Nation reject job sharing? Yes, it did. Did the AMWU describe job sharing as poverty sharing? Yes, they did. Did the OECD say that job sharing is one of the things not to do? Yes, they did. Did the Brotherhood of St Laurence say that many workers could not afford lost income? Yes, they did. Did the National Institute of Labour Studies say that there was no evidence that job sharing increases employment? Yes, they did.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry; I haven't orchestrated anything on this one. I am not sure the reference to cast&hyphen;iron, gilt&hyphen;edged guarantees was in relation to Radio Australia. If there was a report to that effect in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> , I detect an inaccuracy in a report of what was said. Let me explain the circumstances in relation to Radio Australia so that there is no doubt about where we stand on the issue. When we nominated a saving of $55 million for the 1997&hyphen;98 budget, it was then incumbent upon the ABC to effectively find that $55 million. Over the last six months or so, they have set about that task very diligently. On about 6 December last year, they announced that the one ABC policy would save $27 million. They have since identified Radio Australia as a service which could save an additional $20.5 million being $13.5 million for the service itself and another $7 million for the transmission costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, it is a decision for the ABC. Obviously, we will be having discussions with them in the lead&hyphen;up to the budget to determine what approach is ulti 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="445"> mately taken in relation to the ABC. We have not prejudged the issue but my strong view is that, if the service were to close down, or substantially close down, it would not be fair on the ABC if they were then not able to retain the proceeds, because that is what Mansfield recommended as a way of enabling them to meet the $55 million. They have gone through that exercise in good faith and it does seem to me that that is an appropriate way of solving the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are broader issues involved and we are still looking at the whole question of Radio Australia's future, but Mansfield makes it plain, and it makes a lot of sense to me, that, if you do forgo $20.5 million, you ought to be able to count that towards your $55 million.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), to a question without notice asked by Senator Faulkner today, relating to youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Vanstone has copped a huge humiliation over the past 48 hours. We have the situation where, in relation to the nation's employment, education, training and youth affairs, she has been gazumped by her junior, Dr Kemp. Of course, it was all outlined for us in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald Sun</EMPHASIS>  today. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The very fact that Dr Kemp is now to assume a high&hyphen;profile role indicates . . . the government must bring a more imaginative and proactive approach to the employment debate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not think anyone on this side of the chamber would argue that this government needs a more proactive, imaginative approach. But we would argue with the suggestion that Dr Kemp is going to provide it. This is the same Dr Kemp who, on ABC Radio's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS>  program on 10 February, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, Sharon, we've never ruled out a compulsory work for the dole scheme. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, Sharon, we've never ruled out a compulsory work for the dole scheme.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Oh, really, Dr Kemp! That is most interesting because on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS>  program on Sunday, 3 September 1995 the same Dr David Kemp, the one that is after Amanda Vanstone's job, in answer to a question from Christine Wallace, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no thought at all, Chris, of making any kind of work&hyphen;for&hyphen;the&hyphen;dole scheme a compulsory scheme.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the same Dr Kemp who has been given responsibility for a scheme that he did not support. Of course, everyone on this side of the chamber knows that this scheme is nothing more or less than a smokescreen, pulled out of Mr Howard's back pocket to try to cover up his problems with ministerial accountability and competence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He thought that he had better do something to cover up the problems that he has, particularly his problems with memory lapses which seem to have become a real pattern with this Prime Minister. Memory lapses are, I am afraid, just a way of political life for Mr John Howard. Today, before question time even started in the House of Representatives, Mr Howard had to admit to a Liberal Party response to an election questionnaire. The Liberal Party, in Mr Howard's name, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not support the introduction of a work for the dole scheme.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Thank you, Mr Howard. What then did Mr Howard&mdash;our Prime Minister with such a weak memory; this very forgetful Prime Minister&mdash;go on to say? He just said that he had never seen the questionnaire, that the Liberal Party had responded and their response, therefore, was not attributable to him. `It is the Liberal Party's fault, not mine,' said Mr Howard. I do not think any fair-minded person will accept that sort of miserable excuse from a Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this chamber we are faced with an employment minister who, it has been proved, is not only no longer responsible for schools, training or vocational education, but is also 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="446"> now not responsible for either youth policy or employment policy. This is an extraordinary situation. Even the statement of the employment minister, that any government that does not get unemployment down does not deserve to be re-elected, was repudiated by Mr Howard on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> a couple of nights ago. Senator Vanstone has been counted out of this work for the dole scheme because she has no credibility in her own portfolio, her own party or her own government&mdash;nor has she in the eyes of her leader or her colleagues. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The very real simple answer to all this is that the Labor Party have been gazumped and humiliated by our policy initiative of work for the dole that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has announced. The Labor Party have been left absolutely flat footed in relation to policy development in this area. They have been gazumped.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got a good policy. The Labor Party know it is supported within the community, so what is their method of attack? To suggest that it has been given to one minister as opposed to another minister to try to deflect attention from the very good policy initiative that has been so overwhelmingly supported by the Australian people. You people that actually do listen to your electorates from time to time must have got the phone calls into your offices to say what a good initiative it is and how much it ought be supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought it somewhat strange that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) should talk about the humiliation of Senator Vanstone. In fact, Senator Vanstone is doing a very good job. If anybody was humiliated during their ministerial career, was it not Senator Faulkner when he was unable to resolve the woodchip issue with Mr Beddall? Remember that fiasco? It was taken completely away from Senator Faulkner. Now that the heat is getting too much, he is walking out of the chamber. That was the sort of strength he displayed on the woodchip issue as well. When it got too  tough, it all had to be handed over to the then Prime Minister to handle.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So don't come the line of humiliation. If there is humiliation in this chamber, we witness it each and every day when Senator Robert Ray trots down from the back row, whispers into Senator Faulkner's ear and tells him what to do, what question to ask and what tactic to employ. If there was a display of humiliation in this chamber, I would have thought it was fair and square just down there in front of where Senator Bob Collins sits&mdash;in the chair of Senator Faulkner. That is where all the humiliation is. We on this side do feel sorry for Senator Faulkner, but we are not really going to assist him in relation to that. We will continue to watch the demise of the Labor Party, who are squabbling amongst themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, if there is another example of humiliation for the opposition leader in the Senate, it is the branch stacking that is occurring in his own home state that we could read about in the papers just in recent times. There are elements within the Labor Party who are stacking out the branches to get rid of the likes of Senator John Faulkner. So he has trouble from his own former Prime Minister, he has trouble with his own state division and he has the audacity to come in here to try to make allegations against us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clear fact is that the work for the dole scheme, which will be under the administration of Dr David Kemp, has been overwhelmingly supported by the Australian people. They see it as being of real benefit to young people. We have the mindless interjections from the opposition talking about chain gangs. Who on earth is talking about chain gangs? What did your shadow minister for employment say about these young people who congregate in certain areas in our cities and towns and what did he say about the sort of anti-social activity that he alleges, in a very patronising way, they get up to? Instead of putting them down, instead of stereotyping them, instead of making allegations that they engage in petty criminal activity, we are actually coming up with a solution which you could not find after 13 years of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With youth unemployment at 34.8 per cent, you have the audacity to hector and lecture us as to how to overcome the problem! The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="447"> Australian people do not believe you. You have to do better than that. Come up with sound policy alternatives&mdash;policy alternatives that the Labor Party will actually agree with, not these sorts of half-baked schemes that your shadow minister came out with on radio the other day only to be repudiated by the people who endorse you, your own trade union movement. The situation is very simple. The people of Australia fully support the scheme as announced by the Prime Minister and I look forward to its overwhelming success.</PARA></SPEECH>

My office did not make calls, but this indicates what she does when there is a poll on. She gets all the people in her office to ring up and use the phone. She has actually been condemned from her own mouth because that indicates what she does with polls. And that is why the people on the other side are trying to create a diversion and are trying to distract people about who has got the job because that is the sort of evidence that is coming into their offices, that is what they are hearing on the talkback programs: that people want a system that gives young people some sort of sense of worth and some sort of opportunity to do something, and many of the young people themselves are saying that the policy has got merit. We have got a system where we are going to be looking at the work for the dole scheme in rural and regional areas and pilot schemes are being put in place. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to take note of the answer that Senator Vanstone gave. I think some of the answers we have had from two ministers today are amazing and quite intriguing. We have had a so&hyphen;called list of the initiatives that have been put forward to solve unemployment, specifically youth unemployment in this country. I find it staggering that Ministers Vanstone and Hill have told this chamber today&mdash;as of course did Senator Patterson just then&mdash;that the ALP was responsible for the highest level of youth unemployment, that it reached 34 per cent. But the fact seems to have escaped them that youth unemployment in this country is the highest it has been in 2&half; years right now&mdash;30.4 per cent of 15 to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds are looking for work; 99,900 young Australians are looking for full&hyphen;time work in this nation and cannot find it. Okay, so the ALP might get first prize but unfortunately the government comes in a very close second and a staggeringly high, embarrassingly close second at that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="450">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I have heard a stream of initiatives put forward by ministers and by backbenchers and yet once again I have heard no mention of the issue of real jobs. I still do not believe that this scheme has overwhelming support in the community. In fact, a cursory glance at today's newspapers and even the television coverage last night made it clear that people were divided over this scheme. What middle Australia wants&mdash;and the coalition is so keen on discussing middle Australia&mdash;and what the mums and dads of Australia and what their sons and daughters keep telling the Australian Democrats&mdash;and, I have no doubt, other senators&mdash;is that they do not want stop&hyphen;gap, short&hyphen;term measures but an investment in real jobs in our society. Not once have I heard a minister or anyone else on the government side refer to future jobs, sustainable jobs, meaningful jobs for young Australians. Instead, yet again, in the media and on the news last night and in this chamber today and no doubt in the other place, we have heard all the stereotypes that could possibly be applied to young Australians being continually applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am staggered that there could be a DEETYA&hyphen;sponsored ACOSS report demonstrating that compulsion for young people, when it comes to a work for the dole scheme, does not work. Compulsion does not lead to a work ethic. Compulsion does not lead to increased self&hyphen;esteem or morale and yet this government keeps glossing over that with this notion that somehow young people need to be compelled to work because young people are somehow reluctant to work because young people are lazy or are sitting around at home. In fact, 99,000 young Australians are not reluctant to work. They are looking for work but they cannot find it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say through you, Mr Deputy President, that we had Senator Abetz use the word `mindless.' I will tell you what is `mindless'. It is when a minister for employment in this place stands up and rules out completely the notion of job sharing. That notion has been completely ruled out by this minister and I look forward to hearing her comments during the rest of this week because doesn't that show how simplistic and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> how bereft of notions and ideas this government is when it comes to solving the employment crisis in this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What they do not seem to understand is that we have a crisis. We have an urban, a regional, a rural and a remote crisis when it comes to youth unemployment but we also have a radically changed work force. We have a work force that has changed structurally and technologically. In fact, the entry&hyphen;level jobs that young people used to hold have disappeared and not once have I heard the minister responsible, or any of her colleagues, address the issue of unemployment and how we are actually going to create jobs.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> undermine the senior minister and to promote the ambitions of the junior minister in her portfolio. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS>  of Tuesday, 11 February we again saw a quite detailed presentation of Minister Kemp's claim to the senior position within the portfolio. He says that he is the understudy to the employment, education and training and youth affairs minister, who has, in fact, the cabinet position. Mr Tony Parkinson clearly backgrounded Minister Kemp's situation and he says that it is quite absurd. It is quite clear what the intention is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A similar sort of position was put in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, which stated that the government:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Is that what we call a moderate in the Liberal Party these days?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for the government to accept that: "Respect for the democratic principles and basic human rights, as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, underpins the internal and international policies of . . . Australia" and to agree to the inclusion of that form of words in any trade agreement with the European Community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I must say I am surprised that the terms of this urgency motion have come to the attention of the Australian public in general, the European public in general and especially this parliament. The fact that Australia is not prepared to sign a treaty&mdash;whether it be about trade, human rights, hot air balloons landing in Australia, defence, economics or anything at all&mdash;with human rights clauses in it is absolutely extraordinary. The people whom I have spoken to in Europe about this&mdash;indeed anyone I have spoken to around the world, including Australia&mdash;also find it absolutely extraordinary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The level of a nation's commitment to human rights, whether in domestic practices or in foreign policy, is the litmus test for the quality of its democracy. Respect for human rights cannot be separated from any other aspect of government policy. On 10 December last year, both the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and I addressed the National Press Club on this issue. He stated:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="457">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government views human rights as an inseparable part of Australia's overall foreign policy approach.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Why then did that minister, in a letter to the Vice President of the European Commission, write:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have to say that the existence of operative human rights and non-fulfilment provisions as proposed by the Community remains in our view inappropriate in an agreement on trade and co&hyphen;operation . . . between Australia and the European Community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The least you can say about that position is that it is thoroughly inconsistent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's position on this raises some very serious questions about the strength and the sincerity of Australia's declared commitment to indivisible human rights. It also raises questions about whether international trade and human rights can and ought to be totally separate. The Democrats do not think they can, nor should they be. Each and every international treaty that we sign ought to contain a reference to upholding the universal declaration of human rights. That is the absolute building block of the basic rights of every single person who belongs to every single one of the 185 nations that make up the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, the government's position on the trade treaty is being strongly backed by groups such as the Business Council of Australia, but it is of concern to those organisations whose primary focus is on maintaining basic human rights standards&mdash;organisations such as Community Aid Abroad, the Australian Council for Overseas Aid, the ACTU and many more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trade outcomes and objectives statement of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Fischer) of 5 February this year clearly places Asia at the centre of his strategy. He states that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we are unique in being a developed country with a strong comparative advantage in the rural and mining industries . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not think anyone would disagree with that. But if we are at such an advantage in a trade sense, then why not in a human rights capacity as well? One also has to ask, is this furious campaign to engage with Asia in a trade sense actually our trade reality?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The European Union is of great importance to Australia. For example, the European Union is Australia's largest economic partner; larger than Japan when you take into consideration merchandise trade, trade in services, financial transfers and direct foreign investment. I cannot understand the government's position under article 32 of the treaty that gives `any European country the option of walking away from its obligations under the agreement on the basis of undefined human rights criteria'. Those human rights criteria are very well spelt out. They are human rights criteria contained within the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights. As Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jose Ramos Horta stated recently, `Human rights are not a Western concept; they are a human concept.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the two articles in the proposed European Union framework to which Australia objects. They are article 1, which declares respect for universal human rights as an essential element of the agreement&mdash;and I cannot see a problem with that&mdash;and article 32, which allows either party to withdraw from the agreement after lengthy and complicated examination, consultation and negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Article 32 is referred to as the non-fulfilment clause. It allows either party to withdraw from the treaty in instances where the other party has failed to fulfil an obligation under the agreement. As I have just said, withdrawal is not automatic. Except in circumstances of  special urgency, the parties seeking to withdraw from the agreement must supply the other with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a solution which is acceptable to both parties. After all&mdash;and this makes complete sense&mdash;maintenance of the treaty is the paramount consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what could possibly be the problem? If the government is concerned about the way in which Australia adheres to its international and domestic human rights obligations, then they ought to fix the matter about which they are concerned. But that does not seem to be such an easy proposition. The Deputy Prime Minister has made no secret of the way in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="458"> which he, as trade minister, feels about human rights. He has indicated that Australia would not allow any reservations over China's human rights record to influence this government's attitude to trade with that country. He has said, `We do not have the capacity of being the world's policing authority or the world's conscience on human rights.' What a very offensive thing to say, but he has said it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But he did not stop there. He has played down China's brutal occupation of Tibet, and he has rejected trade sanctions against Burma over its appalling human rights record. Based on this record alone, why should the Australian community place any importance in the government upholding human rights in their trade partnerships?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The European trade treaty human rights clause is not the only human rights forum in which the government is seeking to wind back Australia's involvement. Since coming into government, the coalition has been very keen to distance Australia from international forums. We are disturbed by this transition. We believe we must never accept the idea that the internationalisation of the economy forces us to accept lower industrial standards. On the contrary, the internationalisation of the economy is the strongest argument for the internationalisation of labour rights and industrial standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a sound reputation in that area. Australia was a foundation member of the International Labour Organisation nearly 80 years ago. We have made a contribution to the ILO which is well in excess of our size as an economic power. We have developed a strong reputation as a defender of human rights and labour rights throughout the world. And an essential element of our ability to raise questions about human rights in other countries is our credibility. As the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, said on 6 February this year, `Australia's commitment to human rights is unequivocal and our record is second to none.' I certainly hope that is still the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we cannot rest there. We must continue to practise what we preach. Australia cannot allow an ideological perspective on the value of the ILO, for instance, to cloud the import 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ance of ratifying treaties and conventions which exist to protect the human rights of our overseas counterparts as well as our own population. In the words of Gough Whitlam:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . State indifference or intransigence are no longer excuses for our national failure to meet our international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A trend is emerging of international withdrawal and irresponsibility within this government and, indeed, around the world. At all times this government should be seeking to meet the grade of international best practice in absolutely everything that we do. We cannot expect to even come close by not signing the human rights clause in the EU trade treaty. If we are to remain a respected player in international human rights forums, we have to practise what we preach. The Prime Minister is right when he said that. But neither he nor his cabinet ministers are acting in accordance with that commitment to anywhere near the extent that we would like to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Withdrawal from the ILO is merely one United Nations forum from which this government has retreated. Australia has reduced its expenditure on UNICEF, the world population fund, UNDP, UNRWA, UNEP, the Global Environment Facility and the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund, and the reproductive health program in the WHO. Contributions to the UNHCR, the International Red Cross and emergency aid have also been reduced. The government also has announced its withdrawal from the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation. It has cut back on grants to a number of community based organisations, including the United Nations Association of Australia. Most of this has been done without consultation. So where is the commitment to human rights in that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government maintains that human rights and labour standards are the province of such United Nations organisations. But with withdrawals and cutbacks in funding, including our own, this government can easily wipe its hands of any further need to provide for them in negotiations for trade. That all seems so very tidy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="459">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us make no mistake about this. In this so-called new era of globalisation, countries will rely more and more upon international law and agreement to develop common responses to global issues. In that sort of climate, generating a positive public response to treaties becomes increasingly important. We have to convince our fellow Australians that we cannot pull up this drawbridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many problems in this world today, and they can only be solved by governments cooperating to set national and international standards and international rules. This government is now fighting very hard to ensure that human rights are not linked to trade when, in fact, as we all know, human rights are linked to everything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What all this adds up to is that Australia is going backwards on basic human rights. I believe that more than a decade's worth of economic rationalism has a lot to do with that, and it has led to the point where we are in danger of instilling in Australians a sense that human rights are not important, that they can and should be downgrade and traded off in pursuit of more important economic goals. If we do not halt that trend, we will never become a tolerant, mature or civilised society, and we will never be able to influence or to improve human rights either here in Australia or anywhere else in the world.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about our own? This matter has been substantially on foot since April last year when this government came to office, and it remains unresolved after almost a year. While the issue of the framework agreement had its embryonic 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> discussions during our period of office, the substantive period has been during your period. Also, the delay in signing it and the reason offered for that delay&mdash;the objection you have raised to the human rights provision&mdash;is yours alone and not ours, and it is therefore on your head. I am now saying, on behalf of the opposition: we urge you to sign it. You can resolve this problem immediately by taking my advice and doing so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 10 February the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) put out a press release headed `Minister urges more business interest in Europe'. Quite rightly, the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian companies have not focused enough on Europe. It is a huge market. While there is a lot of potential in Asia, our country should also look to Europe for business opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is from Mr Prosser, as I have said, on 10 February. That is a very sensible comment. Any effort to improve our trade relationship with Europe should be seized because it is a major economy in the world and it is a major trading market. Importantly, Australian manufactured goods that succeed in that market tend to succeed wherever, because this is a high profile market, a discerning market and one that puts a premium on quality, price and competitiveness. If you succeed there, you virtually get into other markets elsewhere in the world also. It is a prime target for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is a sensible comment also because, on 3 June last year, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and the Minister for Foreign Affairs released a study&mdash;a study which, I might say, was commenced by us when we were in office. The report was concluded shortly after the election and handed to the incoming ministers. They released this report, the heading of which is `Australia and European Union Trade and Investment Towards 2000'. That trade analysed the trade and investment potential of our relationship with Europe and came to a number of conclusions about how important that was, how fundamental to the growth of this economy it is and why we should do everything in our power to improve it. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="460">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, interestingly, in the joint media release of the ministers, they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Extraordinary growth in Australian investment in Europe, strong European investment growth in Australia and a good performance by Australia's exporters of manufactured products and services are highlights of the Australia&hyphen;European Union trade and investment relationship in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is how they began their press release. That is an achievement of the former Labor government. They were announcing this based on analysis done before they came into office. Nonetheless, it serves to underline the point that, while there has been good growth in the past, further growth can be expected in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They then went on and said that there were a number of things that could be done. If one looks at the attachment to their press release, they however make an important point&mdash;an important point that should not be forgotten. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The growing bilateral trade deficit is a source of concern however. The study questions whether such growth in the deficit will be sustainable and identifies a number of challenges for Australian government and business and for the European Union to ensure continuing trade growth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, they were pointing out what most of us who have ever thought about this relationship know: firstly, that Europe is a major and historic trading partner for Australia; secondly, that Europe is the major source of most foreign investment in Australia; thirdly, the pattern of trade between us is the sorry old pattern of us selling minerals and agricultural commodities in the main but now and under the period of Labor in office increasingly manufactured goods and services as well but still with the emphasis on minerals and agriculture, and of them on their side selling us high technology, high quality manufactured products and services as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the quality of the relationship goes to their side of it; the volume of the relationship goes to our side of it. Anything that can be done to improve the inroads into the European market of Australian manufacturers would be welcome. Indeed, Mitsubishi Australia is a manufacturer of motor vehicles there now. A number of Australian component part manufacturers have sold components 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to BMW and Mercedes Benz. Ticketing outlets at airports and at transport systems are increasingly using Western Australian technology. The Swiss stock exchange is automated on Australian technology and so on. We have a beachhead here, but much more needs to be done about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important thing is that we have a trade deficit of about $11 billion with Europe. We sell them nearly $8 billion worth of goods and services annually, and we import from them $19&half; billion worth of goods and services, leaving a deficit on our side of the margin of about $11.4 billion worth of goods and services. Four billion dollars of that is with Germany alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that overall the Australian economy suffers badly because of the level of our current account deficit, which is a level of about four per cent of GDP. If we compare that with other European countries, many of them have far better current account deficits than we do. The only way we can repair the current account deficit is to become more competitive as a nation and to sell more goods or to replace more imports than we currently do and to add value to primary products that we export out of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> However, there is a positive step that can be taken which will help Australian exporters, and that would be for this country to sign the negotiated European Union trade and cooperation framework agreement. This debate is really about why this government is dillydallying in signing&mdash;the sole reason why it refuses to open the door to this agreement and allow the Australian exporters to take a bigger share of the European market and repair some of the current account and adverse trading balance figures that we have with Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sole reason that this government advances is that the proposal put by the Europeans contains a human rights clause. From our side of politics it is worth asking: is that sufficient reason to block the economic advantages and the jobs for Australians that will flow from them in the case of this agreement? It seems to me and to my party that the answer is: absolutely not. The reason why we conclude that is that, of course, this is more than 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="461"> simply a trade agreement. It is a trade and cooperation framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising that not just trade matters appear in the agreement&mdash;other matters appear in it as well. If this were a straight and narrow trade agreement, one could be rightfully suspicious of the introduction of extraneous clauses. It is broader than that because, in a straight trade agreement, the only reason to put in an extraneous clause is to try to somehow interfere with the trade issues by introducing side matters. That is not the case here. It is a trade and cooperation agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what does this agreement ask us to do as a nation? It asks us to sign on to the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights as being the determinant of human rights values between the European Union and Australia. That is a very unexceptionable request. Australia is already bound to observe the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We are bound because we have signed onto it within the United Nations. If the Europeans invite us to sign onto it between us and them, what is surprising about that? It is a consistency of behaviour because we have affirmed those standards to the world, not just to that regional grouping in Europe. So the request itself is unsurprising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is saying that we are not going to sign that. He gives us his reason that `any European country can exercise the option of walking away from its obligations under the agreement on the basis of undefined human rights criteria'. That explanation does not wash. It does not wash because it does not stack up when logic is applied to it. Firstly, what does he mean by `undefined human rights criteria'? The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the centrepiece in the world for global human rights standards.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MacGIBBON" NAMEID="YH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGibbon</NAME></TALKER>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And we are a signatory to it. So what is wrong with signing it twice&mdash;at a regional level as well as at a global level? You cannot say, however&mdash;as the Prime Minister imputes in his rejection of it&mdash;that it contains `undefined human rights 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> criteria'. This is a document under the microscope worldwide, and its criteria are set out therein. It is not `undefined'; there are criteria in the universal declaration itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, can countries unilaterally walk away from it? That would be true if article Y were not in the European proposal for signature for Australia. Article Y in the proposed framework agreement is headed `Article Y on non-fulfilment'. That is to say, if a nation does not fulfil its obligations under this agreement, what then occurs? If one reads article Y, which is a very simple article, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If either Party considers that the other Party has failed to fulfil any of its obligations under this Agreement, it may take appropriate measures. Before so doing&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and then it makes an exception about urgency, which is dealt with later and appropriately, I might say&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it shall supply the Association/Cooperation Council with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Parties.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So if there were an objection about Australia's human rights record by a European, they are required to enter into a process to say what that objection is, to have the matter investigated and examined, to participate in a procedure which would bring about a resolution between the two nations&mdash;or the two groups of nations in the case of Europe and Australia&mdash;and to try to work at solving the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extraordinary defensiveness of the Prime Minister's position is alarming. It may be that he fears that there are some human rights infractions in Australia that Europeans might object to. If there are, let them say so, and let us have the debate out. This is an important consideration here, because this human rights clause is a two-way street. It is not just for Europeans to operate on Australia but it is, as well, for Australians to operate on Europe. If people have been to Europe and seen the treatment of minorities&mdash;of Arabs in France, of Africans in France and Germany, of gipsies everywhere and of eastern Europeans, where poverty is striking people in the former Soviet Union, who are coming across 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="462"> and trying to find jobs in the more developed and affluent West&mdash;they would have seen the prospect of considerable concern about human rights. They are prospects and concerns that Europeans themselves raise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We only have to watch on our television screens the scenes of neo&hyphen;Nazi mobs in Germany last year burning down buildings because of protests they were conducting to raise again substantial questions on the European side about human rights. In this case, if there was a major infraction in Europe would Australia sit on its hands? It has an avenue under this agreement to raise those questions and they are important options for us too. It is not&mdash;and this is a very relevant consideration&mdash;a one&hyphen;way street; it is a two&hyphen;way street that we can operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, one always needs to be careful in international agreements about whether they can be capriciously used. As someone who has negotiated on behalf of this nation on matters of trade with the Europeans, I know that one has to be very careful in their case. I know that some of the stories that circulate in France about Australian agriculture are totally unrepresentative. I would say too that some of the actions of French legislators about Australia in order to try to prevent Australian goods which are competitive entering their market are without conscience and totally unfair practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The prospect of a nation misbehaving itself or the possibility of that is something to be guarded against. However, the question is: do you guard against it by simply refusing to be part of an agreement which opens the door to further trade opportunities? This is with not just one nation, but with a group of nations&mdash;the whole of the European Union. If there is one nation, they need to get their complaint up, registered and accepted by the rest of them before they proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there are sufficient safeguards here so that Australia can say that as a nation in the world our proud record on human rights can be exemplified in this agreement if we sign it. In the past we have been a nation&mdash;and I hope we can continue to be in the future&mdash;that goes around the world telling other countries when we think that they have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> broken human rights standards. We told the Chinese when they put that Australian businessman in gaol and we criticised them about Tiananmen Square. We raised questions about East Timor. We put our nose in on human rights unapologetically everywhere.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are many surprises in politics, but this is not one of them. It was entirely predictable for the Democrats to move this motion before the Senate today. In simple terms, this motion seeks to attack the human rights records and achievements of Liberal governments, and that is a ludicrous proposition. It simply does not accord with historical fact. We have this from a party which supported Saddam Hussein in the run&hyphen;up to the Gulf War when he was poisoning his own people, the Kurds. Some human rights record that party has!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising, because the Democrats have no scholarship at all. Their modus operandi for the 18 years that they have been in this parliament has been one of complete superficiality in relation both to issues and to policies. It is completely ingrained into their character. It is a consequence of their populist approach to everything. As the former senator Peter Walsh said so lucidly and accurately, they are the meretricious players on the political stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The record of Australia on the international stage in the field of human rights is second to no other country. That is largely the achievement of Liberal governments and their predecessors, because they have formed the majority of governments in Australia this century. Let us have a look briefly at the achievements of Liberal governments since the Second World War. One of the great elevating instruments for human rights in the Asia Pacific region was the Colombo plan which was introduced by the Liberal government in 1950. It was the first serious program to address economic cooperation and technology transfer and led to tangible benefits in basic social and political rights in the form of education and health.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="463">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dick Casey&mdash;after whom the foreign affairs building just over the road is named&mdash;was one of the great foreign ministers for this country and he further developed the Colombo plan. Most importantly, he took the battle for human rights into the United Nations. In those forums he established the credentials of Australia as a great protector of human rights around the world&mdash;a fearless defender of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most recently, of course, we had the great effort by the Fraser government against the apartheid regime in South Africa. No nation made a greater contribution to overcoming that regime than did the Liberal government in the late 1970s and early 1980s. We know that that noxious regime has now gone into history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the motion itself, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for the Government to accept that: "Respect for democratic principles and basic human rights, as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, underpins the internal and international policies . . . of Australia" and to agree to the inclusion of that form of words in any trade agreement with the European community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In plain language what that motion is saying is that this government is not committed wholeheartedly to human rights. I have just shown that that is not true. There is a second implication carried in that motion and that is that there will be dire consequences for our trade in the form of that trade being cut off if we do not sign the agreement. That also is not true. It is surprising that Senator Cook, who preceded me, did not understand that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the brief time I have I want to examine three points in relation to this motion: firstly, the trade agreement itself; secondly, where we are with the negotiations; and thirdly, the consequences if agreement is not reached. The first point to be made is that there is not one document; there are two documents in this package. There is a framework trade and cooperation agreement and, secondly, there is a joint political declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's position is that human rights matters are properly a concern of the joint political declaration, not of the trade agreement. Australia has proposed that the human 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rights concerns be addressed in the joint political declaration. I must say that, as someone with an interest in foreign affairs, I cannot understand how the European Commission did not come to that conclusion initially of their own volition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the reason for this. It has been Australian policy for years to separate security matters from trade. We have never argued in this parliament that, when the Americans did nasty things to us in the form of their farm enhancement programs, their agricultural subsidies or any of the non&hyphen;tariff trade barriers they have applied to our goods, we would link that to our security agreement with ANZUS. We have always seen these two concerns as quite separate. In the same vein, we have always seen human rights issues as separate from trade issues. It was also the policy of the Labor Party. It is very interesting that, in government, the Labor Party initiated the position that today's government is supporting in Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I saw a press release today from the shadow minister for trade. He tells me in that press release that the Labor government, if they were in government&mdash;which they are not&mdash;would be prepared to sign the agreement. It is quite apparent that Mr Smith is part and parcel of the same revisionist camp that we have seen in the Labor Party rewriting Australian history for the last 10 or 13 years. The point is that the position of the Labor Party in government in November 1995 was to support the same position as we do today. That was a government which included the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), Mr Brereton, Mr Evans and the same Mr Smith. Could anyone in the Labor Party tell us when, where and why the policy changed? I will tell you why it changed. It changed because, like the Democrats, it became opportunistically advantageous for you to change it overnight when you saw that we were getting some criticism in the press for defending a matter of principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go on to what the position is at the present time. The position at the present time is that negotiations are proceeding amicably and in good faith. We will take this agreement to a satisfactory conclusion&mdash;a conclu 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="464"> sion which will be mutually acceptable both to Australia and to the European Commission. These things may take time. I remember the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1983. It took the EU something like 20 years to get around to ratifying a simple uncomplicated document like the law of the sea convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia, as a matter of principle, does not support the linking of trade with human rights. It is interesting that no other countries in the OECD, with the exception of South Korea, have done so. Russia has, but we would not want to go too deeply into Russia's respect for human rights. Countries like the US and Canada are party to agreements which were signed prior to April&hyphen;May 1995 when this new requirement came in. Our problem is that we will not sign a document which specifically links human rights with trade agreements, a document which would enable either party to suspend or terminate the agreement unilaterally without prior consultation in the event of an alleged breach of article 1 on human rights. Article 1 is linked with article 32 on non&hyphen;fulfilment, which allows one party to take appropriate measures if it considers that the other has failed to fulfil an obligation under the agreement. I can understand that the Democrats cannot follow a matter of principle, but I ask them to be charitable and try to see this from a more detached point of view. There is a very important principle involved here for the Australian nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, in essence, this debate is not about human rights. I go back to recent press reports to quote the EC Ambassador, Aneurin Hughes. I heard him on a radio yesterday morning. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I entirely agree with the Prime Minister in that this dispute is simply not about human rights as such. There is very little difference between our position on human rights and that of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That position was supported, of course, by Sir Leon Brittan, the Vice&hyphen;President of the European Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point I want to raise is what happens if this agreement is not signed. Again, it is not about trade; it is about sectoral agreements in relation to cultural matters, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> education, customs policies and things like that. Senator Cook really ought to know, but I did not expect Mr Smith to know that Australia's trade agreements are covered by the WTO&mdash;the World Trade Organisation&mdash;and the agreements that flow from that. We will not sell one more pound of beef, one more grain of wheat, one nut or one bolt if we sign this agreement with the European Commission. It does not affect trade at all&mdash;that is one of the great misnomers of the day. But we do want to sign it, and we will sign it because it will facilitate the interchange of ideas and meetings between Australia and the European Commission, and that is very important to our trading future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I want to say that we are committed to human rights. In this parliament alone, brief though it is, the record of this government is that it has raised East Timor in five meetings with the Indonesian foreign minister. The government has raised the matter of human rights constructively in China in meetings between the foreign minister and the Chinese foreign minister. It has supported as strongly as it can the moves internationally to oppose the SLORC regime in Burma. The government has given money to human rights causes around the world. The government sees that in this agreement the opportunity is there for it to advance further by maintaining that difference between human rights and trade agreements. It is not, at the end of the day, a dispute about the commitment of Australia to support human rights. Australia's support for human rights is unequivocal. Our record is second to none. The issue is whether or not Australia should sign a treaty which clearly links trade with human rights and would allow either party to suspend the agreement or terminate it unilaterally on the basis of undefined criteria.</PARA></SPEECH>

As Senator MacGibbon quite rightly points out, we are directed by the World Trade Organisation in just about everything we do these days, including social, environmental and other issues. Our food standards, arms trade and so on are regulated. What we can and cannot do is directed by the World Trade Organisation. This agreement says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures shall be notified immediately to the other Party and shall be the subject of consultations . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It does not say anything about cutting off trade. It simply says that, if this is part of the trade agreement, each of the groups who are involved in that say that they would like to be part of consultations if the other party suddenly decides that they no longer want to be part of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, by which I mean that they may take actions which might be seen by other countries to be breaching that international declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a particularly radical agreement. It does not require Australia or the European Union to do anything that suggests that they could have consultations. I do not think that is such a bad thing. The reason I do not think it is such a bad thing is that honourable senators will remember that over time I have talked about issues like human rights and about environmental standards; that is, whether or not wood comes through rainforests in unsustainable ways, whether or not if we import fish it is done at the expense of fish populations, whether or not food standards are what Australian standards would choose or whether they are now being dictated by other countries. It is the lowest common denomina 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tor. These are the kinds of issues that I have mentioned over time that should be able to be dealt with in trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the arrangements that we have come to as a result of our signing the Uruguay Round of GATT, now the World Trade Organisation says that we do not have a lot of choice in these issues. We do not have a lot of choice in whether or not we import goods which have been produced in an environmentally unsustainable way. We do not have a lot of choice except to accept lowest common denominators in a lot of food standards&mdash;in the amount of radiation in foods, in the processing of foods. There is even controversy about whether we can label goods as being genetically modified. We do not have a lot of say in that any more because in a totally undemocratic way the World Trade Organisation can dictate what Australia does and does not do in those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In human rights issues, we have been told again and again by the previous Labor government that the International Labour Organisation will look after basic labour standards and things like prison labour and child labour. We have been told by people on both sides of the chamber that we should leave environment and human rights for other treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an irony because when we keep looking for where that other place is we find that treaties like the International Convention Against the Elimination of Racial Discrimination is one particular treaty which Australia has signed, and the coalition government are not too comfortable with it. Why are they not too comfortable with it? Under that treaty Australia could be criticised if we even move to remove rights under the Racial Discrimination Act or if Australia makes noises not to sign any agreements in relation to further greenhouse reductions. Why? Because Australia feels they should be a special case. When it comes down to it, when push comes to shove, when you look at that other area of treaties, you find that even the treaties Australia signs, and there are some very important treaties Australia is not keen to keep to&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a question of the appropriateness of including human rights in a trade framework agreement that we are concerned about. This agreement alone will not provide any greater trade access to the European Union. To be frank, it is an agreement that is very strong on symbolism. It is about a pro&hyphen;forma set of words that overarch agreements between the European Union and its trading partners. This present European Union requirement was introduced in May 1995. Since then Australian officials, including at ambassadorial level, have consistently registered their concerns about these human rights provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's objections were first raised under Labor, and never changed, while former foreign minister Mr Evans strutted around the world probably being as rude to foreigners as he was to us in the Senate. Today it is the shadow minister for trade, a Mr Smith&mdash;not Mr Beazley, not Mr Evans or Mr Brereton, ministers in the previous government who acted exactly as we have done&mdash;who now says that Labor would have signed or would sign the agreement.

They are apologists for almost everything that this government and, in fact, the previous government stood for, and this motion is no exception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is totally inappropriate to make the linkage between trade and human rights in this way. As previous speakers have said, the World Trade Organisation, the WTO, does not support this linkage. In fact, the WTO deals with trade access, so this agreement will provide no greater Australian trade access into Europe nor will it permit the European Union to impose greater tariffs to punish Australian trade. Both Australia and the EU are happy to include in the preamble to this agreement a reference to our common commitment to the protection of human rights and have even agreed on a form of words which has to go back to the commission for review. It should be noted that neither Canada, the US nor Japan have had to review their particular overarching trade agreements with the EU because they were signed before 1995.</PARA>

On this issue, Noel Pearson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there's nothing in our recent history about which we can feel ashamed, is there something in our prospective history about which we might feel that we are going to enter into a breach of human rights?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Could that be the government ignoring the principles in the Racial Discrimination Act to overturn the High Court's Wik decision on native title and pastoral leases? That is a question that I think the government's action leaves for the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Cook has said, Prime Minister Howard told a senior German minister that this government would not be backing down over human rights and trade because any European country would have the option of walking away from its obligations under the agreement on the basis of undefined human rights criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The European Union has used the human rights clause to punish only two countries&mdash;Somalia and Nigeria. Does the Australian government fear that our human rights record is no better than that in Somalia or Nigeria? That is the question the government ought to answer. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="468">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very proud to hear former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam talk at the Sydney Town Hall last Sunday. He touched on a related matter: the hostility of the Howard government and previous coalition governments towards International Labour Organisation conventions. Members of this coalition government have a pathological hatred of international conventions. That has been demonstrated in this chamber on so many occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gough Whitlam used the example of the disgraceful downsizing of the Australian delegation to the ILO in June of last year to highlight the Howard government's isolationism. There were no federal and no state ministers as part of that delegation. We are no longer represented on the ILO governing body. Worst of all, the Australian government is no longer supporting ILO programs in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bourne gave a long list, including UNICEF, of international organisations that have been cut by this government, showing the government's isolationism and its lack of interest in proper international cooperation. The common pattern in this government is a lack of interest in acting for human rights and industrial rights and a lack of interest in helping other countries raise the quality of their human rights practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, we are at an impasse and Australia is suffering because of it. Our international reputation is suffering and unemployed Australians are being denied jobs, because trade is at the kernel of solving unemployment in the long term. The solution is simple. It is straightforward. Yet the Howard-Fischer government procrastinates. I make the point that it is a coalition government because the National Party members are just as guilty of indecisiveness over this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the situation we are in at the moment, you see that we have got an $11.4 billion deficit with the EC. That is very serious. Along with the United States deficit, these are perhaps the two biggest areas we need to address with improved trade and cooperation arrangements. Unfortunately, this government has been incapable of being 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> decisive. As it does on so many other things, it has wasted the opportunity before it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleagues Senator MacGibbon and Senator Sandy Macdonald on this motion of urgency. The government is opposing this motion. Our fundamental problem is the specific linkage between human rights and possible non-fulfilment action in the operative part of the draft agreement. I would like to take issue with the remarks made by Senator Margetts, who indicated that no non-fulfilment action would take place without consultation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Article 32 on non-fulfilment allows one party to take appropriate measures and to take such measures without prior consultation in circumstances of special urgency. Together, article 32 and article 31 would enable either party to suspend or terminate the agreement unilaterally without prior consultation. The government's attitude to this treaty is not one of fear or loathing. On the other hand, we are simply not prepared to agree to provisions in a trade agreement which will allow either party unilaterally to undertake the actions that I have just mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts also said that we do not have a choice. We do have a choice. This is the choice that both the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have announced&mdash;that we find the inclusion of the human rights clause unacceptable in a trade and economic framework. Any issues of trade and cooperation will not be solved by the inclusion of a human rights clause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, Senator Bourne, we are distancing ourselves from international forums, why is it that during this year the Italian foreign minister will make his first visit in nine years, the French foreign minister will make his first visit in 13 years, the German economics minister will make his first visit in nine years, the Dutch Prime Minister will make his first visit and we will have the first visit by a German head of government for nine years? None of this is distancing us from international forums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How many other countries have agreed to human rights provisions in their agreements 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="469"> with the European Community? Only around nine of the European Community's agreements with other countries include both human rights and associated non-fulfilment provisions as proposed for the agreement with Australia. That alone should sound warning bells. No other OECD country except South Korea has agreed to sign a comparable agreement containing these clauses. Many of the other types of agreement entered into are different types of agreement not comparable to the text we have under discussion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Childs indicated the long list of non-compliance with human rights clauses instanced by Senator Bourne. Unfortunately, I do not have time to read out the equally long list that I have of the government's recent action on human rights. But I can assure you that none of them indicate our pathological hatred of international institutions. On the contrary, all of them indicate our willingness to be involved at this level, but there is equal caution over why we should not be involved in international treaties or framework agreements without carefully studying them first and making sure that they work to the benefit of Australia and not to its disadvantage in international forums.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The government has a very real concern in relation to all these measures because the mandate the government received at the last election has not been observed by the Senate. There is no doubt that during the election in February the then opposition made it very clear that it would proceed to provide legislation for a waiting period of two years in terms of welfare benefits for newly arrived migrants. We did not specify social security benefits. In fact, it has been our intention to move to other measures outside the social security portfolio. We were quite clear about the need to do this. The government has not attempted to mislead the electorate. We have honoured our commitment, and the government believes it should be entitled to have that mandate put into effect.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. I appreciate your protection. For the purposes of making what I hope is a brief contribution in the same spirit as the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) suggested she might approach this yesterday, I will make a comment that applies to amendments 16, 17, 18, 22, 25, 26, 28, 31, 32, and 36 and then perhaps comment very briefly on the other questions before the chair. I think that would be a sensible way of dealing with these issues, which I know senators in the chamber are well apprised of because we have debated this matter at great length.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Senate has allowed this government to make new migrants wait two years before they can claim newstart, sickness or youth training allowance. This Senate has held this government to its election commitment. That really allows the government to keep most of the projected savings in relation to these measures. The only reason that the government is not already accruing savings from these measures is that it saw fit not to return the amended legislation to this chamber last year. I would be the first to concede that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="472"> savings would be a little less, but there still would have been quite substantial savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is on work experience, frankly, in relation to the way this place works. The fact of the matter is that it has been losing the much vaunted savings that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) had spoken about at such great length and it has been losing savings from the part of the measure that has in fact been improved by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But of course the Senate has not allowed the extension of the two-year waiting period to a range of payments beyond those which were canvassed by the government during the election campaign. So the Senate has not allowed a two-year waiting period on the higher rate of family payment, on maternity allowance, on health care cards and on a range of other payments. It has done no more or no less than to say to this government, `We require you to honour the commitment you made to the Australian people.' In other words, the government said that a range of payments would be subject to the extension of the waiting period from six months to two years, and those other payments have not been accepted by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Senate has not allowed the opportunity for the coalition to create a situation where new migrants who work and pay taxes are treated as second&hyphen;class citizens&mdash;not eligible for the payments available to other low income families such as the higher rates of family payment or rent assistance. The Senate has said to this coalition government, `We will not allow you to withdraw the social safety net from those people.' That was a perfectly reasonable position for us to have taken. For the Senate to say, `You are required to honour your political commitments; you are required to keep your word to the Australian people,' is not unreasonable. We do not resile from arguing that case strongly before this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other amendments before us&mdash;Nos 20, 23 and 34, so very well described by you, Mr Chairman, as category B amendments, which ought to confuse a lot of people as they ponder the difference between them&mdash;are basically omissions to restore exemption from the waiting period where a partner has already 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been in Australia for six months. In relation to those three amendments the opposition's position remains the same. Our opposition of course to these items effectively restores the exemption and I will be commending to this chamber this evening our continued strong support for this position.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats' position in relation to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill and these changes has not changed. Many of the amendments&mdash;numbered 16 through to about 33&mdash;we are dealing with largely reflect the amendments that I moved during the debate last year on the social security bill. The Democrats made clear then, as I hope to do now, our opposition to the intent behind that bill. We found quite mean spirited the move by the government to extend in some cases a two-year waiting period for benefits that already had a waiting period, but we were also quite angry at the attempt to apply a two-year waiting period to a raft of social security benefits and measures that had previously not had a waiting period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner's point is particularly important: this cuts to the heart of the issue as to how we view and treat migrants in our community. I make very clear to people&mdash;and this was not so clear in previous debates on this and other measures&mdash;that this bill is not about how many people or the types of people that are coming to our country but how we treat people when they get here. We found it an issue of justice, fairness and equity. For those reasons we opposed most of the measures proposed by the government in relation to the two-year waiting period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But of course, as we know, we received support for the ones before us now&mdash;carer's pension, widow allowance, et cetera. We acknowledge that the opposition supported the government on those benefits that had not been mentioned in the election campaign. We understand that rationale, but the Democrats still remain opposed to the two-year waiting period for those benefits as well.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="473">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this case we also need to make clear that the policy of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) did change. I think it was acknowledged by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in correspondence. It was very clear to me in the election campaign that the benefits that were being talked about in relation to a two&hyphen;year waiting period were those that already had a waiting period&mdash;specifically, sickness, the dole, youth training. It was acknowledged by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives on 22 May last year when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can I just make it perfectly clear to the Leader of the Opposition that . . . You introduced a six-month period. All we have done is to extend your six months to two years.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is no mention about going from a zero waiting period to a two-year waiting period. It was under the ALP government that payments such as the sickness allowance, the parenting allowance, the youth training allowance and the dole had a six-month waiting period attached to them. In the election campaign the coalition said that they would extend the waiting period to two years, but they did not seek to extend that waiting period to about 12 other social security measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to make clear not only to members of the parliament but also to members of the community who may be listening and who may have been under different impressions as a result of the media hype and propaganda which surrounded the last debate on this issue that the Senate gave the coalition three out of four social security waiting periods which they requested and which they campaigned on during the election. There is a two-year waiting period for youth training, sickness and unemployment benefits. Any attempts by commentators, shock jocks or any other media personalities to imply otherwise is quite false and quite wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are not trifling measures, but they cut to the heart of how we treat people in this country. They go to the very issue of what it is like to live in a free, civilised and democratic community. There are principal reasons why we have opposed these measures. There are also reasons in relation to the election 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> campaign. Basically our objection has been on the grounds of fairness and a changed position by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make clear the estimated cost of these measures. If the minister has a different estimation, I hope she will make it clear. I was concerned by the view perpetuated by the Treasurer, Peter Costello, that somehow these measures would cost an inordinate amount. His figures have been quite large. My understanding is that the estimated cost of not applying the waiting period to those benefits that previously did not have a waiting period is between $28 million and $50 million per annum. If the minister could clarify that, I would appreciate it. The Treasurer has implied that there would be a budget blow&hyphen;out as a consequence of these measures. These measures are unfair and inequitable. For those reasons, the Democrats's position has not changed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I briefly indicate to the committee that I will be supporting this motion. I suspect that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) will clarify her intentions in regard to certain measures before they are debated, particularly amendments 10 to 14.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have looked at the issue of the mandate which the government is talking about. Whether or not the government has a mandate, this chamber has the right to review legislation and to consider those matters on their merits. However, members of this chamber need to understand that when confronted with legislation which is clearly of a fiscal character, in order to achieve the government's and therefore the country's fiscal targets, this also needs to be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, we have had considerable discussions. In fact, before the legislation was originally proposed, certain discussions took place. Those discussions resulted in a number of amendments ab initio, including, for example, the question of widows allowance. It was proposed by the government that widows allowance not be available within the two-year period. What if a married couple came to Australia and the husband was killed the next day? Obviously there is a need for the government to take those matters into 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="474"> consideration. It did that ab initio and, because of changed circumstances, such people will receive widows allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the original legislation was passed, we in this chamber expressed support for a number of other areas. I would like to give an example. It is one which you know of, Mr Chairman, because it is about a constituent of yours in Queensland whom I understand you had a good deal to do with. A pensioner on a single pension married a person in Europe who did not have residency status in Australia. He then brought his bride out here. Under these provisions, he would go from a single pension to a half married pension and she would not get any pension. Because he married, he will go from a single pension to a half married pension&mdash;which is much less&mdash;and his spouse will be excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was picked up by the minister after representation was made to her. A number of things have happened like that, and I will not go into them. But I do indicate to the Senate that I will be supporting the motion that has been moved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have looked thoroughly at this question of what was said by the minister at the time. In a press release on 23 May 1996, the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Migrants entering Australia after 1 April 1996 will now have to have wait two years for some welfare benefits instead of six months, as is currently the case.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She then went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A coalition government will continue to grant all refugee and humanitarian migrants eligibility to access welfare benefits immediately upon their arrival in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Access to welfare benefits for migrants, other than refugee and humanitarian migrants, will be available after two years under a coalition government. This extension will have little direct impact on those migrants, particularly those in the preferential family reunion category, who are accepted for entry into Australia on the basis of formal assurances of support.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I will read the next paragraph to foreshadow what I will do on another matter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full access to family allowance and Medicare will be maintained for all migrants immediately upon arrival.  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Thus on the family allowance I will be taking a different view from that which I am taking on this, because that clearly indicates they are talking about not just family payments but also full access to family allowance. But I am anticipating another debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether the minister wants to explain to the Senate at the present moment what she is proposing on the disability matters and also the carer pensions. In addition, I have had discussions with the minister in respect of special benefits. As I understand it, the government has prepared guidelines which will cover a number of the cases which clearly call for a consideration under the special benefits guidelines.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine, has said that he will be supporting the motion that has been moved, indicating therefore, that he will be supporting the government in that we do not insist on the amendments that the Senate made to the legislation on its first passage through this place. I just draw that to the honourable senator's attention. He may make that clear for my benefit. This would mean that the Senate's insistence that there is not a two-year waiting period for newly arrived migrants for these benefits be dropped.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens have not changed our position on this at all. What the Senate is now considering is whether it will stand firm on its refusal to allow the government to cut benefits to newly arrived residents to this country meaning that they could not access those benefits for two years. If the cutting of those benefits does occur, it will put a whole range of people coming into the country at a disadvantage with other citizens. It will make them second class citizens from the outset. It will make life much more difficult for them, even though a good many of those people who are to arrive will be sheltered from these provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We opposed that measure before and will be opposing it again. Senator Stott Despoja has pointed out that these pretty niggardly measures from the government will save it something less than $50 million in a given year. The minister wrinkles her brow at that and she obviously will give us the correct 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="475"> figures in a moment&mdash;and that will be no difficulty for her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, whatever the figure is, I would point out again that this government buckled at the knees over the diesel fuel rebate and this year will be handing the mining giants, those corporations, in this country $800 million on a platter. So the government cannot extend these benefits to newly arrived Australians because it wants to save somewhere between $29 million and $50 million, but it can find $800 million to give to the big mining corporations who happen to enter the same dinner cycle that many members of the government are in. BHP alone will get $100 million benefit out of having its fuel levy returned to it in a big fat cheque at the end of the year&mdash;and that is more than double the amount that would allow thousands of people coming to this country to have access to benefits when they need them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine has given two instances where people will find themselves seriously disadvantaged and in real trouble in this country if they do not have the same access to benefits that the rest of Australians do. But, of course, there are myriad such examples of hardship this government is foisting on newly arrived Australians because it wants to tighten its budget in a way that it seems totally unable to do and incapable of doing when it comes to its friends in the big mining corporations. I only to have remind the Senate that we are talking about corporations which in some cases have two, three or four executives each taking home more than $1 million each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we see is this divisiveness, through government policy, of the community in a way which makes it difficult for those people who are least advantaged, and feathers the nests and lines the pockets of those who are already advantaged. That is what this government is about. It is pretty nasty and it is pretty mean. The chamber said that we are not going to have that at least as far as these provisions are concerned, because the numbers were here to keep some compassion and commonsense and regard for newly arrived Australians who would otherwise not have access to these benefits, at least in the period 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> six months to two years after they arrived here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hope that the chamber is going to stand firm on this. I would hope that the argument that prevailed before will prevail now. I would hope that Senator Harradine&mdash;when he said he would be supporting the motion that the chamber does not insist on its previous amendments&mdash;maybe got that back-to-front. Otherwise it means that the chamber will potentially lose the numbers to stick by the principle and the social justice and the real need for specific peoples in our community that this chamber stood for just a couple of months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope we are not going to get into the situation we had just before Christmas, where Senator Harradine cut out, like filleting a fish, some sections of the community to get social security benefits because he used that pivotal vote when others could not. They got cut out because they happened to have a different lifestyle or a different configuration in the way in which they live. That remains to be seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate that the Greens are opposed to the government's contention that this chamber should buckle to the government majority in the House of Representatives and drop the interest of the people who will be hurt. This is real hurt we are talking about. They will be deprived of benefits that other Australians have access to because they happened to have newly arrived in this country. I would hope that other members of the chamber will stand firm on those amendments that the senators made in majority to the government's legislation before Christmas.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some comments on some of the issues that have been raised by honourable senators. I would first of all insist that, despite earlier claims of Senator Stott Despoja, the government sincerely believes it has a mandate. As I said in the debate that we had for nearly an hour last night, the government took a document to the Australian people. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="476">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Access to welfare benefits for migrants other than refugee and humanitarian migrants will be available after two years under a Coalition Government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is spelled out in the document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS> , which was released by Mr Costello in February last year during the election. So Australians were told very clearly what we would do. The document went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full access to Family Allowance and Medicare will be maintained for all migrants immediately upon arrival. As well, the Coalition will provide a `safety net' in the form of a special allowance for those migrants whose circumstances change significantly after arrival in Australia for reasons beyond their personal control.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We also said that the financial implications would be something in the order of $616 million over three years. That, quite clearly, was never going to be just an extension of the existing measures relating to some unemployment payments that the previous government already had in place for the first six months of a migrant's arrival. Clearly, just by the amount of savings that were being described there, it was welfare benefits, not social security benefits, that were spelled out here. Clearly that can cover welfare benefits in other portfolios such as health and family services or DEETYA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there has been no attempt to hoodwink the Australian people and certainly no attempt to hoodwink this chamber. I believe the statement of our intention&mdash;and therefore the claim for our mandate&mdash;has been always very clear. Despite the debate that went on in this chamber, the government stands by its claim to a mandate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did not believe that six months was sufficient. Senator Brown, in his comments just now, portrayed us as mean-spirited, hard-hearted and all the other things that he said. I would remind him that in international terms Australia is one of the most generous countries for access by new people to benefits, to protection, to a safety net. There will still be a safety net there for people in those first two years if their circumstances change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also remind the chamber that migrants are expected to either sponsor themselves or be sponsored by others. It is not the duty of the Australian taxpayer to be first cab off the rank in rushing to support a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> newcomer to our country. It is first of all the duty of the migrant themselves, if they have self&hyphen;sponsored, or of the person who sponsored them. That is where the first call for support should come and, after that, the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja and again Senator Brown had a bit to say about costs and savings. It seems to me that they cannot have been in question time last year when I answered this question. I have a feeling the question might have come from Senator Kernot, but the response which I gave to the chamber that time was similar to the following.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was estimated that the savings from a two-year waiting period for newly arrived migrants would be $546 million over four years and, with the chamber's amendments, those savings would be reduced by approximately $400 million. The key reasons for this reduction in savings are not applying a 104-week waiting period for a range of payments and concessions, and that is $214.7 million over four years; delaying the starting date of the 104&hyphen;week waiting period for the newstart, youth training and sickness allowance; not applying a 104&hyphen;week waiting period for partners, and that was $124.9 million over four years; and not applying a 104&hyphen;week waiting period for special benefit where the circumstances had not changed unexpectedly, and that was another $65.3 million over four years. The chamber should also note that these figures are in 1996-97 dollars and have not been out&hyphen;turned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the figures are adjusted for future year dollars, the cost of the Senate amendments is even higher&mdash;approximately $427 million over the four years. Perhaps that will explain to Senator Stott Despoja, and also to Senator Brown, why the government was so particularly concerned at the rejection of so many measures by this chamber, especially in the financial circumstances that the government found itself in when it gained office. Nevertheless, it was implementing its election commitment. During the election campaign we said that the savings would be something in the order of $616 million. We are still looking at something like $400 million that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="477"> this chamber has taken from the savings in this legislation. No wonder the government has real concerns about the opposition by some of the Senate parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to very briefly go through some of the issues which have been raised, mainly by Senator Harradine. We have given a commitment that we will later move amendments which will enable special needs relatives to be exempt from the waiting period for the carer pension. That is because they are coming in on a visa which allows them to come in as the carer for somebody already in Australia. That is not only a humanitarian gesture but it is also of good sense to Australia, in that if there is somebody who can care for a family member, it is better for all concerned in financial terms as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the newly arrived residents waiting period for the disability wage supplement. Once again, we believe we have an electoral mandate. It should be clear that those who suffer disability after arrival in Australia, which causes a continuing inability to work, will be exempt. If that happens after they come here, for reasons beyond their control, they are exempt from that waiting period. I would also point out that the disability wage supplement is a substitute for the disability support pension, which has a 10-year resident waiting period. When you look at the pension situation, we have 10-year waiting periods and five-year waiting periods for pensions. It seems extraordinary that people can come on to a multiplicity of allowances. The chamber seems to think there should be no waiting period at all for many of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have given an undertaking about our willingness to amend the guidelines which are used by delegates in the Department of Social Security in cases where an Australian resident marries and their spouse comes into this country and then, for a variety of reasons, such as unemployment or sickness, et cetera, they need assistance. The delegates in the Department of Social Security already have the discretion to determine that somebody who is on a pension at a single rate and marries will still be able to get a single rate, as happens already. If their partner is in hospital or in a nursing home, we would be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prepared&mdash;and will&mdash;to amend the guidelines for the delegates so that it would include a spouse whose circumstances need support from their Australian resident spouse. So the Australian resident spouse would continue to receive a single rate of pension rather than the half married rate. I think that will help some people's concerns there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Things such as the mature age allowance should always have been included in the six-month waiting period that the previous government introduced. It is, after all, an unemployment payment for older, long-term unemployed people. It should be treated along the same lines as the newstart allowance. It seems strange to me that it was not included at the time that the other unemployment payments had a waiting period imposed upon them. It is a basic income support payment for unemployed people and the community expects a waiting  period to apply in those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of special benefit has been raised by Senator Harradine, and it is one matter that I want to make quite clear. If the chamber's previously expressed will on this matter were to succeed under this debate now, we would have a wonderful loophole for anybody who was refused access under the legislation to any of the other payments being able to come around the back door and immediately apply for a special benefit. I cannot remember the exact figure but I think about 30 per cent would be expected to go via that route to obtain special benefits if the arrangements which the government wanted to put into place could not succeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that there is an adequate safety net. There are two safety nets for migrants coming to Australia. There is the safety net of the undertaking which they themselves have given, perhaps as business migrants, or the undertaking which their sponsor has given by way of sponsorship or assurance of support. There is a safety net there that their needs will be met, and we expect that commitment to be honoured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also proposed under the legislation a special benefit payment which will come into effect where circumstances have changed for a migrant after they arrived in this coun 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="478"> try. These changes include such things as becoming widowed, losing a pre-arranged job after they get here and domestic violence. A number of issues may occur to a migrant after they get here which they would not have been able to prevent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The special benefit payment is there and it is fair. It is not only fair to the migrant, it is also fair to the Australian taxpayer. We do not expect people to come to Australia thinking that they are automatically going to get immediate help from the Australian taxpayer. It is only in special circumstances when that should happen. Partner allowance, of course, is once again part of the unemployment benefits system in the sense that the former government took an approach that people should qualify for social security payments in their own right. The unemployment payments were split down the middle for couples. That is how we arrived at partner allowance. It is appropriate that, if unemployment payments are not going to be available, neither should the partner allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parenting allowance already has a 26&hyphen;week waiting period. It should be recognised that the basic rate of parenting allowance, which is $64.80 a fortnight, represents the cashing&hyphen;out of the dependent spouse rebate. That rebate will still be available through the taxation system for newly arrived migrants who are in the work force. The larger proportion of parenting allowance, which is $244.10 a fortnight, forms the main part of the previous payment for spouses of the unemployed. Consistent with what I said about partner allowance, the waiting period for parenting allowance should also be extended. These are all payments in relation to the unemployment system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only other item I would add to this is the healthcare card. I want to emphase that Medicare access was promised and is available. People who experience a change in their circumstances after arriving in Australia and, therefore, qualify for special benefit would still have access to healthcare cards. The same would apply to other people who are exempt from the waiting period, such as refugees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These safety net measures are there. They have been honoured. I commend the motion 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the chamber on the basis that the government has a mandate for these measures. We have been very upfront about them. We have also put in place measures to protect people whose circumstances change.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to very briefly address the issue of special benefit, because this is a very important payment indeed. This is the payment of last resort. It is already very difficult to qualify for special benefit. After the new government's changes to liquid assets and hardship limits, it is even harder to qualify for special benefit. It is something that has always been discretionary. It has always been within the gift of the Department of Social Security to provide income support when the circumstances of people were demonstrably desperate. That is the truth of the matter.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that should be something which is not a surprise to honourable senators because I know that the Senate committee had access to a draft set of guidelines. I know some senators also had it. The sorts of circumstances in which a migrant's situation may change, for example, might include when their sponsor is unemployed and receiving newstart allowance, or is declared bankrupt, or is imprisoned, or is a patient in a psychiatric institution or a nursing home on a long-term basis, or has been reported to the police as a missing person and cannot be located by the police, or has left Australia permanently or has died.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are the sorts of situations in which the sponsor would be absolved from being the first port of call and that special benefit would come into play.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="481"> year, I was critical that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) did not front the chamber to have carriage of her own bill. My criticism is on the record. I am actually beginning to regret that criticism because, despite the difficulties that we had last time and the confusion that arose in voting on the amendments during the committee stage, I think we were making far better progress in carrying out our responsibilities and obligations to the people of Australia to scrutinise legislation than we are now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have just heard yet another tirade from the inept and incompetent minister with a personal attack on one of my colleagues in this chamber. This does not do the minister any good. It certainly does not do the chamber itself or the institution that we represent any good. It had not been my intention to enter into this committee stage debate on the bill but, while I was watching the proceedings on the monitor in my room, I heard the minister regurgitate some of the arguments that led to the reference of the bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, that led the Legal and Constitutional Committee to take evidence from the community of Australia in different parts of the country on the provisions of the bill. I was saddened that, despite all the time since the bill was first introduced to the Senate, some mistruths still prevail; mistruths are still being put to the people of Australia. I do not think that is good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The special benefits were the subject of quite a detail of deliberation during the committee processes when we took evidence in Canberra and Sydney. The special benefits were also the subject of many of the submissions to the committee. They were the subject of scrutiny by the committee, so much so that the majority of the committee, which was mainly made up of government members, made the following recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2: that guidelines made pursuant to the proposed section 739C should not be exclusive and should allow the Secretary of the Department of Social Security to exercise a general discretion to grant special benefits if in his or her opinion the person "has suffered a substantial change in circumstances beyond the person's control."  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I recall seeing some guidelines at the time of the committee deliberations which was in the middle part of last year. I cannot recall seeing anything since. We are now deliberating on this bill for the second time in the committee stage. Where are those guidelines? The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate made what seemed to me to be a very reasonable request of the minister: to have a look at the document relating to special benefits which she was quoting from. What was the response? A blunt and ignorant no. The minister is saying that the opposition&mdash;indeed, the chamber&mdash;is not entitled to look at something of great concern to her colleagues who served on the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. That behaviour is not good enough for a minister of the Crown. I hope this is the only occasion when that behaviour will occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What really provoked me to enter the debate was this fallacy about the mandate for the change. The mandate is a figment of the imagination of the minister and a figment of the imagination of the government. The mandate received some attention in the committee's report, which was tabled in this place in September last year. On page 11, paragraph 3.5 of the report, the committee went to the extent of quoting the relevant parts of Mr Costello's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments </EMPHASIS>document, which was issued on 19 February last year. The relevant part, in an extensive quote, is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In January 1993, the Labor Government introduced a six month wait after arrival in Australia for migrants, other than refugees and humanitarian migrants, before they became eligible to receive most welfare benefits. Access to welfare benefits for migrants other than refugee and humanitarian migrants will be available after two years under a Coalition Government. This will have little impact on those migrants, particularly those in the Preferential Family Reunion category, who are accepted for entry into Australia on the basis of formal assurances of support. Full access to Family Allowance and Medicare will be maintained for all migrants immediately upon arrival. As well the Coalition will provide a "safety net" in the form of a special allowance for those migrants whose circumstances change significantly after arrival in Australia for reasons beyond their personal control. The Coalition projects that this will achieve savings of $602 million over three years. However, this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="482"> policy will apply to prospective migrants only. It will not be applied retrospectively or to migrants who arrive in Australia before 1 April 1996.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If that was, as Senator Newman has said on innumerable occasions since then, a clear enunciation of the policy to the electorate prior to the general election of March last year, then I certainly need some greater education in the Australian political scene, and I do not believe I do. I am not alone, nor are my colleagues on this side of the chamber, in stating that there was no clear enunciation of how the now government was going to attack newly arrived migrants. There was no clear enunciation in that policy statement whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the people who came before the committee complaining that they did not accept that there was a clear enunciation of a mandate for the extensive changes which were later introduced in the form of this bill included Mr Simikoff, the chief executive officer of the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia. The committee's report registered the federation's opposition to the bill on the basis that the content of the bill had not been adequately foreshadowed during the election. There is an extensive quote in the committee's report of what Mr Simikoff had to say on behalf of the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, the peak body of ethnic community councils in Australia. I will not labour the committee by going through it all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further down on the same page of the committee's report is a quote by Ms Angela Chan, the chairperson of the Ethnic Communities Council of New South Wales, who also objected to the bill on the basis that it was not adequately foreshadowed during the election. Ms Ulrike Bartels, a member of the Fairfield Migrant Resource Centre&mdash;the committee thought it worth while to include this&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's pre-election multicultural and settlement services policy gave no indication of the introduction of this bill. It was not until mid-February that an extension of the six-months waiting period was proposed, and it did not embargo the range of social security system payments now included. This was only two weeks before the election, an inadequate time frame for the com 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> munity to really debate the subject, and we are grateful that we are here&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is, at the committee's public hearings in Sydney&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to debate it today.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clearly there was a lot of smoke around at the time of the election. There were no clearly defined policies out there in the public arena. The people of Australia were hit with a number of major policy statements over a short period of time. Some of them, those relating to immigration and ethnic affairs, were released almost in the dead of night, but certainly after most of the main TV stations had gone to their news breaks, so those statements were covered up. If this is an example of the government's clear enunciation of policies to be administered on election to government, if this is an example of what a mandate is about, it sets a new low mark in the Australian political scene.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) said in relation to the benefits that we should wait until we see what she called regulations which we codified through a disallowable instrument, and then she refused to table the document that was being worked upon because it had scribblings from senators who were interested. Well, I think all senators are interested in that document. What the minister is really saying to the chamber is, `Trust us. Later on, if you pass this, we will put out a list of conditions upon which we think the newly arrived Australians should depend if they are going to get special benefits.' That is clearly not good enough. We should have all that information before the committee when making a decision as to whether we are going to vote for or against what the government has in mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That aside, it really does concern me that, if Senator Harradine avers he will be supporting the motion, the benefits that people now enjoy as newly arrived Australians, under all the categories we are considering, will not be available until they have been here for two years plus. What has happened in the last three months to make the difference? I would like to know from Senator Harradine why people whom, when he voted earlier, he 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="483"> considered ought to have access to benefits between the period of six months and two years after their arrival ought now not be given access to those benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it just because the government is insisting that the Senate buckle? Is there some other arrangement that has been made, or has Senator Harradine, on reflection, just considered that newly arrived Australians in these categories ought not after all get the benefits that other Australians get? I would just like to hear an expansion of the argument as to why the good senator has changed his mind. I think the committee deserves to know the reasons for that change, which is going to have a very big effect&mdash;if his vote becomes central to the government winning&mdash;on a good many people who are going to be in very difficult circumstances over the coming years because of the government's social direction, as embodied in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the minister said, `Oh, no. It is going to save the government more than what Senator Stott Despoja said. It will be, in effect, $427 million over the next four years to cut these people out of their benefits.' Let me again say that that is $107 million per annum to cut thousands of people out of benefits; to leave them in hard straits; to leave them in miserable circumstances in a new country, not infrequently on their own, not infrequently without the support that they would have had in their previous circumstances or that the average Australian who has been here for a longer period of time might have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, this year, this minister's government, I reiterate, is handing $800 million in a levy rebate to the big mining corporations to fatten up their profit lines. This is a fair go country, but the government wants to cut $107 million out of these people's entitlements&mdash;because that is what they are&mdash;and put that towards the $800 million diesel fuel rebate which the miners were able to get out of this government when it wimped out and went weak at the knees simply because the miners arrived in town and put a bit of pressure on Mr Howard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that you see writ large the divisiveness of the antisocial policies of this government, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which says there shall be two Australias: one for the haves and one for the have&hyphen;nots. This legislation&mdash;this attempt to make the Senate go weak, which Senator Harradine apparently is going to support in these particular amendments&mdash;is about leaving the have-nots to suffer so that the government can meet part of its budget imperatives, as it sees it, at the expense of these people. That is pretty rotten, pretty mean and pretty despicable for all those who are going to vote for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to hear a better argument as to how you justify it. I note that the government says, `Oh, it was part of our policy.' As Senator Faulkner says, that has been debunked here already. Contrary to debate that we heard a little earlier on the Telstra legislation, Senator Harradine says, `Whether or not the government has a mandate, the chamber has a right to consider the matter on its merits.' With that, I agree.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I6">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</NAME><STATE> (South Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(6.19 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just briefly, first of all, I would like to thank Senator McKiernan for his excellent contribution, for clarifying beyond a doubt the work of the committee, for denunciating some of the positions of FECCA and people such as Ms Angela Chan and Mr Victor Rebikoff, and also for clarifying the issue which seems to be getting some debate; that is, the election policy of the coalition and the issue of mandate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Debates in this place often come down to people indulging in `my mandate is bigger than yours' discussion, but Senator Newman said that there was not an attempt to hoodwink and that this debate might be in fact some kind of furphy. Regardless of that, the Australian Democrats make clear that we had objections to all of your attempts to extend the two-year waiting period. It is not simply those benefits that were previously covered by the six-month waiting period. I reiterate again that the Democrats found the attempt to extend it not only to the original four but to something like 12 other benefits quite mean spirited and inappropriate indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We reached the same conclusion, based on what both Senators Harradine and Brown have referred to, and that is the role of the Senate and the role of the people here as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="484"> legislators to assess legislation and measures on their merits and draw a conclusion as to whether or not the measures are fair and equitable. The conclusion we drew was that the measures were not fair and equitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wanted to refer, in taking advantage of this opportunity, to Senator Newman's comments previously about access to benefits for migrants in this country. She mentioned that benefits should be accessed in special circumstances. The point that I want to make from the Democrat perspective is that the benefits that we are talking about are only accessed in special circumstances; that migrants pay taxes indirectly and directly; that migrants are not bludgers; and that they have to pass a series of tests, whether concerning health, character or assurance of support tests, before they are admitted to this country and before they are considered successful migrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an important point that we must not lose in this debate&mdash;that there is an economic contribution, as well as obviously many other contributions, that is made by migrants entering this country. Once they enter this country they are expected to contribute in the same way that all other Australians do. For that, they are also expected to be treated equally under the law and, I believe, should have access to the same benefits and services that other Australians do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth remembering the kind of benefits that we are looking at here. Senator Faulkner referred to the special benefit, which is known as the payment of last resort. There is the disability wage supplement, a supplement to disabled workers; the widow allowance; the carers pension; maternity allowance; mobility allowance. These are measures that, on reflection, target the most vulnerable groups; the kind of people that are going to access these benefits only if they are in special circumstances, if they are in dire straits. Look at whom we are targeting&mdash;not just migrants, not just some of the most vulnerable people in our community, but women and disabled people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to women, I made it very clear in my speech during the second reading debate how distressed I was at how many of these 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benefits particularly targeted migrant women. For that reason, again we conclude, based on the merits of the legislation, that it is, in fact, a penny&hyphen;pinching, economically rationalist and mean&hyphen;spirited measure. That is why our opinion on this has not changed. One other comment that the minister made in regard to the safety net, or the social security system that we have in this country, was the fact that yes, we are perhaps one of the more appropriately generous countries when it comes to allowing access to these benefits. That is a reputation that I want us to maintain and to celebrate. I think that our social security system, which provides a safety net to people who are unable to provide for themselves&mdash;and let us not forget that that is when people access these particular benefits&mdash;is a concrete underpinning in this country of the national ethos of a fair go. I would hate to see that ethos being sacrificed to an economic rationalist objective.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McKiernan, I congratulate you on your contribution to this debate. But, as I come back to that question, I do say this: what Senator Brown has not acknowledged is, of course, the concessions that have been obtained from the government in respect of the negotiations not only this time but the first time around. The second thing is that, as has been indicated by the government, the extension that we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="485"> are dealing with, both in terms of category and also in terms of time, will have little direct impact on those migrants, particularly those in the preferential family reunion category who are accepted for entry into Australia on the basis of assurances of financial support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the migration policy is under attack and that there are people in this community who do not want migrants. It is easy enough for people to get up in this place and make statements but you have got to get out there to support migration into this country, particularly if you have got the underpinning that we will have, as I understand it, and we do have in respect of financial assurances. With regard to the other matter, that has been there for some time; we have got to have a look at that. We do have to have a look at what the government is very serious about. It is very serious about this and I have had a think about it on a political level, I must say. I do not know whether I should say this, but I thought there was a possibility that the government may use this as a measure which would, if we reject it, be taken to the campaign trail. So it could be said of us: `Here we are, we are going to pay migrants and make sure that we are supporting them. We are opposing the government's fiscal measures which are affecting all Australians and yet we are not prepared to apply certain fiscal constraints when it comes to migrants.' That would be a dirty debate and that would raise the whole question of&mdash;</PARA>

I noted what the government did instead of that, and I had initial discussions in respect of this matter so I know. That was before we disallowed it here and before it got back to the House of Representatives. What the government was prepared to do there was to look at the matter and deal with it in a manner that would cut off their ability to use that as a double dissolution trigger. That is what they have done, of course. They have sent the legislation back to us, accepting some of our amendments and not others. So they have pulled that plug and,

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will try to, Sir, and you might see that the interjections do not distract me. Having said that, the point being made from the other side was that they do not get access to the benefits anyway so they will not be losing them. That is making a point of no significance, to the misery of those people who, through the vote of people opposite, will be denied benefits that other Australians get. Talk about compassion! I ask senators: where is the compassion in that?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A guide to what is going on here is that Senator Harradine said the preferential family category is being looked after to some degree by what the government is doing. But we are living in a world in which households are not routinely like they used to be: simply made up of a two&hyphen;parent and number of children complement. There are all sorts of arrangements these days, and people are living in all sorts of different circumstances in a very fluid and changing society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a great concern about this trend coming from the opposite side, not least Senator Harradine, that if you do not happen to be in what is called a family circumstance in a home you do not get government assist 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ance. I have said this before in this place. It appears to be that, as arbiter of the ethics and morals of people in this country, this pivotal vote from Senator Harradine is being used to cut out those people who happen to be down on their luck and who happen to be divorced from the wonderful circumstances of being within the family fold and out on the streets or in unhappy circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to allow that sort of criterion to flourish in this place, because of the ultimate divisiveness that it leads to. This country has to be bigger and more magnanimous than that, and it has to have a place in its largesse for everybody who is down on their luck, not least those who are newly arrived in this country. An element of added discrimination will creep into the deliberations of the Senate if we indeed go the way the government wants because of a change of vote in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is going to happen, it is going to happen. I cannot stop that, the Greens cannot stop that&mdash;nor can any other entity on this side of the House. But let it be seen and acknowledged by all on both sides for what it is: a discriminatory policy on the basis of whether people are in circumstances that are considered traditional and acceptable or not traditional and therefore not warranting equal treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there we have it. I believe this chamber should stand firm, that it should not accept the motion from the minister that we do not insist on the compassionate amendments made by this place just before Christmas which would shelter newly arrived Australians who need access to our social security system and should not have to wait two years to get that access when they may have, so soon after coming to this country, the sort of need that other Australians may have.</PARA></SPEECH>

If they were then disallowed, we would not be able to pay the special benefit as you have proposed; but the government could then come back with more guidelines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You may have forgotten, Senator Faulkner, that I said earlier, when you were not really very interested in listening, that the guidelines have been around in a draft form for several months now and the committee had access to them. Some senators have already made proposals to me for some changes to them. So the department is continuing to try to get those guidelines in a form which will be acceptable to make sure that people do not fall between the cracks&mdash;after all, they are, if you like, in a very real sense beneficial guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are prepared to stand aside from the process and not be involved, then that is a

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about draft guidelines. They are not, as you know, by custom tabled until such time as the legislation is passed. I have done the courtesy to the Senate of over several months now having some draft guidelines available for discussion, but they have not been formally distributed. I appreciate the efforts which some senators have made to make sure that the guidelines are as good as we can possibly make them so that they accommodate the needs of people who fall into difficulties. I hope that you would commit yourself to being involved in that process too so that there can be no question that the Senate would feel the need to disallow them when they are tabled after the passing of this legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to speak in the adjournment debate about the government's proposed work for the dole scheme. Following the announcement of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), I have listened now for two days to what he deems is a very worthwhile program that is somehow going to deliver to some 100,000 young unemployed Australians the opportunity to gain full and meaningful work. In announcing this proposal, he said that some 30,000 of these young Australians have been out of work for periods of longer than six months and that the government would introduce a number of pilot programs of both a compulsory and voluntary nature. He also went on to say that there would need to be an amendment to the Social Security Act to enable the program to be implemented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of these issues raise some very serious questions, given the now government's criticism of our labour market programs when we were in government, which had far greater coverage and provided far greater opportunity for a significantly larger number of unemployed Australians, both young and old, to actually gain experience through properly accredited training programs. I think those programs had a very high success rate in that over the period 1994 to 1996 they actually provided for some 700,000 jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think one of the questions that the Prime Minister and the government have yet to address themselves to is: how is this scheme going to work? We can look at some of the statements the Prime Minister made in parliament. On 10 February 1997, in answer to a question from Mr Anthony, he says:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="490">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We intend to pilot about 20 to 30 of these schemes in areas of high youth unemployment especially, but not only, in regional and rural areas of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He says further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that most Australians will strongly support the notion that it is not unfair in modern Australia to ask people, if they are able to do so, to undertake some work in return for the dole they receive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He says further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a hard core of about 30,000 young people who have been out of work for more than six months and they do comprise a particular social challenge to the entire Australian community. The emphasis in the work for the dole approach will be on community cooperation&mdash;cooperation between community groups and local business organisations in rural and regional areas of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He says further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are quite deliberately providing as many incentives and as much encouragement as possible for small business in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I want to look at the last point he made. So much for the incentives such as the removal of the bounties&mdash;the ship bounties, book bounties and computer bounties. That really has done a lot for small business by providing an incentive to employ people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am curious about this point he makes about the cooperation of communities and small businesses, et cetera. I would have thought that in any region of Australia there has been a concerted effort on the part of all Australians to try to do something about youth unemployment. I think the Prime Minister and the government have to answer some questions. How is this going to work in terms of administration and accepting responsibility? The Prime Minister says we will have to amend the Social Security Act. How do you amend the Social Security Act for only part of the population who receive a benefit?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be very interesting to know how you are going to amend an act&mdash;if you are going to have a pilot program that is going to involve some 5,000 beneficiaries of the dole&mdash;in a way that it only goes to a certain number of people who receive a similar benefit. Surely that is discrimination at best. I would be very interested to hear the government explain how they are going to do that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to young people, it has been reported in the media that there is an expected cost&mdash;in addition to the money that they receive for the dole, for which they will work up to 20 hours a week depending on their age&mdash;of around $3,000 for each person. I am not sure for what period of time that will actually apply and for how long these young people will be expected to continue to work for the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At what point in time will they be able to achieve full-time work? Moreover, what effect will that have on full-time opportunities? Why wouldn't it be the case that businesses and/or even local government may choose to exploit a set of circumstances where people are required to work compulsorily for the dole when there are no jobs? In many regions of Australia there are no jobs. If there were jobs, people would be getting them now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot wave a magic wand and create jobs, particularly in some rural areas of this country, because of the very nature of the changes to the rural sector. We have seen the development of larger land holdings, and technology and plant and equipment has seen a significant decline in the number of job opportunities that come from farming. That then flows into the small rural centres where, simply because of the loss of wages revenue, there is decline in the number of jobs in service areas such as shops and other services that are provided within that community and other communities within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the government has some significant explaining to do as to how this will be the panacea, along with the green corps, which will only apply to a small number of people. It is focused on environmental repair and enhancement of the environment of this country. I am not quite sure what real benefit that will be in delivering training to people who seek to work in the areas of, say, information technology. Whilst there was some criticism of the schemes that we had in place, they were delivering. I will be very interested in whether or not this announcement was a major recommendation from the unemployment task force that the Prime Minister set up a while ago or whether or not they even knew about it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="491">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A whole host of other questions that I would like answered relate to how it is proposed to deal with workers' compensation, the supervision costs of these people and the issue of safety equipment and transport. They will still only get the dole. They will do 15 to 20 hours work, depending on their age. They will be confronted with additional costs, I would imagine, in transporting themselves, privately or publicly, to the employment that they will be required to do. What compensation will be made to them in those circumstances?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree that there probably is some community sentiment about this notion of work for the dole and the unemployed making some contribution. At the end of the day, given the criticism that the government made of our programs when it was in opposition, surely they have a responsibility&mdash;they claim that this is going to provide what we could not&mdash;to come into the parliament and explain how this program, announced by the Prime Minister, is going to work, how it will create opportunities for young people to get full-time jobs. I am quite sure they cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are so many questions I want to ask but, unfortunately, I do not have the time to go to them. I am sure that over the coming days we will pursue them and make sure that this government has not used this announcement to shield itself from some other pressing issues that still remain unanswered. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="491"><TITLE>Floods: South Australia</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to talk about the devastating floods in the north of South Australia and the effect that they are having not only on pastoral families but on the livestock that they farm in that area. The torrential rains that have fallen over the last week or so have been the heaviest in a decade. In fact, over the last 10 days they have received the equivalent of three or four years worth of rain. Almost half of the state's north has been affected. It is quite heartbreaking to learn that more rain is expected to come within the next couple of days. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I drove through that area just a couple of weeks ago, up towards Broken Hill and through the areas particularly affected. At that time they were looking like they always do at this time of the year&mdash;dry and dusty and, of course, very hot. Rain is always welcome in the pastoral countries but not of this quantity and not in this short period of time. The normally dry and quite dusty pastoral areas are seas of very muddy, turgid water. As some of us already know, the stock losses have been quite significant and the rain has damaged roads and the railway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The defence forces and the emergency services are standing by. Today they made food drops to some of the properties in the area that are particularly isolated and are likely to be without food for the next week or so. At this stage it is very difficult to assess the property damage in the area because there is still a great deal of water about, but it is likely to be between $60,000 and $100,000 per property. That is pretty devastating when one considers the difficulties that livestock farmers have been having with the wool prices and cattle prices as they are. With rain still falling and so much of the livestock roaming free in that area, at this stage it is very difficult to know what those final total figures might be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The railway line has been cut. I guess it is a bit of an irony that a couple of us were up in that area just 10 days ago looking at the future of the railway system, including the Indian Pacific line. We now have a situation where one of the trains is sitting up there and is likely to be there for several weeks yet.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator Collins&mdash;the unpredictability of the elements in this country. However, I understand that the passengers have enjoyed something of an unusual trip and have now been safely delivered to Adelaide. In fact, 20 roads have been cut in the area. The Birdsville and Oodnadatta tracks have been cut and 120 metres of the sealed road itself, as well as the bridges, have been washed out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may mean that tourists will not have access to this area until after Easter, which is another blow for an area which is just begin 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="492"> ning to develop a tourist industry. Many families are stuck in their homes but, of course, in this area that is nothing new. They are accustomed to a life of some adversity, and to be isolated is not unusual for them. In fact, I think many people who go to live up there prefer to stay there than come to the cities. I guess some of us can understand that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My understanding is that 55,000 livestock have been affected. But, as I say, it is difficult to know the final number at this stage. Yesterday, the Westpac helicopter took nine tourists from near Anna Creek, where further flooding threatens. There are 16 locals who have taken refuge in Anna Creek Homestead. I guess they expect to stay there to sit out the flood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the best example of the character that comes out in rural people with this sort of adversity can be seen at the William Creek pub, which is 1,000 kilometres north of Adelaide. It is currently accessible only by helicopter. Some of us may have heard the publican speaking on the radio yesterday. He said, `We're ankle&hyphen;deep in water. We've got stranded tourists and residents in here. We're a bit short on food. For a pub to run out of food is quite acceptable, but for a pub to run out of beer is definitely not on.' He says there is no danger of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of tourists who were in the area have found themselves painting the inside of the pub to pass the time away. As we know, pastoralists always look for the silver lining and, I guess, so does the local publican. He said, `We'll make do with what we've got, basically. It's bad at the moment but, in time, with water being in the lake and the wildflowers and so on, there'll be a plus side. We'll come out of it okay. That's the best way of looking at it. We'll try not to worry about the problems, but look to the future.' I think that is the sort of attitude that binds rural Australia. It is an attitude that comes out with adversity, whether it is floods, fire or difficulties with commodity prices. Somehow they always try to look to the future. I am pleased to see Senator Bob Collins agrees with me there.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is interesting to note that one of the more remote pastoralists said, `Well, it's a good thing the floods have come now and didn't happen in July. In the winter months our stock food is lower and we might lose more sheep.' A couple of the stations that are without electricity happily reported that they had barbecues by torchlight. I wonder if we in the city have quite that same sense of humour when our power goes off and we have difficulties with what we take for granted being just down the road and around the corner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the businesses that have been affected and which rely on tourism are optimistic that in due course charter flights will be taken up there to look at the wildflowers, the pelicans and all those other things that miraculously appear in the outback after rain. All I can say, and I am sure I speak on behalf of many of us, is that we hope there will not be too much more rain. We were pleased to hear Premier Olsen offering his support at this time when the floods are the worst in South Australia for a decade.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All governments of all political persuasions make good and bad decisions. At the end of the day, of course, you hope that the good decisions outnumber the bad ones. One of the bad decisions of the former Fraser government&mdash;in my view, one of the worst decisions&mdash;was to build this parliament house. It is not that I mind so much the $1&half; billion that was spent on this non&hyphen;functional polis; it is the fact that $1&half; billion was spent on building a structure when the architects had forgotten the primary purpose for which the building was designed&mdash;that is, a parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="493">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a great public monument&mdash;I concede that. It has got some very nice works of art in it that I like very much. It has got great big wide&hyphen;open public spaces that many people love to come and visit. But it is a non&hyphen;functional building as far as the parliament is concerned. Of course, everyone who works in it knows that; we knew that from day one. We found out very early when we moved in here that the acoustics of these billion dollar chambers were appalling. The debating chambers of a parliament, in my view, should be the focus of the architecture of a parliament. Everything should be built around the chambers. This, after all, is where the maximum amount of public attention is spent. But these chambers have got appalling acoustics. We found out shortly after we moved in. We had to spend a fortune. In fact, I was on the committee that determined to change all the electronics in here on which the sound depends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These chambers have no natural acoustics. They are awful. As I have said before, debating in here is like debating Darth Vader. It is all electronically controlled. You actually have to wait for about half a second before they can plug you in. You cannot get within striking distance of the enemy, which is what you should be able to do in a chamber built on the parliamentary system. Of course, you could do all that in the old parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What should have happened is that we should have restored Old Parliament House. We should have built an annex immediately behind it in the same successful way as they have done in Queensland. The state parliament of Queensland has one of the most magnificent pieces of restored built heritage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely beautiful. Senator Herron, you are right. It has a modern annex out the back. It has all of the history and beauty and tradition&mdash;and I am a traditionalist; I freely concede it&mdash;of an old Westminster parliament house, but it has provided the necessary office space at a fraction of the cost that this monstrosity has cost the Australian taxpayers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These chambers have got all of the atmosphere of a public toilet. If these chambers 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> remain here for 50 years they will never ever have any more atmosphere than a public toilet. That is not going to change with the years. This Parliament House was a billion dollar folly. I regret every working day of my life as a parliamentarian that we are here. I regret it so much that I have stopped going down to the old house, because on my first visit down there, after a year in here, when I went into those beautiful old chambers I was reminded of the intimacy of those chambers&mdash;how small they were in real terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What nonsense that you have to fit every single member of parliament into the chambers necessarily. The House of Commons does not have any problem with that and neither should we. What should have happened? We should have kept all of the history, all of the tradition, all of the beauty, all of the debating capacity of those old chambers, built an annex out the back and had decent office accommodation&mdash;and that would have happened at a fraction of the cost of this. This was a major error in my view, with the greatest respect to the Fraser government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that though, we should not add insult to injury. When we left Old Parliament House there were some loopy suggestions&mdash;and loopy they were&mdash;that we would tear off its foundations that magnificent Speaker's chair, which is modelled on the House of Commons Speaker's chair, in the old House of Representatives chamber where it is currently an adornment and carry it up the hill and put it in this art deco modern monstrosity where it would look frightful. I just thought it was the usual sort of loopy conservatism you get occasionally that makes no sense. But to my horror I found out tonight on the news that this is being seriously suggested again and that some idiot has actually spent $12,000 of hard&hyphen;earned taxpayers' money to have a consultant look at the possibility of doing it at a cost of $500,000.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I ask this madman, whoever he is, to cease and desist. Stop now! It is not the money I mind so much. We have already spent $1&half; billion on this monstrosity, so half a million dollars to wreck the history of the original chamber in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="494"> the House of Representatives I suppose is a flea bite compared to that. I did not realise they were serious. But the Speaker was on TV tonight saying, `Oh, yes. We have a consultant examining all this.' It is not the half a million dollars I mind; it is adding insult to injury.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is perfectly true that the Speaker's chair in the new Parliament House is not a thing of beauty and a joy forever. What that means is that it is completely in accord with the rest of the chamber. It is true that I have always personally thought that it looks like the backside of a departing tram&mdash;and it does&mdash;but that again makes it completely in accord with the unlovely chamber that it sits in. That beautiful piece of Gothic architecture&mdash;and I am sure that is probably wrong in technical terms; that lovely piece of architecture&mdash;the original Speaker's chair in the original chamber of the House of Representatives, would look totally incongruous in the modern chamber of the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three crimes would be committed at once at huge cost to the taxpayer. First of all, the historical significance of the Speaker's chair in the context of the chamber where it was placed and used would be destroyed utterly and at the same time insult the eye constantly by being completely incongruous in the modern setting in which it would be placed at a total cost to the taxpayer of half a million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that we all know there is a great big streak of truth in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS>. That is where it gets its humour from, exaggerated of course in real terms, but this would be a piece of folly that not even <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> contemplated and, I think, this would be folly against the built heritage of Australia. It would make this monstrosity even worse than it is now. But what is a worse crime is that it would sully the appearance and the historical importance of the original chamber of the House of Representatives which, with great respect, Mr Acting Deputy President, in my view is where we should still be debating this issue.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator Newman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The aircraft involved were Royal New Zealand Air Force No 2 Squadron A4 Skyhawks which are based at HMAS Albatross under the terms of the Australian/New Zealand Enhanced Nowra Agreement. This Agreement is in place for both countries to benefit from Maritime Strike and Maritime Air Defence training. The Agreement also allows for No 2 Squadron to conduct essential pilot training in the HMAS Albatross air training areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) No 2 Squadron A4 Skyhawks only operate in the air training areas above the National Park for very short periods, on an irregular basis, depending on training requirements. The average use of the training areas by</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No 2 Squadron is a total of one hour per month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) These exercises are conducted in the military controlled airspace above the National Park. In this case, it is designated Danger Area 423, which has been in use for 30 years. There is no specific policy for the use of airspace above wilderness areas for low flying. While some sensitive areas, such as Kakadu, have individual agreements in place to restrict and control low flying, there is no such agreement for any part of the Morton National Park. The nature of this training requires that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="501"> operations take place in mountainous terrain, and remote from urban and populated areas. Every effort is made to minimise the impact of flying on all environments. Furthermore, this activity is purposely conducted well away from populated areas to lessen the impact of noise on the wider Shoalhaven community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) (a) The department has not conducted research into the impacts of these flights on wildlife specifically in Morton National Park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) While no specific investigation has been conducted on the impact of very high sound pressures (noise) from low level flights of jet aircraft in the Morton National Park, studies have been conducted at RAAF Base Amberley and RAAF Base Darwin. These studies have specifically looked at the impact of noise on humans in urban areas. The very low frequency and duration of these flights over the Morton National Park means the likelihood of exhaust gases accumulating in and affecting the Park is considered to be remote. This view is supported by the evidently pristine nature of the Park which has allowed the declaration of the wilderness area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) There is no agreement between the Department and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of New South Wales (NSW) with regard to the use of Budawang Wilderness Area. However, the NPWS of NSW was advised in 1995 of the Department's requirement for continued use of the airspace above the National Park, and have subsequently raised no objections or concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The Government will consider suitable arrangements which ensure the relative priorities of both Defence and environmental requirements. However, many military training areas are purposely located in remote areas, some being national parks, in order that the impact of such training causes minimal impact on urban communities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will provide Capital Gains Tax (CGT) rollover relief to small and medium sized enterprises. To be eligible for rollover relief taxpayers must satisfy a number of tests, including that the net value of the taxpayer's assets must not exceed $5 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of meeting this test, an `asset' does not include, where the taxpayer is an individual who is not acting as a trustee, an asset for the personal use and enjoyment of the individual or an associate of the individual. As a result, if an individual has an expensive antique or art collection which is kept for the individual's personal use and enjoyment, then it will not be taken into account in determining whether the $5 million threshold is satisfied. The taxpayer will not be eligible for rollover relief on disposal of items from the antique or art collection, as these items are not active assets in the taxpayer's business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, different rules apply if an individual is acting as a trustee. For example, where a trust owns both business assets and other assets (such as antiques or works of art), the value of all of the assets owned by the trust will be taken into account in determining whether the $5 million threshold is satisfied.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QWN></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
