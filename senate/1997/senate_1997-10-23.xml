<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bolkus, by letter dated 21 October 1997, has raised a matter of privilege under standing order 81 and asked that precedence be given under that standing order to a motion relating to the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question he raises is whether two documents of the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund have been dealt with by the Attorney&hyphen;General, Mr Daryl Williams MP, the Special Minister of State, Senator Minchin, or Mr Warren Entsch MP, in a manner not authorised by the joint committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am required by the standing order to determine whether a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee should have precedence, having regard to the following criteria:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">(a) the principle that the Senate's power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions, and should not be used in respect of matters which appear to be of a trivial nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">(b) the existence of any remedy other than that power for any act which may be held to be a contempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Past presidential rulings have explained that a matter is given precedence if it is capable of being held by the Senate to meet criterion (a) and if there is no other readily available remedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unauthorised disclosure of committee documents is declared by the Senate's privilege resolutions to be a matter which may constitute a contempt of the Senate, and, in past precedents, allegations of such unauthor 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ised disclosure have been regarded as meeting the criteria for giving precedence to a motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a difficulty with the matter raised by Senator Bolkus, however. One of the persons named in Senator Bolkus's letter, Mr Entsch, is a member of the House of Representatives, and past presidential rulings have made it clear that the Senate cannot inquire into the conduct of a member of the House of Representatives, other than a minister acting in the capacity of a minister. Only the House of Representatives can inquire into the conduct of its members other than ministers acting in that capacity. Rulings to this effect were given by President Sibraa on 17 May 1988 and by President Beahan on 19 September 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although Mr Williams is a minister and may be taken to have been acting in that capacity in dealing with the documents in question, the evidence of his dealing with the documents is his disclosure of them in the course of proceedings in the House of Representatives. The Senate cannot inquire into proceedings in the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I therefore determine that precedence may be given to a motion relating to the matter raised by Senator Bolkus only in so far as it relates to unauthorised dealings with committee documents other than by members of the House of Representatives who are not ministers and other than in the course of proceedings in the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 20 June 1996 the Senate adopted a recommendation of the Privileges Committee that, in cases of unauthorised disclosure of committee documents, the committee concerned should in the first instance inquire into the disclosure and determine whether it had a tendency substantially to interfere with the work of the committee or of the Senate. The resolution adopting this procedure, however, explicitly does not prevent a Senator raising a matter of privilege under standing order 81 in the absence of such an inquiry and determination by the committee concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Senator Bolkus decides to exercise his right to give a notice of motion, the notice must be framed so as to make it clear that any inquiry by the Privileges Committee does not extend to the conduct of members of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7902"> House of Representatives other than ministers acting in the capacity of ministers or to proceedings in the House of Representatives. I table Senator Bolkus's letter and attachments.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>

Unfortunately, as I understand the divisions which are taking place, the Wik matter is one of those matters. Hopefully that time will not be broken by other activities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is committed to improving waterfront reliability and productivity to enhance job prospects, exports and economic growth for the benefit of all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In May last year, just a few months after the election, expressions of interest were invited from a number of relevant consultants to provide advice `regarding an industrial relations strategy for the implementation of waterfront reform'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ACIL Economics and Policy Pty Ltd was selected because of their extensive experience in waterfront reform, including having conducted two reviews in New Zealand, and their involvement with a range of export industries. ACIL had also subcontracted with First IR Pty Ltd, a firm with an intimate knowledge of the new industrial relations landscape encompassed in the Workplace Relations Bill that was introduced into parliament late last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consultants submitted a report finalising the consultancy on 18 September 1996. The report was commissioned to assist the government's consideration of waterfront reform. The awarding of this contract was listed in the government <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> in 1996, and in supplementary information to the 1995&hyphen;96 annual report of the Department of Transport and Regional Development, also published in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ACIL have also recently been engaged to provide advice on options to improve the reliability and productivity of the services provided by the waterfront industries. ACIL were engaged for this project at the direction of the former Minister for Transport and Reg 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7912"> ional Development, based on official advice that a tendering process can be forgone where there is a need for a particular consultant to further develop or enhance a task previously carried out by that consultant and which requires special knowledge and familiarity with the previous task. This advice was drawn from that department's supply manual, which was issued on 11 July 1995 under the previous Labor government when Mr Brereton was the minister for transport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contract with ACIL provides for expenditures of up to $600,000, which allows for the potential use of subcontractors. Again, the consultancy was listed in the government <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> and the information was provided to Senator O'Brien in a response to a question on notice. The opposition has already asked questions about these consultancies in the estimates committee hearings in August 1997 and has been provided with relevant information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are five categories of documents included in Senator O'Brien's motion. Part (a) seeks all documents relating to the tender and awarding of the consultancy contract to ACIL economics on or about 15 May 1996 relating to waterfront reform. These tender documents were provided to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee in response to a question taken on notice at its hearings on 20 August 1997. A further copy of these documents will be provided if required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other documents relating to the awarding of the consultancy contract involve a comparative assessment of bidders as well as the tender proposals of the bidders. These were provided in confidence. If these are to be released, either publicly or on a restricted basis, to Senator O'Brien, privacy considerations would require prior contact with the affected organisations to obtain approval. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) is prepared to contact the relevant parties to seek their permission to release all or part of the documents relating to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part (b) of the motion seeks the report arising from the contract awarded to ACIL Economics on or about 15 May 1996. This 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> report is classified commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence and cabinet&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence and contains advice to assist the government's contribution to waterfront reform. The report is part of the deliberative processes involved in the functions of the government, and disclosure would be contrary to the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cabinet has discussed the development of the government's policy on waterfront reform. The development of policies relating to waterfront and shipping reform is of national economic importance. Disclosure of the report could damage relations with the states, as some information contained in the report was provided in confidence by state governments. There is also the potential that disclosure could endanger the physical safety of a person or persons. Accordingly, the government will be claiming public interest immunity in relation to the disclosure of this document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part (c) of the motion seeks the terms of reference for the contract awarded to ACIL Economics on or about 20 June 1997 relating to the waterfront reform and all related documents. The minister is prepared to table the terms of reference for the contract, and I table that document now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part (d) of the motion seeks a list of all organisations contacted by ACIL Economics pursuant to the contracts let to it on or about 15 May 1996 and 20 June 1997. The list of organisations contacted for the 1996 ACIL project is part of the ACIL report. Knowledge of specific persons or entities visited could adversely affect the commercial interests of those named, and may also endanger the physical safety of persons. Full details of contacts under the 1997 ACIL project will form part of the report that has not yet been received. However, when the report is received, it can be expected to be treated in the same manner as the 1996 report. Accordingly, the government will claim public interest immunity in relation to these documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final part of the motion seeks a list of all sites visited and travel undertaken by ACIL Economics pursuant to the contracts let to it on or about 15 May 1996 and 20 June 1997. The list of sites visited for the 1996 project is part of the ACIL report. Knowledge 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7913"> of specific persons or entities visited could adversely affect the commercial interests of those named and may also endanger the physical safety of persons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The full extent of visits under the 1997 project will be part of the report, which has not been received as yet. However, when the report is received, it can be expected to be treated in the same manner as the 1996 report. Accordingly, the government will claim public interest immunity in relation to these documents. Information on interstate travel undertaken is provided for the purposes of reimbursement of costs and is recorded only at the level of the city visited. It would not be an effective use of departmental resources to collate this information and, to the extent that it has any relevance, it could identify specific persons or entities visited and adversely affect their privacy or commercial interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACIL projects are part of the advice to government on maritime issues. The former Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, commissioned a number of consultancies to provide research and advice on maritime matters. In addition to ACIL he, through the department, engaged Dr Stephen Webster to prepare a report with the assistance of six other contractors. Five of these contracts were notified in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> on 19 September 1997, and one will be notified in the normal course of events later this month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Webster's report was presented on 3 October 1997. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), as the minister now responsible for maritime matters, is currently considering the report. As with the ACIL documents, this report will be a valuable input into the government's development of policies in the maritime sector and will likewise be subject to public interest immunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reform on the waterfront must be realised for the benefit of all Australians. We will not allow this objective to be placed in jeopardy by the premature release of documents which are inputs to our deliberative processes.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been outstanding for some time, and those matters were not drawn to our attention before this morning's revelation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the other comments that the Minister representing the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business made, it is important that it be on the record, prior to a determination of this motion, that until the demise of the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, there was within the department a well&hyphen;resourced division&mdash;the Maritime Division.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This reform program has been under way for some time, so it has to be said that there is not only expertise within that division but also experience. Despite this, the government chose to pay a consultant nearly $700,000 over the last year and this year to develop a strategy for reform on the waterfront&mdash;or that is what we are told.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Information on that matter has properly been sought at the Senate estimates process, but the government has, to date, denied the information available and, only this morning, has advised the availability of certain of that information. But the government continues to indicate it does not wish to produce all the information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Maritime Division&mdash;this properly resourced division; a part of the Department of Transport and Regional Development&mdash;has now been moved from its natural home into the Department of Industrial Relations. It is, in the opposition's view, a bizarre process which, as I said yesterday, indicates that the only transport policy this government has is to attack the Maritime Union. But, rather than get into that process, what we in the Estimates process are entitled to observe is the relevance of the advice sought, given the resourcing of this government, of a division which has, as I understand it, an annual budget of $62 million to conduct the necessary process of advising government. Yet we are advised that a further $700,000 in consultancy fees are being or have been paid to ACIL Economics to assist the government to prepare policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the opposition's view that we are entitled to scrutinise the expenditure of this $700,000 and to judge its worth, as are the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7914"> people of Australia. We indicate that we are opposing the government's view on retaining the secrecy of these documents.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator O'Brien said, it was the first time that he had heard these matters and these questions raised against the provision of information. It is certainly the first time that I have heard of that. It concerns me that the government says that supply of this information to the Senate may endanger presumably the life and safety of certain individuals. That is a matter which we must all be interested in and concerned about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I think that ought to be tested in some way. I am not sure that we ought not look at whether the matters raised in the minister's statement are of such a nature as should prevent us from proceeding with a demand that these be tabled. That could be done in the upcoming estimates committee meetings and in the consideration of the matter afterwards or, alternatively, it could be referred to another committee, whereby the chair and deputy chair of that committee would be able to assess whether or not the statements that have been made by the minister were of such importance that the information and, in particular, the report should not be provided to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think we should let go of the request that has been made. I note that Senator O'Brien indicated that it was the first time he had heard of those sorts of protections, and I presume it is the first time anybody around here has heard of them as well. At present, I suggest that perhaps we should defer the motion to another day, and then perhaps senators can consider a way of dealing with this matter so that we are not prevented by executive government action from obtaining information and documentation from the executive government, as we have done time and time again over the many years that this demand for presentation of documents has been made in the Senate&mdash;and that has been for the 21 or 22 years that I have been here.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill establishes the new Farm Family Restart Scheme and the exceptional circumstances relief payment for farm families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill introduces an important element of the government's integrated rural policy, "Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia" which will help to build a competitive, sustainable and profitable rural sector. The measures introduced in this bill will ensure farm families experiencing financial hardship have equitable access to welfare support. The rural sector accounts for a major share of Australia's exports and provides the basis for much of the nation's value adding food and fibre processing industries. Its economic health and profitability is vital to the future prosperity of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rural sector has faced unprecedented challenges in recent years. While the top 20 per cent of farm businesses are performing well, data collated by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Economics show the sector as a whole has endured a long period of negative profitability. Severe drought, low commodity prices and cost pressures, particularly in the farm finance market, have created a very difficult operating environment for farm businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, my intention is not to talk down the sector and paint too gloomy a picture; it is simply to acknowledge the circumstances our farmers have and in many cases continue to endure. Their resilience in the face of adversity is indeed admirable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is, however, another side to the coin, for while there are challenges to be overcome, there is no poverty of opportunity for our farmers. They are efficient, competitive producers of high quality, clean food and fibre. They are ideally positioned to capture the significant opportunities presented by the rapid growth of Asian food markets and international trade reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much has already been done by the government to position rural Australia to succeed in the years ahead. Our preparedness to reign in government expenditure and put the Commonwealth budget on track for surplus, together with broader micro&hyphen;economic reforms in areas such as the labour market, are good news for agriculture. The maintenance of low inflation and continuing reductions in real interest rates have allowed real progress to be made in reducing business input costs and provided a boost to Australia's international competitiveness through the resulting devaluation of the Australian dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While much has been done to get the big picture right, there is more still this government can do to help secure the foundations of Australian agriculture. This bill is about investing substantial resources where it matters, just as the government has done through the Natural Heritage Trust and in areas such as quarantine and meat inspection reform. Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia is a comprehensive package with four key objectives; firstly, to help farm businesses profit from change; secondly, to provide positive incentives for ongoing farm adjustment; thirdly, to encourage social and economic development in rural areas and fourthly, and very importantly, to ensure the farm sector has access to an adequate welfare safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia" is the direct result of many government initiated reviews of rural policy which have been conducted over the past 18 months. These reviews have drawn on the expertise and experiences of many involved in the rural industry. Extensive consultation with state and territory governments, farmer groups and the public has contributed significantly in shaping the measures introduced today. The initiatives in this bill the farm family restart scheme and the exceptional circumstances relief payment, have received 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7916"> widespread endorsement from key farming bodies such as the National Farmers' Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the past, the interrelationship between rural welfare and business policy objectives has not been fully appreciated. In a sense, the integration of family life and welfare with the management of the farm business has been taken for granted. This interrelationship needs to be recognised in addressing the welfare needs of farming families. It is imperative that we do if we are to ensure the current transition in outlook from the family farm to the family farm business runs to a successful conclusion. This means also that welfare measures need to be distinct from measures targeted at improving the profitability of farming businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill has been carefully designed to meet the coalition's long standing commitment to address these important welfare issues, while, at the same time, taking account of the uniqueness of family farm business structures, and the vulnerability of farming families to natural events.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just as importantly, the measures contained in this bill offer carefully targeted assistance to those who wish to adjust out of farming. Additionally, it provides income support for those farm families who find themselves suffering financial hardship as a result exceptional circumstances which are beyond their capacity to manage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the new Farm Family Restart Scheme is the government's key program for delivering income support to the farm sector. It also provides adjustment assistance to farmers who wish to leave the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments offer an innovative approach to assisting farm families. This legislation provides farmers with the opportunity to give serious consideration to the future of the farm and family without having to rush decisions. It recognises that it takes time to come to grips with the possibility of a future that does not entail farm ownership. It allows them to keep working the farm while they review their situation. It relieves the tremendous pressure than can arise from literally not being able to put food on the table.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Farm Family Restart Scheme will provide a decision support system for farmers considering exiting the industry as well as those who need the breathing space to re&hyphen;focus their farm enterprise. This scheme provides access to professional advice to farmers to help them assess the future viability of their business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Farm Family Restart Scheme will begin on 1 December 1997. I will now provide the house with details of the features of the new scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Income support will be provided to low income farmers who cannot borrow further against their assets. This support will be equivalent to the Newstart Allowance, plus Partner Allowance where 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> appropriate. Very importantly, it does not require the farm family to put the farm on the market or undergo an activity test as would be the case if they were seeking support through the social security system. This support will be available to eligible farmers for up to one year;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recipients will face an obligation to obtain professional advice on the future viability of the farm business, as well as ongoing professional advice to assist the family focus on either re&hyphen;building the business where this is possible, or leaving the industry. The government will provide financial support to the farm family to access this professional advice, which may include career counselling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A re&hyphen;establishment grant of up to $45,000 will be available to eligible farmers. This grant will provide positive incentives for farmers to leave farming before their assets are severely depleted. I emphasise that eligible farmers will be able to apply for the re&hyphen;establishment grant only during the first two years of the operation of the Farm Family Restart Scheme. To receive the grant, those who apply and meet the eligibility criteria will need to sell their farm within twelve months of ceasing income support, or from the date of their application if income support is not sought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The re&hyphen;establishment grant will be subject to a more generous assets test than past re&hyphen;establishment grants, but any income support provided under the Farm Family Restart Scheme will be deducted from the grant. The new assets test will allow farmers to have up to $90,000 in assets to qualify for the maximum grant. The grant will phase down by $2 for every $3 in assets above this threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Farmers who have accessed the scheme for less than six months and withdraw will be eligible to apply to rejoin the scheme, to complete the twelve months. Farmers who withdraw from the scheme after six months will not be able to rejoin. Support paid under this scheme will be provided as a grant&mdash;not as a loan scheme, which was proven ineffective under the former government's farm household support scheme. It resulted in low income farmers incurring debts to the government which they simply did not have the capacity to repay. This government has, of course, decided to wipe the slate clean in this regard and write off these debts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the Farm Household Support Act 1992 is also being amended to introduce the exceptional circumstances relief payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exceptional circumstances relief payment will be an income support payment available to farmers in areas declared to be in exceptional circumstances. Its rate of payment will also be equivalent to the newstart allowance, plus partner allowance where appropriate. It will be subject to the same income and off&hyphen;farm assets tests that apply to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7917"> drought relief payment to ensure it is targeted to farm families who are experiencing financial hardship as a result of the exceptional circumstance. The exceptional circumstances relief payment will be equivalent to and replace the current drought relief payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exceptional circumstances relief payment gives recognition to the fact that there are exceptional circumstances which are beyond the scope of normal farm risk management strategies. It will be available to farmers suffering financial hardship as a result of rare and severe events including, but not restricted to, extreme drought. It will allow farming families to focus on the task of managing their businesses in circumstances which are challenging enough without the added burden of worrying about how they will meet their day to day living costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The duration of this payment will be determined on a case by case basis according to the nature of the declared exceptional circumstance. A 12 months recovery period will continue to apply for exceptional drought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Farmers currently in drought exceptional circumstances areas, and receiving the drought relief payment, will progressively move to the exceptional circumstances relief payment. As their drought exceptional circumstances certificates expire, they will be issued with exceptional circumstances certificates. Farmers completing their recovery period for the drought relief payment or reaching the end of exceptional circumstances relief payment support will be eligible to apply for the Farm Family Restart Scheme if they wish to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will honour its commitments under the rural adjustment scheme. Farmers will still be able to apply for re&hyphen;establishment assistance under the rural adjustment scheme, until 30 November 1997. This will provide a smooth transition to the new Farm Family Restart Scheme when it commences on 1 December 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, this bill is an essential element in the government's rural policy platform. It is closely linked to other measures in the Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia package which will help to maximise the sector's contribution to the economic, social and environmental well&hyphen;being of the nation, especially rural and regional communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned until the first sitting day in 1998, in accordance with standing order 111.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The amendments we will have before us throughout this debate are primarily technical. As I outlined in my speech on the second reading, I have adopted the approach of accepting, by and large, a technical approach, unless issues have emerged subsequent to the passage of the act which attempt to put the act into some difficulty in any area or unless issues are fundamental to the nature of industrial relations as it is at present. My view, as the Senate well knows, is that we should seek to ensure that the new act has time to be bedded down and not succumb to the drive, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7918"> particularly from the right, to advance the cause of major reduction in the provisions available to both workers and employers through the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, my amendment No. 1 refers to a situation which has arisen in Western Australia which goes against the fundamental principles and purpose of the act. The act says that workers and employers and their respective organisations should be free to choose the jurisdiction under which they seek to operate either at the state or the federal level. It also implies that anyone doing so should be free to do so; in other words, they should not be constrained by pursuing their legal and legitimate activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister Graham Kierath, a Liberal member of the coalition government in Western Australia, introduced a law in Western Australia which was known as the second wave of reforms. He shovelled it through the upper house&mdash;and that is probably a polite term&mdash;before the members of that upper house changed on 22 May this year consequent to the Western Australian election on 16 December 1996. The change in the upper house would have meant that he would have been unable to get through some of the more hairy&hyphen;chested and draconian measures he put forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the measures Minister Kierath put forward which has in fact passed into law in Western Australia is that, in the event of a workers' or an employers' organisation making an application to move into the federal system through a process&mdash;and the process has a number of steps&mdash;that ends with the minister, it is possible for that organisation's ability to operate under the state system to be ended whilst the application is being considered; in other words, the organisation cannot continue to maintain its state awards or respond to the nature of the agreement or negotiate improvements to the state awards. Frankly, we think that is wrong. We think that goes against the morality of the act and against freedom of choice and the ability to go about ones business in industrial relations, which should be the right of every worker, every employer and every organisation that relates to them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate and those who are experienced in the issues of union operations would be aware that it can take many years to move from a state to a federal jurisdiction. I have been told that it can take as long as four years. So you hardly want to have no ability to care for your workers under the state system in the meantime. This amendment seeks to fast&hyphen;track the ability of the Industrial Relations Commission to consider an application to move from the state to the federal system where respondency to existing state awards or agreements has been impaired as a result of state law. To do that the commission would have to evade somewhat the restrictive nature of section 111AAA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would never dream of proposing that except in circumstances where people's rights have been unfairly and unnecessarily constrained, as they have in the Western Australian situation. Of course, that disease could spread to other governments and therefore we have not particularised this amendment to Western Australia. But we do think it is appropriate. We do not think it is an ideological issue or a philosophical issue. We think it is an issue of fairness and morality. In fact it is an attempt to make sure that the provisions we have within the bill about freedom of choice are respected by state governments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to pass a few comments in respect of this amendment proposed by Senator Murray and to indicate my thoughts that it is a most worthwhile amendment on his part. In a former life I was involved with a major trade union in Western Australia which was in the process of engaging in a range of negotiations on behalf of its members with a range of firms, some national, some medium sized and some local. A range of those firms, for reasons relating to business practice, indicated that they wished to switch their method of operation from regulation under the Western Australian state system and the Western Australian common rule awards that applied in that state, to the federal system, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7919"> either under federal awards or, as it was in those days, federal certified agreements. We did not have a particular concern whether an award agreement or enterprise bargain was regulated either in the federal system or the state system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more recent amendments passed by the Court government in Western Australia have had the effect that, where trade unions negotiate enterprise bargaining agreements or certified agreements, whatever they are currently called, with employers and seek to have them regulated under the law in the federal system, the union that does that, and that shifts its members by consent or through the arbitral process out of the state system to the federal system, can be penalised for doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray indicated he thought it was an issue of correctness or right or wrong, and not so much an ideological or philosophical issue. I would disagree with him on that point. The effect was that trade unions and employers who negotiated agreements that suited their mutual and joint interests to change the system of regulation from either federal to state or from state to federal, as was the case from time to time, were punished, notwithstanding the fact that they operated within their rules with the interests of their members as a priority and consistent with the interests of the particular firm or firms involved in that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, having achieved that purpose by agreement, the state system was changed to deny that union coverage of a former group of workers when they had consented to go into the federal system for their own purposes. This strikes me as being an ideological pursuit carried to the extreme. On occasion, that shift from federal to state or state to federal was pursued via arbitral process before an independent tribunal. All of the evidence was placed before the tribunal and it made a decision on merit, having regard to the sense or otherwise of the argument put forward by the respective organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again in that case, when that arbitral process was pursued, the government in that state passed laws that restricted the rights of that organisation to protect those members 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and other members under the state system. To the extent that Senator Murray's amendment seeks to overcome that evil, it is a most worthwhile endeavour as far as I am concerned and, as far as the opposition is concerned, it is worthy of support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition is opposed to this amendment. We are quite sure, and I am sure Senator Murray would not deny this, that it is designed purely to punish one state and to discriminate against one state's industrial laws, and that is the state of Western Australia where Senator Murray, Senator Bishop and I come from. We believe, firstly, it is inappropriate to include this sort of amendment in a technical bill. In any event, the Workplace Relations Act already requires the commission to deal with matters as quickly as practicable, and provision is made for the commission to make interim awards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Bishop said that it was indeed a philosophical issue. I think Senator Murray tried to say it was not philosophically or ideologically driven but just a technical thing. If that is the case, Senator Murray, well technically, the commission is required to deal with matters as quickly as possible anyway. I think Senator Bishop is being more frank about this. It is an ideological and philosophical attack on the Western Australian government's industrial laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that Senator Bishop and Senator Murray share an ideological opposition to those industrial laws, but they are a matter for the state parliament of Western Australia. To seek to interfere, in what is, I think, a fairly obvious if not blatant attack on that state parliament's decision to pass those laws with what is clearly, as is even agreed by the ACTU, a technically amending bill&mdash;a tidying up bill; a bit of housekeeping&mdash;is entirely inappropriate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a technical amendment. It has arisen as a result of a problem of interpretation and understanding which has emerged within the Industrial Relations Commission between the Department of Industrial Relations and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. I say it is technical but, of course, I am aware of how important it is. It goes to an issue which is fairly fundamental. Accordingly, I will need to return to the message which I put across in my speech in the second reading debate which concerns this amendment. I referred to it as a material technical amendment, which is probably the best way I could describe it. It deals with the issue of collective bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have always said that collective bargaining protects the weak and vulnerable in our society from those with strength. A key issue has always been the protection afforded to Australian workers and, I happen to believe, Australian employers as a result of Australia's long commitment and adherence to its international obligations under ILO conventions. Those ILO conventions&mdash;as Labor senators would know better than anyone&mdash;prefer collective bargaining over individual bargaining in areas where those who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7921"> do the individual bargaining are in an inferior or a weakened bargaining situation. We all fought very hard over that last year and we did get as much of our international obligations back into that act as we felt we could.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had several meetings with the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business on this particular issue last year. We were persuaded by the minister and his staff that the bill did indeed prefer collective bargaining over individual bargaining. In particular, the minister's office pointed to the fact that under section 170LA the Industrial Relations Commission has a positive duty to facilitate the making of collective certified agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I received advice that it is important to appreciate that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will have extensive conciliation powers to facilitate the negation of certified agreements which may include, for example, ordering the parties to attend compulsory conferences. Indeed, under section 170LA, the AIRC is required, as far as practicable, to perform its function in such a way as to facilitate the making of certified agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In dealing with a situation where employers want to bargain individually and workers want to bargain collectively&mdash;in other words, where there is a difference in opinion as to how they want to be dealt with&mdash;I was further advised that such employees would have a number of options open to them. In particular, they could initiate a bargaining period for a certified agreement and they could also appoint their union as their bargaining agent. If the employer still wished to negotiate an agreement he would have to deal with the union. The union and the employer would then have to negotiate whether any agreement was to be in the form of a collective AWA or a certified agreement. The employees would be able to act collectively and would be able to take protective action. They would also seek the assistance of the Industrial Relations Commission to facilitate a certified agreement if they wished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that we in the Senate were absolutely in support of employees and employers pursuing individual agreements where both are willing and both feel that this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is the best course. I am not supportive of a situation where workers in an inferior bargaining position who wish to bargain collectively would be obliged or forced to take up individual agreements. It is plainly their right to be able to negotiate collectively, and it is a right that has been recognised throughout the civilised world. That is how we understood the bill would operate. We understood that workers could not be forced&mdash;and I use the word `forced' so you understand my meaning&mdash;by their employers to bargain individually.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened in the Hunter region is that the Industrial Relations Commission essentially said to us all, `We know that you have 170LA. We think we know what that says, but we are uncertain as to the intention of government.' The government took, in our view, a harder line than that which we had understood to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is our intention, through this material technical amendment, to make it clear that where a third party is required&mdash;throughout our law it is consistent that a third party is frequently required; we take it as axiomatic that if there is a problem you can refer to an arbitrator, a court or a conciliator and that is throughout the basis of our contractual dealings&mdash;it should be axiomatic that the Industrial Relations Commission, with the constitutional imperative that it enjoys, feel obliged and able, in terms of the act and particularly in terms of 170LA, to enter a dispute where the issue is incapable of resolution in any other way. The government may not agree with that interpretation, but it was certainly the interpretation that we believed, and I have been at pains to be very particular with the wording that I have used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We propose a technical amendment to give the commission the power to make any orders that it deems necessary to fulfil its statutory obligations to facilitate the making of certified agreements and collective bargaining where the workers or the employers need that device activated. Such orders would not extend to stopping protected action, as the act clearly intended such action to be protected, but such orders could extend to prevent the predatory offering or approval of AWAs, for example, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7922"> or other punitive action by employers against unions and workers wanting and needing to bargain collectively. That is the nub of our case. I hope the Senate will recognise that it is a material technical amendment designed to give a message to the AIRC that, when other means are not before it, it does have the powers it should.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst the opposition will not be supporting the amendment, we do appreciate the logic behind the Democrats' position and also the motivation behind the amendment. The difficulty from our perspective is that, in attempting to attend to one particular problem with an amendment of such breadth, other areas of concern might be opened up unintentionally. For example, we are concerned that there may be some unforseen ramifications and difficulties with it. To use Senator Murray's example with regard to Rio Tinto, this could actually be used by Rio Tinto to gain damage orders against workers' agents and their representatives. However, I did indicate that we are sympathetic to it, and we do understand the types of difficulties that Senator Murray has addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, our concern is that the amendment is too broad, and we are dealing with a specific example that Senator Murray has alluded to. The difficulty there is that, if the government had agreed to the AIRC moving to compulsory arbitration with regard to that example, this problem would never have arisen in the first place. So we believe the difficulty in that situation is a lack of political will on the part of the government.

<PARA STYLE="Para">We believe the government's amendment will affect the rights of new employees in the workplace who are considering whether or not they will sign up to a certified agreement. We believe the government's amendment will effectively reduce the period for those employees who commence work after the 14 days begins. It is aimed at ensuring that the 14-day time period does not have to recommence if a new employee begins work during that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our concern with regard to this first amendment is that a lesser period should occur as a right; for example, at least seven days, unless the commission determines otherwise. We believe that a new employee coming on does need to have a reasonable amount of time to consider a certified agreement, which has the potential to affect them for years with regard to their working environment and the wages and conditions that they work under. However, we are sympathetic to the position that we do not want the timeline pushed out too far, but there is the capacity for the commission to approve a lesser period with regard to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To sum up, whilst we do have some sympathy with the government's position, we do see that in extreme circumstances workers may, in fact, have very short periods to determine whether or not they are prepared to sign up to a certified agreement. We think seven days is reasonable. As I said, if there is any suggestion of vexatious or frivolous activity, then the AIRC does have the capacity to come in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7923"> and say, `No, this is not appropriate.' However, we do not believe that the government's amendment is fair in terms of new workers coming on during that period. So, again, it is an attempt on our part to ensure that people are given adequate time to determine the effect of a certified agreement on them and to give their concurrence or otherwise to it.</PARA></SPEECH>

We should remember that the government is always saying, `We are giving people more choices', but we have to ascertain whether there have been choices in fact or whether the agreements have been forced on people.</PARA>

Firstly, there are very few circumstances, if any, where a federal award does not apply. Secondly, in the very few instances where there are no federal awards, there are similar awards which could apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that this is not a technical amendment in that it may allow a serious diminution of effect with regard to the no disadvantage test in the scrutiny of AWAs by allowing a state award to be used which may be lower with regard to wages and conditions than a federal award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have serious difficulties and differences across the various states in relation to state awards. We believe it is appropriate to provide the federal benchmark. At this point, I indicate that the opposition believes there is already a situation where the no disadvantage test breaches the government's pre&hyphen;election commitment that no worker would be worse off. That situation is occurring where the Employment Advocate is ignoring, in terms of the application of the no disadvantage test, areas where there are agreements, and areas where workers are operating under minimum awards rather than paid rates awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From our perspective, there is already a serious divide with regard to what workers were getting under the old industrial relations system and the way that the no disadvantage test is being applied by the Employment Advocate. There is already a gap emerging

Here, where we have state awards forming the standard, we really are going back by using a federal constitution to entrench, as it were, the state system, because the states individually are now able to set the standards for how a person in that particular state will operate.</PARA></TALK.START>

But the general spirit of how industrial relations was conducted in the founding fathers' era has passed. Is that a good thing?

<PARA STYLE="Para">The effect of the government amendments is that employees under federal awards, certified agreements and AWAs will not be able to access state provisions in laws or awards, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> such as severance pay or redundancy . We oppose the time limit imposition of 21 days on a union applying to the AIRC on behalf of an employee over an employer's decision to sack a worker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While accepting government items 4 and 5, we are opposing the rest for the following reasons. Firstly, from our perspective, the government is keeping workers' rights as confined as possible. The government is concerned that workers may be able to access beneficial state legislation awards on termination, and obviously that is something that the government would not support. We believe it is important that workers have access to either jurisdiction, and that their access not be restricted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, with regard to the time limit imposed on a union, we believe, as I indicated before, that the amendment's effect is too restrictive. Currently, there is no time limit imposed on unions. I would like to indicate that there are a number of reasons why we believe that 21 days is too restrictive. You may have a situation where a large number of employees are terminated at once, which is quite possible; it has happened many times in Australia's current industrial climate. In fact, quite recently 1,000 workers were terminated. Twenty&hyphen;one days is simply not adequate for the preparation of a case as to whether the termination was unjust, harsh and unlawful. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, you may have a situation wherein a worker who is a member of a union is sacked, but may not be aware of his or her rights in that respect. It may take some time for that person to say, `Well, look, I believe in retrospect, having thought about this, that I was terminated unjustly. I'd better get down to the union to see whether I've got a case.' This can often take in excess of 21 days. I think Arco is probably the best recent example of the situation with mass sackings. Given the industrial relations climate, we are likely to see more en masse sackings occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each unfair dismissal has to be filed individually, and there is currently no capacity for what could be termed `class actions'. Here again, we believe that 21 days is too limiting because of the procedural aspects surrounding applications. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7931">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate the difficulties that arise when workers are sacked en masse, quite often for different reasons&mdash;it may not be for reasons such as inadequate productivity or a diminution in the bottom line in terms of profit, but it could be for different reasons. Quite often&mdash;as Senator Cooney would be aware&mdash;these are very complex cases in terms of establishing whether it is harsh, unjust and unlawful. We believe that the current provisions should apply with regard to no time limit.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Mackay has convinced me yet again. In a sense, this is not an issue of industrial law but an issue of common law. The basis for employment is contracts between the employer and the employee&mdash;workplace contracts. Normally, the time limit that applies to a breach of contract is six years. Why 21 days has been chosen in what really is a common law action is a very interesting question. I do not know where the 21 days comes from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This provision is aimed, I think, at getting more summonses or writs issued. If you are a lawyer, what you ought to do as soon as anybody is sacked is simply issue a writ to make sure that you are not sued for negligence. Why there would be a provision like this seems extraordinary, as Senator Mackay said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are a worker, you would have firstly to recover from the shock, and then get proper advice and proceedings taken. You would probably be better off if you were in a union because you would go straight to the union and it would get in touch with its solicitors. Even though workers in a union would be disadvantaged, they would not be as disadvantaged as workers who did not have a union to look to and who were trying to recover from the very nasty shock of being sacked.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is it that, if there is a breach of contract between a bank and a big business house, that breach of contract is alive, in terms of taking action upon it, for six years?

However, a worker, usually someone on reasonably low wages, who has no legal advice, no accountant and no experience must get that application in within 21 days, and if the person does not, that is the end of him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure seems to me to be quite extraordinary. It is against the very common law that we are supposed to be operating under and against this new business of bargaining where the marketplace decides. If the marketplace decides, why shouldn't the time limitations that generally operate in the marketplace&mdash;that is, six years&mdash;operate for the worker?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking to that, I indicate that the Senate may wish to have regard to a recent CEPU application to the Industrial Commission on this matter, whereby the commission itself determined that there was no need for these clauses to be removed.

We believe that, given that they do not have any effect anyway, there is no reason to pretend that they never existed. We believe&mdash;to use some of Senator Campbell's own justification on other matters&mdash;that it is an unnecessary waste of time, money and effort.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With regard to the question of the right of entry, I think that one of the problems is the concept that is behind it&mdash;that is, that the union and the union official is going into the workplace to cause trouble or at least to provide a focus for friction. I think that the issue that Senator Mackay has raised is a central one. Senator Murray says that it is not a technical issue, which is true, and therefore it should not be discussed&mdash;that is probably putting it too strongly&mdash;and allowed to go through. Senator Mackay has raised an issue which needs to be looked at by this parliament at this stage. The nature of the union and its relationship with employees ought to be looked at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conduct of the union and its officials is underpinned by the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and the various acts which came before it. The union is an organisation elected by its members. Its officials are subject to the ballot box every four years. I think that has to be taken into account when you look at this particular problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would seem to me that&mdash;where the idea is for the work force and management to bring flexibility and choice into the workplace&mdash;an organisation which is freely and democratically elected every four years by a group of workers ought to be taken into account. It is only right and proper that any organisation which goes about its functions in a lawful, reasonable and measured way ought to be able to recruit and to see how workplaces are operating. If they try to cause disturbances or break the law then, certainly, they should not be allowed into the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the great British traditions that underpin this nation&mdash;and the concept of the union, the concept of the free association of people who work, is a very English concept&mdash;why shouldn't a freely elected body be able to take its proper place in society and go in at an appropriate time and in an appropriate way and speak to people who are in the workplace? The unions can put forward to workers the proposition that they might find it useful to be part of an organisation that tries to get fairness in wages and conditions&mdash;not only in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7939"> wages and conditions but in the way the system operates. I think more and more the position is clear that the union movement wants to see a productive and a forward thinking industry in Australia. It is a matter of cooperation. Their function is also to see that those people are properly protected by a system that they elect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a real tragedy that the perception in industrial relations is that the union is there to simply aggravate the situation. I think it is the same sort of false concept we would have if we thought that employer organisations were simply there to grind down workers and to make difficulties. We would not have that concept at all. We would be saying that these organisations are there to see that industry is not only run profitably and that production is at its highest level but also that the workplace is a socially just, culturally enriching place. That deserves cooperation. I have great respect for Senator Murray, but this provision that Senator Mackay wants to remove is one that really poisons the climate in which industrial relations should be properly carried out.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to follow up on a matter that was mentioned by Senator Murray in relation to this amendment moved by the opposition. Senator Murray indicated that he thought it was an extension of what the previous Labor government industrial relations legislation allowed. He mentioned that it used to be in awards. It is not in the 20 allowable matters, so there is no right of entry under awards, and there will be no right of entry under awards with what got pushed through under the workplace relations bill. So, no, it is not something in addition to what existed before; it is basically saying it is fair enough to say that somehow or other this right ought to exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time and time again we have heard the government come in and use membership levels of unions to bash workers over the head. For instance, they say, `Look, if there are fewer people joining unions, there is something wrong with the union movement.' The government are actually helping to create the situation where people do not have access 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to information about what their entitlements are, what unions there are and how easily they can join a union. They are actually creating that situation by not allowing union representatives into the workplace without a very difficult process. We have already heard that, in Western Australia at least, there are a lot of issues about workers' health and safety. That lack of access to information puts workers at risk. It puts their lives at risk. People have died in Western Australia because of the inability of unions to have guaranteed access to the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is not a situation where the opposition are asking for something over and above what was in the Labor government legislation. They are trying to provide that right for workers to have access to that information that they otherwise would not get. Remember, we just heard the opposition say, in relation to withdrawals from amalgamated organisations, that they believe workers have a right to information. Yes, they do. On issues to do with their workplace, one of the best ways to make sure they have access to their rights is if the unions are able to go into the workplace and tell them what they are.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to acknowledge the contributions by Senator Cooney and Senator Margetts because I think they are absolutely relevant. Perhaps I could put it in this way to the government and to the Democrats: if you join a union, surely you have the right for that union to provide a service to you. That is really what we are on about. To use an example that the government may be able to relate to, it is a bit like subscribing to a magazine and the government coming in and saying, `You can't have that magazine.' In fact, it is a type of market intervention, dare I say it, by the government in terms of the capacity of those workers who choose to belong to a union. Workers should be able to access that service and have a union representative come in when they wish&mdash;to put it in parlance that the government may be able to understand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important to say to Senator Murray that I endorse the comments made by Senator Cooney and Senator Margetts but, if 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7940"> somebody chooses to belong to a union, why shouldn't they have the right to have that union come and see them to provide the sort of service that they require? Senator Margetts, quite correctly, gave examples in terms of occupational health and safety. Under this government's provision, if a union member has difficulty with an occupational health and safety matter at work, unless the appropriate award coverage is there, that union would not be able to come in, see that union member, examine the site and determine whether or not there was an occupational health and safety difficulty there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, to use parlance that the government can relate to, we do not believe this government should be seeking to intervene in the union market. We believe there should be free access between a union and the people who wish to join that union. We encourage the Democrats to rethink their position.

Their arguments that they are just little weeny technical amendments in the bill itself do not necessarily hold water. I am prepared to support the opposition in relation to this issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the provision as it now stands, the reference to `relevant award' can only mean a relevant state award. The provision is about the criteria applied by state tribunals in relation to the approval of state agreements. For the approval of state agreements by state tribunals, the relevant award benchmark will necessarily be a state award. So, in summary, the government regards this as an important provision and believes that the opposition amendment will make a significantly negative impact on the scheme which the government supports. </PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">There are two amendments that honourable senators will see that deal with aspects of the issue dealt with in my amendment (1) on page 719. This revisits an area which was debated in the consideration of the 1996 industrial relations legislation, when I pointed out to the Senate that `industrial action', as written in the bill, may mean almost anything. At the time, initially, we were prepared to give the government the benefit of the doubt and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> believe that they did not mean that employers would be forced to dock the pay of workers for any possible sort of action, including work&hyphen;to&hyphen;rule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sometimes, if something is dangerous, employees try to indicate there is a problem. Sometimes something additional to employees' paid duties may be required to be undertaken&mdash;for instance, teachers may choose not to agree to take on excursions which are in effect in their own time. Ironically, those instances can be regarded as industrial action. And there are all sorts of other issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pretty soon the government found that they had a monstrous, unenforceable situation. Most of us have received letters saying, `If your staff ever attend meetings you must tell us so that we can dock their pay.' What a monstrous assertion! What a dreadful thing to happen in 1997!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time of that debate I pointed out this consequence to the Senate, and in particular I pointed it out to Senator Murray who represented the Australian Democrats, as he is here today in this debate. Like most people in the Senate, he did not realise that that was what the government had in mind. As I said, initially I gave the government the benefit of the doubt. I thought that maybe it was an unintended consequence, but, during the course of the debate, it became clear that it was an intended consequence on the part of the government&mdash;they meant any form of industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the debate it was explained that the reason for that very broad definition of industrial action being put into industrial relations legislation in the first place was not to try to beat workers over the head, that it was actually there to make sure that there could be early and relevant intervention so that issues could be taken to a tribunal before they became full&hyphen;scale industrial action. That was said  to be the reason for the broad definition. But the government took that broad definition and used it as a means of beating workers over the head, and I believe that was a very draconian step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government&mdash;as have we&mdash;have found this to be an unworkable situation. At one 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7943"> stage we know that the entire public sector was stopping for one or two minutes at a time to see how on earth the government could enforce this situation. I guess Senator Murray has tried to redeem himself with his amendment (10), but I do not believe it goes far enough. Basically, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purpose of this Part, industrial action does not include action by employees that is authorised, agreed to or accepted by the employer of the employees.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a good point inasmuch as it was noted in the debate that there could be a ridiculous situation where an employer could be quite happy with the industrial action that was being taken, or quite at ease with the industrial action that was being taken for various reasons, therefore they should not be forced to dock the pay of their workers for action with which they either agreed or did not object to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, according to basic human rights principles, if you start defining industrial action according to whether or not an employer likes it, you have a very silly situation. So, whilst I will certainly agree to support Senator Murray's amendment, I will also add those aspects which in effect are included in work&hyphen;to&hyphen;rule&mdash;that is to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an employee is not deemed to be engaged in industrial action where the employee is fully engaged during his or her ordinary hours of work in performing work directed by the employer, notwithstanding that the employee may refuse to perform some other aspect of work required by the employer.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This will cover minor work&hyphen;to&hyphen;rule disputes involving people such as nurses and teachers and people who believe they have a social responsibility to the people they serve. They are often people who work under very straitened conditions, who have had their pay and conditions kept down in many instances, but who want to make sure that their message is getting across without creating a problem for the people to whom they are dedicated. To start requiring that people's pay be docked in those kinds of situations I think is a very dangerous thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very unlikely that, say, the Western Australian education department will authorise a work&hyphen;to&hyphen;rule situation&mdash;in fact, it is ridicu

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Road transport is an issue which has major implications for greenhouse gas emissions. Roughly one&hyphen;third of our anthropogenic or person&hyphen;made CO2 emissions come from road transport. The approach to transport policy in this country will have major implications for our ability to effectively address the greenhouse problem, without imposing other unnecessary costs. The failure to have adequately addressed this issue in the last decade will already impose substantial costs. The NRTC has the job of road transport reform. It seeks to provide a coordinated national approach to road transport. It is the natural organisation to address the reform of road transport to take account of the environ 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7944"> mental implications of such transport. I would think the world would be looking to Australia to address some of these situations, as road transport is such a major issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fuel supply is also an important question in the context of road transport planning. We have an acknowledged decline in oil supplies&mdash;even acknowledged by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer). We are reaching the halfway point of known world oil supplies. We are already at the point where production exceeds the rate of discovery. We know that from here on in we are reaching the more expensive range of oil sources. That means that within the next 10 years the price of oil will increase exceedingly. Even for purely selfish economic reasons we should be planning to deal with these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will see an increase in the marginal cost of oil and need to start planning for the reality now. That marginal cost of producing the next barrel of oil is going to increase quite substantially.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill. Minister, what is the government's reaction to President Clinton's announcement of the United States greenhouse gas emission target? Does Australia support the United States announcement, and does Australia share the United States view of the role of the developing countries in the climate change negotiations?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The United States has added a further position to the negotiating table overnight. I think that is a helpful contribution to the debate in the lead&hyphen;up to Kyoto. What the United States has done is to suggest an appropriate target for the United States. It is interesting that what it has done is to select a target that reflects the particular national circumstances of the United States. In other words, it has nominated a figure that it believes can be achieved, consistent with what might be described as adopting sensible domestic practices providing a certain amount of incentive, providing a certain opportunity for domestic reform and providing a certain amount of encouragement for domestic industry in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is very much along the same lines as the Australian approach to this debate. Australia has always said that we as a country should make a reasonable contribution, one that can contribute to a better global outcome, but that it also should be consistent with our national circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that we now have from the majors three different positions on the table: the position of Europe, the position of Japan, and now that of the United States. They all substantially differ, but they all in some ways reflect what can be achieved by the economies that they represent. Australia's position, of course, will be different again, and we hope to be able to release that figure as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that, if we were to apply the United States' suggested figure to our country, the consequence would be very significant economic sacrifice and the loss of a large number of jobs. That is why that figure would not be a sensible figure for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7946"> Australia to accept. Obviously, this government has made it clear from the start that we want to be part of a good global outcome, we want Australia to accept its fair share of the burden, but we are not going to sacrifice Australian jobs to achieve that outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were a lot of things in the Clinton speech which were helpful to the debate and were certainly not inconsistent with the points that we have been making. The issues of the science, the importance of the issue, the need for a global response are all things that we have been saying. The need for flexibility in implementation is something that we agree with. The need to engage developing countries within the solution is obviously essential if you are going to achieve an effective global outcome. The language of President Clinton was that it required `meaningful participation by developing countries', which is very much in accordance with our own views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His preference for market solutions over regulatory solutions to maximise the potential outcome is along the lines of our position. He said that this was a challenge for the whole of the community and not just for governments. In fact, he adopted something, Senator Parer, very close to our own greenhouse challenge program in relation to domestic industry in the United States, and it is good to see that that is being taken up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">President Clinton called for reform of the electricity market in the United States; and we are well advanced on that in our own country. He called for more effective energy usage by the US government; and we are going down the same lines in that regard. Madam President, when you look at the speech as a whole, there is a lot in there that is very similar to the direction that we have taken, and I think it is a helpful contribution to what is a very complex but vitally important negotiation.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

If you do not know anything about it, which is much more likely, then you had better scurry out there and find out who is putting this forward without your knowledge.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Saying that it is only a majority does not mean anything anyway because that is what you said about the Commonwealth Bank. Remember, Ralph Willis even put out the prospectus saying that they would not go beyond selling off a majority interest in the Commonwealth Bank. Of course, once Labor was re&hyphen;elected in 1993 it did precisely the opposite. So do not believe for a moment, because we do not and the public does not, that a form of words like that will get you off the hook.</PARA>

Since then we have seen nation after nation decry Australia's bloody&hyphen;mindedness, and today you lost your last major card when President Bill Clinton made it clear that the US will not endorse your position and, in fact, wants binding targets. Firstly, will you reconsider now that we are an international pariah? Secondly, will you throw out the useless ABARE report and encourage the new jobs that are there waiting to be done? Finally, do you agree that we must quickly recognise the potential for renewable technologies and that international market opportunities will flow on if we develop a strong domestic market?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a strange question but I will have a go at answering it. In fact, I would suggest, Senator, that the principles that underlie our position are being more widely recognised and respected by our negotiating partners each day. On that basis, you will understand why I think your question is oddly out of order with the direction of these negotiations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that I made in answer to an earlier question was that President Clinton has put down a formula today that suits the national circumstances of the United States. It does not call for no action. In fact, he puts forward a number of domestic changes in terms of incentives and other ways that would encourage a better domestic greenhouse performance, but basically it fits their national circumstance. It is what he believes can be achieved by the United States without economic loss. That is basically the position that Australia is advocating. We have argued that Australia should make a worthwhile contribution but it should be one that does not undermine our economy, does not sacrifice Australian jobs and does not provide an extra burden to the regions of Australia that would suffer under a uniform proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I said earlier was that, in fact, we now have a number of different formulas and targets on the table. Japan put down its a couple of weeks ago. It talked about 1990 levels less five per cent plus an allowance for various elements of differentiation. One of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7950"> those areas of differentiation was within our formula. It added another two that suited its national circumstances. It called for some pain for Japan. For example, it called, in their interpretation, for them to build another 20 nuclear power stations, which might be something that Senator Lees is suggesting for Australia as an alternative. I do not know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Europeans have done likewise. They have allowed differentiation within the European community. They have allowed Portugal to go 40 per cent above 1990 levels. As I recall, they allowed Spain to go 30 per cent above 1990 levels. Out of that differentiated model, they have an overall picture that they believe they can deliver as a community, a community target that will not cost them unduly in terms of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All Australia wants is to be put in the same boat. By the time you give differentiation for the European states, differentiation for the east European states and differentiation for the developing world, as was acknowledged by President Clinton today, so I presume you endorse that, there are only eight countries left in the world that you are not giving the right to differentiate. Why should we be one of those eight countries and sacrifice thousands of jobs just to please the Europeans? Why should we do that? This government is not going to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, this government is prepared to take tough domestic decisions, and the Prime Minister will be making further announcements in due course. This government is prepared to further encourage industry, as we have been doing through the greenhouse challenge program. I commend industry that has come on board and done a good job in that regard. This government is prepared to ensure Australia does its fair share and does its bit to achieve a better global outcome, but we are not going to take an unfair burden and we are not going to throw Australian jobs on the trash heap.</PARA></ANSWER>

Minister, do you agree that, as far as differentiation is concerned, if we keep pushing this line we could end up having to do more than the rest of the world because of our current position, and that we have the flexibility within Australia to differentiate between industries, depending on where they are now at? Did you note that most of Europe, specifically the English <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guardian</EMPHASIS>  today, believes that we are totally out of step and that `Oz is up a gum tree and out on a limb'?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we have said on binding targets is that, until we know the obligation that is going to be sought of us, it would be inappropriate, foolish and bad public policy for us to agree to sign on. In other words, what you are suggesting we should do is sign a blank cheque on Australian jobs, and we are not going to do that. We believe we have a responsibility to contribute to a better global greenhouse outcome, but we have also got a responsibility to grow the Australian economy and provide jobs. We want to achieve both, and we believe you can achieve both.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lees is just starting to understand differentiation. An industry, for example, that has already made the sacrifice and spent the money to put in new energy efficiency plant may be able to do less than one that has not done it. But that is what differentiation is all about. It is about putting enough pressure on each industry and each state to contribute what they can consistent with preserving jobs and economic opportunity.

I would dismiss that, Senator Margetts. Obviously, I can neither deny nor confirm other aspects of that article.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I can say to you is that there are opportunities for us across all sectors to do better in relation to greenhouse gas emissions. We think that it is reasonable that best international standard is expected of Australia. If we look at the domestic sector, for example, there is the potential for better insulation standards and the like that would help make a positive contribution. If we look at the transport sector, there is the potential for better emission standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should mention to Senator Lees that the second area of domestic reform that Japan is looking at after building 20 new nuclear power stations is even more stringent emission requirements for motor vehicles. There is that potential for Australia. Similarly, in relation to the fixed production of energy, industry use of energy and, dare I say it, land use policy there is the opportunity in this country for better performance and therefore a greater contribution to reducing global greenhouse gases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is working its way through all of those sectors. We will be putting to the people a program that calls for a stronger domestic response than that which we now have. It is interesting that, under the current domestic response, our performance has been better than that of many of the countries that criticise us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our increase, as Senator Margetts will know, from 1990 to 1995 was about six per cent. That was a considerably better result than many other countries within annex 1. It demonstrates that the voluntary no regrets

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Justice.

Will you inform the Senate of the government's initiatives to prevent violence in our community, including the Australian Violence Prevention Awards?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Macdonald for the question. He rightly identifies that fear of violence in the community, especially in the rural community and amongst the elderly, is a problem. Today I had the opportunity to announce the four national winners in the Australian Violence Prevention Awards. These are jointly sponsored by the heads of Australian governments; that is, Commonwealth, state and territory. It is a combined initiative and includes a total prize pool of some $100,000. The whole system is designed to reward the most outstanding projects for the prevention or the reduction of violence. Projects can focus on specific groups, such as women or children or youth or the family, or they may take the other tack and focus on specific problems, such as excessive alcohol consumption, violence in the media or violence in sport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent figures on the cost of crime suggest that for every man, woman and child in Australia, the cost of crime is some $100,000 a year, and that gives us a $20 billion a year cost across Australia. It is clear, therefore, that in tackling the causes of violence in crime we cannot rely on the justice system alone, which picks up the crime after it has been committed. We absolutely have to give a much greater focus to crime prevention strategies which will reduce the opportunities and the motivation for criminal activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister recently announced some $13 million in a national campaign against violence in crime, which will support a very wide range of crime prevention initiatives. The awards play a very important role in the fight against violent crime. This year 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there were over 100 entries from across Australia. The projects have to have been up and running for a year. They are assessed on a range of criteria, including whether the project can be copied elsewhere, whether it will be useful to other communities to follow the example, whether it actually does reduce or prevent violence, and the degree to which it is innovative and raises community awareness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The winners of the violence prevention awards this year cover a range of interesting aspects. The lead winner of the $20,000 prize is the positive parenting program, or the triple P program, from Queensland. In this program, parents are taught strategies for building positive relationships with their children and to develop appropriate discipline strategies. There has been significant publicity given to this program&mdash;most recently by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> program. It is a most effective program and one that can be transmitted around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three other programs received awards of $10,000 each. In Queensland, the family care program received $10,000. That program involves a trial of home based nursing services which are provided to families that are identified as being vulnerable&mdash;that is, instead of waiting until a problem occurs, vulnerable families are identified and assistance is provided so that the problem does not occur. Preventing workplace violence in Victoria, a scheme initiated by Jobwatch, helps employees who experience violence at work, giving them a capacity for reporting and redress. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Opposition senators interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am informed that the government of Western Australia is close to completing assessments and approvals for the proposed Oakajee deepwater port and associated industrial estate near Geraldton.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), to questions without notice asked today, relating to nursing home bonds.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yesterday and today the minister has given the worst performance I can remember in my 10 years in the Senate in the gibberish he has used to try to explain the government's policy regarding the bonds being charged for nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to compliment Senator Herron on two things he did in my 10 years here that ought to be noted. Firstly, he has always opposed the tobacco industry and has moved to restrict smoking in Australia, when it is against his party's policy. Secondly, he very courageously took leave from this Senate to work in Rwanda as a doctor, when that tragedy occurred some years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then, his performance as a minister has been abysmal. In his answers today and yesterday on the issue of nursing homes, to defend himself he has referred to senators as altar boys and acolytes; he has accused Senator Mackay of being a better blonde than Senator Kernot; he has attacked trade unionists as being lazy, even though he is a member of the strongest trade union in Australia, the AMA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today the minister had to withdraw remarks about the Irish. He also attacked Senator Crowley, implying that she is no longer a doctor, just because she is a senator. He also defended himself with phrases about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Marie Celeste</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS>. I think it very appropriate that he made the Freudian slip of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mentioning the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS> as it reflects his own performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again today, when Senator Faulkner and I asked questions about conflict of interest, his response ultimately was, `The common law covers it.' That is utter gibberish. We did not ask about the common law; we asked, `Does the government have a policy about the conflict of interest between the Moran group running a several hundred million dollar nursing home empire and also apparently having a number of real estate agencies operating in the same building?' It was a simple question. His answer was, `The common law covers that.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How does the common law cover the conflict of interest? He could have said, `There is no conflict of interest', or `There is a conflict of interest', or `I will investigate; I will come back.' The reasonable thing for the minister to do if he was not sure was to take it on notice. This minister gets up and babbles away and says the first thing that comes into his mind. In this case, common law was the defence.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Collins quite rightly said, this is gibberish. He seemed to have the view, this hopeless minister, this hapless minister, that the best way to defend the government's policy was to fill up the four minutes allocated to answer the question, even when it was contradictory, even when it could not be understood by any sensible person. The one time he did say yes or no was in answer to a question by my colleague Senator Collins who will deal with how the minister got himself into even deeper problems by attempting to give a brief answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, on the remaining matters, this minister could not explain the government's policy. I asked him about the connections with Mr Moran and the Moran group.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that Senator Schacht's little speech exemplifies the approach the Labor Party has taken to this whole issue. It completely ignores the real issue, the state of Australia's nursing homes. We have heard nothing about the real issue, the appalling state of Australia's nursing homes, or the fact that the policy of the government is designed to improve conditions in those nursing homes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know it has already been said to the Senate at least four times in taking note of answers over the last couple of months, but the fact is that nursing homes around Australia on the whole are of very poor quality. For example, 40 per cent of nursing home residents share their bedrooms with four or more people; 13 per cent of nursing homes do not meet fire regulations, and another 11 per cent do not meet health regulations. These are pretty appalling statistics. There has been a real need to improve the standard of nursing homes, and that is what the government has set out do to with this policy to introduce a bond system. The idea of the bond system is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that money will become available for capital improvements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to remember that Australia faces an ever&hyphen;increasing proportion of its population falling into the aged group. In fact, something like a 48 per cent increase will occur in the number of people aged over 65 in the next 20 years. We have to do something to prepare to meet their needs. That is why the government has introduced this very sensible policy to enable nursing homes to have access to capital to improve facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know it has been said many times before, but this policy which the government is introducing is just an extension of a policy and a program to charge accommodation bonds for hostels which the Labor government introduced in 1988. That policy worked very well. In fact, people in hostels today have benefited greatly from that policy because the standards of the facilities in which they are living have greatly improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very curious that the opposition is so critical of this policy when in fact it is really, I suppose, a credit to them that the government has been so impressed with the success of the policy they introduced that they have extended it to nursing homes. Very largely, what has been said has been scaremongering; they have been trying to frighten people about accommodation bonds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that the accommodation bond system in hostels has meant that people have had to pay a fairly modest bond of around $26,000. There is no reason at all to believe that accommodation bonds in nursing homes will be any different. They will not be anything like the horrendous amounts which the opposition is claiming they will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a member of the Senate Community Affairs Reference Committee inquiry which looked into the question of nursing homes. One of the witness was a Dr Norman Marinovic, who is the head of the geriatric service at Fremantle Hospital. He said in evidence to the committee that he did not see any problem with accommodation bonds for nursing homes and that he believed the system would work just as well as it had in the case of hostels. In other words, he be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7961"> lieved that the standard of nursing homes would be improved under the government's policy, just as the standard of hostels has improved under the government's policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, I would like to quote an endorsement which came from Maureen Lister of Aged Care Australia, which represents the church and charity community group sector and provides most of the hostels and about 45 per cent of all nursing homes in Australia. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Today</EMPHASIS> on ABC Radio on 11 February Ms Lister said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to take note of the responses by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) during question time today on the nursing homes issue because I am sick and tired of the minister's non&hyphen;stop response to every concern raised with him in this chamber that it is some sort of Labor plot. If honourable senators would take the trouble to look back over the minister's responses in question time through the whole of this week, they will see that this has been the constant theme running through every response from Minister Herron to questions on the nursing home issue. It is a pattern that he has developed in his area of prime responsibility&mdash;Aboriginal affairs&mdash;to hide the fact that he is simply not on top of the detail of his responsibilities, no matter what portfolio they reside in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this issue, he would have us all believe that there is no concern in the community about this government's policy on nursing homes. According to the minister, those on this side of the chamber are indulging in `a scare campaign designed to terrify older people and their relatives'. So there we have it. Everyone can rest easy. There is no actual problem, there is no concern; it is simply a Labor Party plot to scare the most vulnerable in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party's concerns in the Northern Territory over this matter are publicly shared now, not by many in the community in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Northern Territory and the Northern Territory Council on the Ageing but, as reported today, by the conservative political colleagues of the minister in the Northern Territory government led by Shane Stone QC MP&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">`queer customer' that stands for, with deference to Rumpole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw your attention to a report in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory News</EMPHASIS> headlined `Elderly Fear Cost of Nursing Homes'. The report contains a number of statements made by speakers at a Royal College of Nursing seminar in Darwin yesterday on discrimination against elderly people. A keynote speaker was the Northern Territory's conservative Minister for Health, Denis Burke. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory News</EMPHASIS>, he used the occasion to launch `a stinging attack on the Howard government's reforms to nursing home policy'. He said that most Territorians in aged care could not afford the accommodation bonds proposed by this government. Mr Burke said that about 90 per cent of aged Territorians in residential care were financially disadvantaged. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no limits. The individuals who are financially disadvantaged will have limited access in the future. Those who have assets will have to compete with others in some sort of lottery, which I think is to their detriment at the time of their life when they are most vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is not the Labor Party talking, Senator Eggleston, in respect of the fact that you also talk about scaremongering. This is your conservative colleague the Northern Territory Minister for Health. In the same address, Mr Burke went on to say that the federal government was hell&hyphen;bent on driving itself over a political cliff. He warned that, if the federal government did not rethink its position, it would face, `a massive fight from state and territory governments'. Where does this leave the erstwhile minister and his claims of a Labor Party scare campaign? In my view, it leaves him exactly where I expected him to be when he started out this week retailing these stupid conspiracy theories. That leaves him with egg all over his face&mdash;a very familiar position for this minister to be in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His political stupidity is not confined to Labor Party conspiracy theories. While his 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7962"> ministerial colleagues, Ministers Wooldridge and Smith, were back&hyphen;pedalling at a million miles an hour to distance themselves from the outrageous statements by the self&hyphen;proclaimed architect of this policy, Mr Moran, we had the relevant minister in this place, Minister Herron, yesterday clutching Mr Moran to his philosophical bosom saying that he is an Australian hero and that we should all admire and respect him because he is a self&hyphen;made man.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know what other good aspects Mr Moran may or may not have, but anyone who claims with a broad brush that the elderly people of Australia who object to selling their homes to pay him a bond to enter one of his nursing homes are `bludgers, silvertails and hoarders' is, in my view, beneath contempt.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak on this particular issue to bring some balance to the debate. I accept there is fear out in the community but that fear has been generated by the campaign run from the other side, particularly in the House of Representatives. There is so much misrepresentation around in terms of what is occurring that it really is quite a sad day for Australia, I believe, that we should see this happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to place on record a couple of points. In a lot of ways, the need to deal with the issue of aged people and the necessity for nursing homes and what they require in their later years is not dissimilar, in a sense, to what we were confronted with when we had to deal with the $10 billion deficit when we came into government. It was the Labor government which left nursing homes in such a mess. We should never forget that when dealing with this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard many quotes but one worth commenting on is that of Maureen Lister of Aged Care Australia, who said, `We'll be able to see quite significant improvements in the building of nursing homes, and everyone knows that is gravely needed.' As I understand it, she is involved with 45 per cent of nursing homes in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will endeavour to put to bed a few of the furphies that we have heard. With regard to better access for concessional residents, we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have just heard Senator Bob Collins's comments with regard to the financially disadvantaged. I want to put on the record the fact that financial disadvantage will not affect a person's ability to get the care they need. That is a very important point. Every facility will be required to set aside a minimum number of places for those who cannot pay an accommodation bond. In the hostel sector now, the average national target for places for financially disadvantaged persons is 23 per cent. The concessional resident target under the new scheme will be 27 per cent of places nationally&mdash;in each region, according to local need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will ensure that all older people, whether concessional residents or not, have an equal chance of getting a place. I want to emphasise that point: they will have an equal chance of getting a place. It is a very important point in the context of this debate and the necessity to get the facts on the table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, concessional residents will not wait any longer to get a place. There will be equal access. Experience with hostels shows that people who are financially disadvantaged wait no longer for a place. Let us remember that the hostel policy is almost identical to the policy adopted by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Providers will receive an extra subsidy of $7 a day for each concessional resident and $12 if their number of concessional residents totals more than 40 per cent. This is a big improvement on Labor's $3.50 a day extra for financially disadvantaged residents. In fact, according to my sums, it is double. We are confident that, with higher government subsidies and better protections, the new arrangements will provide greater assurance that older people will have access to the care they need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to deal with one other aspect in the time remaining to me&mdash;that is, the sale of a resident's home. Under these arrangements, residents do not have to sell their home to pay for a bond. From everything we heard during the campaign that was run a week or 10 days ago, we would have believed that that was the case. Let me assure everybody that it is a concern that is shared not only by elderly people but by people who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7963"> accept responsibility for their mothers, fathers or members of their families&mdash;in some instances it could be their aunts and uncles or their friends. People need to understand that they do not have to sell their home to pay for a bond. They may prefer to pay from other assets or income, from borrowing against the home or other assets, or from rental income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the big furphies is this scaremongering campaign&mdash;I cannot describe it as anything else&mdash;that aged people will have to sell their home. You can understand why they would get upset about that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

Indeed, that is the case. I am pleased it now appears that that fear is getting through to members on the government side, at least in the Senate. I am aware that a couple of members of the government parties in the other place have also listened to community concerns and fears, and have courageously expressed those fears in their respective party forums.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope more of them do it. I hope more of them will encourage the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) to echo the words Senator Crane has just used&mdash;that individuals will not have to sell their homes to get into a nursing home. Let the minister say that to individual elderly Australians who do not have any asset other than their family home and who want to get into a nursing home. Let the minister assure those individuals that they will not have to sell their homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the minister will not do that because the government's proposed changes in this area mean that individuals will have to do that. I dearly hope that other members of the government parties&mdash;perhaps Senator McGauran, who will follow me in this debate&mdash;will echo those words. I hope that Senator McGauran has listened to his constituency in Victoria and will, in turn, express their fears in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are doing this afternoon is taking note of the answers during question time today of the Minister representing the Minis

As Senator Bob Collins said in his contribution, with regard to practically every question that was asked of the minister, he came back with the retort that it was a Labor plot.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or perhaps, Senator McKiernan, you do want to hear the government's policy. He really does want to hear it. He is genuine after all. Senator McKiernan, there are three reasons that we have introduced this policy. Firstly, because of the estimated sheer growth in the number of older Australians in the next 20 years; secondly, because of how run down nursing homes have become over the past decade; and, thirdly, because of how ill&hyphen;prepared we are for the estimated future growth in the number of older Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the future growth in the numbers entering nursing homes, it is no exaggeration to say that one of the great tasks facing the coalition when it achieved government was to plan for this future wave. The statistics are compelling. The number of aged Australians over 65 will grow to some 48 per cent over the next 20 years. To put that in number terms, in 1991 the number of Australians over the age of 65 was two million. Within the next 20 or so years there will be as many as five million. This government, because of these compelling statistics, is planning for the future. In fact, this planning should have been done some 10 years ago.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Closely linked to this is the state of the nursing homes. The previous government was warned as far back as 1993, in the Gregory report, that the nursing home industry needed a capital injection of some $130 million per year over at least the next decade. This government found that nursing homes across Australia needed capital upgrading. They did not meet the fire regulations or the health regulations. There were narrow corridors, there was dingy lighting and there were unhygienic kitchens. More than 40 per cent of nursing home residents were forced to share a bedroom with four or more people. That is the foundation stone on which we have built our policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short time I have left, I would like to allay the concerns of my Victorian residents&mdash;as Senator McKiernan invited me to do&mdash;in regard to the safety net. Those who cannot financially meet the bond will be catered for and will have direct access to nursing homes. If people do not meet the financial criteria, if people are under the threshold, we will put aside 27 per cent for nursing homes for what are called `concessional rates'. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I begin by looking at the answer given to a question of mine by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Senator Ellison, earlier this week. Unfortunately, he is not able to be with us for this debate today, but in his answer he fell immediately into the inevitable government rhetoric that the answer to the jobs crisis lies, first and foremost, in the work for the dole scheme and, failing that, in economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am certain that Senator Ellison has been very carefully and eagerly studying the obligatory rhetoric on jobs since assuming his present role, he obviously has a lot of work to do, because none of his colleagues&mdash;not one minister, not even Dr Kemp&mdash;has at any stage dared to go so far as to suggest that the work for the dole scheme will have any impact whatsoever on unemployment levels.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact the minister's own department has stressed over and over, in the context of the merits of the work for the dole bill, that job outcomes and training do not even factor in the formal objectives of this scheme. As we have seen, it has never been enough to simply refer to economic growth as a solution. It was not good enough under the previous governments, and it certainly is not good enough now. It does not automatically bring down unemployment levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite years of economic growth, growth which was supposed to generate jobs, hundreds of thousands of Australians remain unemployed and many others who want full-time work are stuck in part-time and casual positions barely able to make ends meet. At the same time as working conditions are declining stress levels are increasing. Those in full-time work are being expected, as we have seen from the latest statistics, to work longer and longer hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this pattern continues the result will be a divided and unequal society, a society where a privileged minority have access to well&hyphen;paid and very satisfying work with probably some promotional opportunities, but the vast majority of Australian workers will be left to fight for fewer and fewer jobs&mdash;jobs which will be of poor quality, jobs which will have little, if any, security and satisfaction, jobs which will be highly stressed, jobs which will have no prospects for advancement, few fringe benefits and low wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So who is responsible for this pattern? Senator Ellison  would have us believe that this government is nothing like the former government but, frankly, in my view, looking at the evidence they are as bad as each other. Australians have endured more than a decade of both federal and state governments seeing themselves solely as economic managers, pulling out of providing services, selling off public assets and consistently refusing to place social and environmental goals on at least an equal footing with economic ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the economic bottom line becomes the only criterion governments really care about, other important national objectives tend to go out the window. But what about the important national and economic objective of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7968"> ensuring business and consumer confidence by concentrating on securing Australian jobs? How can you justify attempts to explain away the loss of 3.3 million full&hyphen;time jobs to redundancies over the past 12 years? How do you even begin to explain the loss on average, year in and year out since 1986, of 275,000 full-time jobs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that neither the Labor Party nor the Howard&hyphen;led coalition have any policies in place to reverse this loss of full-time positions. Let us just go through this government's list. These are jobs directly lost thanks to the actions of this government. This government is responsible for the shedding of 180,000 jobs since March 1996&mdash;27,000 are directly from the Public Service due to the government's cuts; 22,000 are from Telstra as part of the preparations for privatisation; 20,000 are from state and local governments as a result of grant cuts to those bodies; 25,000 are from public works due to a $1 billion cut in spending; 39,000 are from the manufacturing sector due largely to a collapse in confidence; and 46,000 are due to a cut in labour market program places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is little doubt that if the rampant job shedding encouraged under the policy settings of both the Labor Party and the coalition had been reduced by just one&hyphen;quarter many of today's unemployed would probably have jobs right now. The simple fact is that Labor and the coalition have not only failed to create new jobs&mdash;and I particularly emphasise new jobs for young Australians&mdash;but also failed to protect existing jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have certainly been some distractions in the last couple of weeks. But the Democrats refuse to allow the furore over travel rorts and the actions of former Senator Kernot to distract us from the main game. There needs to be a new approach, some creative solutions, to the jobs dilemma in this country, and we should be investigating those right now. My colleague Senator Stott Despoja, the Democrats employment spokesperson, will rise in a few minutes to introduce to the Senate the Australian Democrats most recent initiatives on jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been getting down to the job on jobs&mdash;consulting the Australian public on the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> question of how they think unemployment should be addressed. In March of this year we commenced a public consultation project in search of viable solutions to the jobs crisis. We approached forward looking and creative business and community leaders and academics to contribute to a discussion on the Internet on jobs. We asked them to put up a challenge to the existing paradigms and we are pleased and, in some instances, quite surprised at the results. We have shown, and Senator Stott Despoja will demonstrate, that there are a range of alternatives to the economic rationalist approach so readily embraced by the two mainstream parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This book is a testament to Australians in all walks of life who care deeply about the employment crisis&mdash;those who we approached for essays, those in the general public who public contributed via the Internet and the Australian Democrats staff and members who have contributed endless ideas and innovations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion before us is both pejorative and unbecoming. Even if one trawls over the Labor Party's poor performance in this area I do not think you could argue that it was on the basis of absolute contempt for the unemployed. I have to say that with the unemployment problem facing the Howard government there is nobody I know on the Liberal side or indeed the Labor side of politics who says, `Ha, ha! There are 800,000 people unemployed.' We genuinely try to seek solutions and the argument between the two 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7969"> sides of this place and the nation is about how you overcome the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that we have arguments as to how to overcome the problem indicates that we acknowledge it is a problem, Senator Lees, and we are trying to do something about it. But to suggest that they are treated with absolute contempt is unbecoming, Senator Lees, and I have to say to you that it does nothing for your prospects for leadership of the Australian Democrats and your standing and your party's standing within the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sure, let us have a fight, a debate and an argument about our policy thrusts and directions where you think ours may be wrong and yours may be right. But I would never descend to the suggestion that the Democrats treat the unemployed with absolute contempt, although I might be forgiven for saying so when one reads today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> where we are told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hairdresser Vicki McFarlane was ready to take on two new staff members at her Parramatta Salon in time for Christmas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But when opposition MPs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">including the Democrats&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"We feel betrayed by what the Senate has done," she said yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Do you know what? There are two people in Parramatta that also feel betrayed. Because of the policies of the Democrats and the Labor Party, there are going to be two people in Parramatta that face Christmas 1997 without a job&mdash;a direct result of the way the Democrats and the Labor Party cast their vote in this place only a few days ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion that has been put before us suggests that there are 800,000 unemployed persons in Australia. Unfortunately, that is correct, and the government is dealing with that issue. If time permits, I will go through some of our initiatives in that regard. But we are then told `and for the loss of 3.3 million jobs over the last decade'. If there were 3.3 million jobs actually lost out of the economy, wouldn't it stand to reason that you might have an unemployment rate of 3.3 million? 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> What has happened is that a lot of people have lost their jobs but they do not tell you the other side of the equation, that a lot of those people that have lost their jobs have in fact gained new jobs, and that is where this motion is so very deceptive and very misleading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One wonders: have Senator Lees and the Democrats given some thought to these figures? Where would they have trawled these figures up from? It is quite obvious. They are from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> headline. A cheap journalistic headline becomes the substance of the Australian Democrats policy on unemployment. That is how devoid they are of policy consideration. That is how devoid they are of actually thinking about the issues that are confronting this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion goes on to tell us that the Howard government and others have failed `to fully explore creative but practical solutions to the unemployment crisis currently gripping this nation.' I would have thought that if the Australian Democrats were fair dinkum they would have said `explore creative but practical solutions to the unemployment crisis such as&mdash;' and then given us definite examples. There is not a single example in the motion. Why? Because they do not have any solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What makes me so wild in this debate is that there are people who seek to portray themselves as the champions of the oppressed who come in here accusing this government of having absolute contempt for the unemployed, but you yourselves cannot come up with one single policy statement on the issue, other than if we go surfing on the net. What do we find about the Australian Democrats issues sheet on unemployment? It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Redefining Work</EMPHASIS> . With dramatic changes in our society and our economy, a goal of every Australian having work is an impossibility.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the Democrat policy. If you believe that every Australian cannot have a job, you tell us, Senator Lees, what is the acceptable rate of unemployment for this nation? I tell the Senate that the only acceptable rate for unemployment is zero, and that is what we are working towards.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7970">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We may not achieve that goal, and I accept that, but we will work day and night to get the unemployment level right down. We will not accept that soft cop&hyphen;out of saying, `It's impossible to give every Australian a job, so let's forget about it. Let's just condemn Labor and Liberal but not come up with any policy solutions.' If you had definite policy solutions, you would have got up in your introductory speech, Senator Lees, and told the Senate what the acceptable rate of unemployment was, how your policies would in fact reduce the numbers and what the numbers would be at the end of the implementation of your policies. But we know what your policy is.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy President, if I become somewhat passionate about this issue, I am sure that at least the unemployed in this country will forgive me, even if you don't. We were told by the former leader of the Australian Democrats in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  on Thursday, 10 October 1996 that the Democrats are developing a niche role as the nation's intellectual opposition whose solution for unemployment is that you cannot have a job for everybody in Australia, so why bother.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the Australian Democrats, we are trying and we do have some very good policies in place. One of the important strategies, of course, is deficit reduction, and we have handled that very well and very successfully. You know it. You are embarrassed about it, but the Australian people are thanking us for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is working to create real jobs, and this strategy has already contributed to strong economic growth in Australia. An aggressive deficit reduction program has significantly contributed to the lowest interest rate and inflation rate environment seen in Australia for many years. Indeed, I think it was only yesterday that other figures came out which were excellent in that regard. We are getting the policies in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new workplace relations framework has given employers greater operational flexibility and is improving productivity in the workplace. This will encourage employers to recruit as the economy grows. We are expanding vocational education and training programs in schools. This will provide senior secondary students with structured on&hyphen; and off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training which is recognised by industry. But, when we work in concert with McDonald's, you belittle our activities and you belittle the activities of McDonald's.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further assistance to enter the work force is available through the jobs pathway program with the assistance of employment brokers. New apprenticeships will provide expanded training opportunities, including for those disadvantaged in their access to vocational education and training. The government is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7971"> spending $550 million over the next two years to support more than 220,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The list goes on of the initiatives that we as a government have taken over the past 18 months. We reject the Democrat proposition that we cannot get a job for every Australian. We are determined to achieve that task. We will work tirelessly to achieve it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a stunning indictment of the attitude of the Labor Party&mdash;a stunning indictment which saw the people opposite thrown off the treasury bench at the last election. Why, I ask honourable senators, were the Labor Party thrown out of office at the last election? Because they were arrogant. Why at the last election did the people of Australia throw the Labor Party out of government? Because the Labor Party refused to accept the fact that they were responsible for the economic malaise in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party refused to accept the fact that they were responsible for unemployment. The Labor Party refused to accept the fact that they were responsible for high interest rates. The Labor Party refused to accept the fact that they were responsible for record bankruptcies. Now what do we see? We see an urgency motion brought by the Democrats, and the Labor Party seeks to continue their old ways. This is not the new Labor Party. This is not even the reconstructed Labor Party. This is the old, unreconstructable Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No matter whom they get to defect to them, they are still the same old `head in the sand, we're not responsible for the economic malaise in this country, even though we were in government for 13 years' Labor Party. That is why the Australian people, with a stunning blow, threw the Labor Party off the treasury benches at the last election. This debate today is proof to the Australian electorate that the Labor Party do not wish to be a responsible political party in this country. They are a party of political opportunists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the Democrats do not wish to have this motion amended. I think I have made the point for the government. Senator Lees may wish to speak to the suspension of standing orders, but it will be very clear that the government will be voting against the suspension of standing orders. We are here. We are happy to debate this motion that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7972"> Senator Lees has brought on. This government has some very positive things it wants to do. This government has very positive plans.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can have a sensible debate here about what is the best way to reduce unemployment, and I think that is what Senator Lees wants to do, but we will not allow the ALP to run away.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak briefly to the motion that has been moved by Senator Mackay. Senator Mackay wants to amend the motion that is before the chamber. The two speakers we have heard thus far in the debate on the urgency motion are the proponents of the motion&mdash;the Democrats&mdash;and the government. Senator Mackay, in my view rightly, believes that the motion is deficient and ought to be changed to reflect the reality of the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are to be congratulated for bringing on a debate in this chamber about 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unemployment. There is no doubt that it is the most important question in Australia today. I am somewhat surprised that in raising the issue of unemployment&mdash;the most important debate we could have&mdash;they are intolerant of any proposed change to the motion. They then put that proposed change as a question to this chamber to ascertain the support for the change but simply want to cleave to their own motion. If we are going to have a serious debate about unemployment then all points of view should be heard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All Senator Mackay wants to do is put a point of view which varies a little from the view which the Democrats wish to put. It would be reasonable for that motion to be accepted and for the chamber to have the opportunity to hear the argument on it and then vote accordingly. Anything less than allowing that procedure to unfold would be to inhibit the ability to properly discuss this issue. If we truly believe that unemployment is the most serious question&mdash;and I do and my party does&mdash;and if other people in this chamber believe this to be the case then they will be prepared to listen to points of view other than their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had the pyrotechnics of the schoolboy debating champion from the other side and it is a desperation call if ever I have heard one. All Senator O'Chee has to do is look at the polls to understand why people have drifted away from the government&mdash;and its response to unemployment&mdash;and are in increasing numbers favouring Labor and our attitude to managing what is a serious and concerning problem for this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to engage in the same histrionics as Senator O'Chee. The fire, brimstone and bluster which he employed were necessary to cover his embarrassment. You are embarrassed, Senator O'Chee, because you know that people do not believe you and in the most recent polling have been prepared to indicate that by indicating support for the Australian Labor Party or the minor parties in this chamber. So bluster away but do not think that there is anything credible in what you have to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude before my time is up in order to enable this debate to roll on, as I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7973"> think that it is a serious debate. I implore the government and the minor parties here to allow what ordinary Australians would regard as a fundamental democratic opportunity&mdash;that is, allow Senator Mackay to put an amendment which is at variance to the principal motion so that this chamber can vote on it. Let us do that and get on with the substance of this debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief because I do want to get on with the substance of this debate. I take issue with Senator Cook's idea that to have a serious debate we need to effectively gut the motion. The motion is written as it is because we are concerned about the 3.3 million jobs that have been lost over the last 10 years. We cannot just look in isolation at the last 18 months. We are looking at the bigger picture, the longer term reasons for the steady loss of jobs in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it most interesting that this side of the chamber seem to believe that to have a real debate they have to be left out of it&mdash;that we should only debate the current government's policies. I suggest to Senator Cook that, if it is his wish to just look at the policies of this government, we move another motion next week dealing with just that. This motion is written as it is because we believe we have to go back in time and look right through the growth of this idea that the economic rationalist ideal will somehow solve the jobs and unemployment problem. Obviously, I will be voting against this motion. If that is unsuccessful, we will not be supporting any changes to the motion that we have already moved.</PARA></SPEECH>

In relation to Senator Cook's contribution, I indicate that I have not heard such platitudinous self&hyphen;serving rubbish in this place for a long time.

Unemployment under Labor did not fall below nine per cent from March 1991 to November 1994&mdash;for nearly three years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the suspension of standing orders. I think it ought to be explained to the Senate what actually is going on here, because I would have thought senators may be somewhat confused.

This government is about trying to divert attention away from the abysmal performance that it is responsible for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since this government has come to office we have seen unemployment getting worse in this country. It is getting worse because this government's own policies have directly led to the smashing of demand and confidence in this economy and to undermining the security and the safeguard of the social wellbeing of this country as a result of its ideological obsessions with what is essentially an industrial relations reform agenda. That agenda is about destroying organised labour and it is about destroying the wages and conditions of working people in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has a deliberate policy of keeping unemployment high. It is a device to beat the unions around the head so it can pursue its fight inflation first strategies, its strategies of downsizing and reducing services

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he is. Senator George Campbell is a fine acquisition to the Labor Party on this side of the parliament and has a very deep knowledge of industry policy as a practitioner from the coalface. He is someone who worked with Australia's major corporations trying to develop a bipartisan approach to industry policy and job creation in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing that should be defined when confronting this issue is the role of government. The role of government is to give long, strong and dependable signals to the private sector in Australia as to what the framework for economic growth for this country is. In other words, the government has to have a vision. It has to know where it is going. It has to be able to then put in place a series of steps that are credible and that command community support in order to get to its destination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the single, strongest criticism that comes from the private sector in Australia about this government? The single, strongest criticism that comes from the private sector is that the government lacks vision. It makes 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7979"> day-to-day, short-term decisions. It does not have an overview of the direction of the development of the Australian economy, and some of its decisions are contradictory. In other words, the private sector of Australia&mdash;the sector that the government acknowledges in many of its press releases is the engine of economic growth for this country&mdash;is confused, does not understand what is happening and is at odds often with the government about the direction of economic growth for this country and what it believes and depends on as being the directions the government should take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is that so important? If industry lacks the confidence to make investments because it is uncertain of the climate into which they have been plunged by the government, they will act cautiously and not make those investments. Jobs that could be created will not be created. Opportunities that could be taken will be taken on cautiously and not to their full potential. That means, in short, that many more Australians will be out of work and many more opportunities for Australian industry to grow will be stunted and will not be able to develop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is there this confusion? Let us go back to the 1996-97 budget. Whatever is said about that budget and the rationale for it, let us look at the immediate effect of it. The government made across-the-board cuts to government expenditure in that budget. It did not differentiate between the types of cuts it made. Therefore, it cut government expenditure that aided and fuelled economic growth, as well as government expenditure on the outlay side that did not directly contribute to economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, the government cut out or reduced the amount of funding that went to industry in order for it to grow. It took a narrow, accountant's view of the budget&mdash;that is, cut outlays and get a balance on your bottom line. It did not take a creative view of the budget. It did not say, `What expenditure returns growth to the economy, takes people off the unemployment queue, puts them in jobs, causes them not to be beneficiaries of unemployment benefits but contributors to the budget through the paying of tax and fuels 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> other job developments?' The government did not take that approach to the budget. It took a narrow, accountancy approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of that, two major things have happened. The Australian economy has been flat and the budget predictions for growth last year have been undershot. The prediction for growth was 3&frac34; per cent. The growth that was actually obtained was 2.4 per cent. This year, the target for growth is 3&frac34; per cent. The growth that will be obtained will be around three per cent. That is not my view. That is the view of any sample of forecasting economists in both the private and the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we have is a government that has stunned the economy and made it somnolent. Despite any number of interest rate cuts we might have, the economy has failed to respond. Why is the Australian private sector up in arms against this government? Because the economy is so flat, aggregate demand&mdash;that is, the market which buys the goods and services produced by the private sector&mdash;is flat and people are not consuming. Therefore, production runs have to be slowed down and stopped or stockpiled because there is no-one out there with confidence in the future to buy the goods and services produced. Without that market, no profits are able to be made, no report to shareholders is able to be given about a return on investment and there is a general lack of confidence and leadership. That is exactly the situation in the Australian economy at the first level, the macro level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the micro level, what has happened is that $4 billion dollars worth of industry support has been removed from Australian industry and, at a time when they needed that boost of confidence in order to win markets, they have lost support from the very government they believed would support them. So we find that massive cuts have been made, for example, in research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is one of the most creative countries in the world. We create new knowledge in science and technology well ahead of our population or our GDP. The trick for Australia is to convert that new knowledge into new products and new services. By cutting down incentives for research and development, we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7980"> remove an essential building block to creating products or services which the market of the future will consume. That means that Australian manufacturers and exporters are unable to produce products which can hold their place in the market and we then decline as an economic power in the region. You cut research and development and creativity and the ability to be competitive with new ideas and new products in the marketplace are affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Did the Australian government take any view about research and development, about how we build on our science excellence to create products for the new age in the next millennium? Yes, they did; they took a negative view and cut the funding. We now see that rather than $800 million&hyphen;odd being spent on R&amp;D&mdash;and it would have been spent had our government policies remained in place&mdash;it is now reduced to over $250 million, a reduction of $550 million in research and development, which means a withdrawal of investment in Australia's future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So when I say on the micro&hyphen;economic front, `What has the government done?', what it has done is choke off creativity in the Australian industry sector and put us behind in the race with other powers to capture the markets of this world with our products and processes. It has sat waving goodbye as Australian brands have gone overseas. That is what the Howard government has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have this absolute need for direction and vision for Australian industry. After the wreckage of these cuts was beginning to make itself felt in the economy, there was a wake&hyphen;up call. `We have to have an industry policy,' became the rallying slogan in government ranks. So they commissioned the Mortimer report and the Goldsworthy report. They did that out of recognition that they did not have an industry policy and did not understand the needs of industry. While keeping some remnants of our policy, they decided to create one of their one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this is happening, industry awaits direction. Opportunities that could have existed are forgone and there is an interruption in industry strategic planning for growth 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> while they wait to find out what the government wants to do to lead the economy. The trouble is, these reports, which took time and are impressive, have been delivered and we have been waiting four months for a response from the government. Not just members of this parliament but Australian industry leaders want to know what the government response is to these reports so that they can plan their growth targets for next year, how they can take advantage of any government programs to create new investment and what will be their strategy for getting into international markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When they do that, they will know how many jobs they can take on next year. But the government cannot make up its mind what to do. We have continual leaking from the public service in Canberra about one government department fighting a turf battle with another government department over who shall take over what type of program and whether or not one department will win that battle&mdash;arm wrestling between bureaucrats&mdash;while industry growth in Australia stagnates and jobs are put on the backburner. That is exactly the scenario we face right now. That is why bodies like the Business Council, like the government's favourite business mates, the ACCI, and others are very critical of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a presentation of an opposition view; this is the opposition putting a view which is representative of Australian industry which now feels disenchanted and unled by the direction of this government, industry that was so moved by the concern that it commissioned, at considerable expense to itself, the MTIA report, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Make or break</EMPHASIS> report, a report in which Australian metal manufacturers ask the question, `How will this economy be made or how will this economy be broken?' They have put down a series of recommendations which they too expect the Australian government to respond to. What has been the response? A deafening silence has been the response because the government cannot make up its mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot have a situation where the economy drifts, where jobs are not created and where the circumstances that face Aus 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7981"> tralian industry, unable to plan for its future, remain. That is why this motion ought to be carried in the Senate today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I want to say about the 1996&hyphen;97 budget and, indeed, the budget brought down this year&mdash;the 1997&hyphen;98 budget&mdash;is that both budgets have a common thread: massive cuts to public expenditure across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board. When one looks at the reasonings behind these cuts, one comes to this conclusion&mdash;and it is said in black print in the budget documents&mdash;that that may mean a temporary slow&hyphen;down in domestic economic growth because of a reduction in demand in the Australian economy. But the international economy is still strong and, because Australia is a trading nation, international economic growth will pull us through and the impact will not be as great.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not a perfect quote, but is a fair summary of what those documents say. Because we have knocked flat the Australian economy we will, nonetheless, hitch our wagon to the stronger international economies and be pulled along by them, and that is where the growth will come from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the international scene for a moment, because the budget strategy that underpins what has occurred here has now been knocked into a cocked hat. The American economy is the strongest in the world at the moment. It is a healthy economy, and it is the locomotive of world economic growth. It is going well and it is an important trading partner for Australia. But bear in mind that the Americans are beating up on Japan and China because the trade deficits between the US and Japan, and the US and China are too great.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trade deficit between Australia and the United States is greater in percentage of GDP terms than the trade deficit between the US and the other two countries. Do we hear the Australian government taking the initiative to Washington in order to open up the markets in the United States for Australian products in the way that Washington is to Tokyo and Beijing for US products? Where is the Minister for Trade, Tim Fischer? He is in the Vatican getting his hat blessed; he is down in Madrid talking to the King of Spain. What is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> he doing in Washington to open up these markets? He has not been there recently, and he is not doing anything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The European economy is the other major economy in the world that is not going all that well. Again, we have a trade deficit with Europe: they buy less from us than we buy from them. The European economies are jogging along at about 2&half; per cent growth and they have high levels of unemployment. They themselves are searching for an answer in the present circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we turn to Asia. The first thing one must say about Asia is that, currently, South&hyphen;East Asia has been plunged into a currency crisis. The bubble in property in Thailand has burst. The Thai baht is in free fall against the US dollar, and there is a massive devaluation, in excess of 30 per cent, going on in Thailand. That contagion has been caught in Indonesia which, like Thailand, has now put itself in the hands of the International Monetary Fund. That is to say, if you were a private company, you have put yourself in the hands of the receivers. That is what Thailand and Indonesia have done. They have put themselves in the hands of the IMF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same contagion affects Malaysia and, to a lesser extent, the Philippines. We have seen devaluations in their currencies of over 30 per cent. What does that mean to Australia? Our currency is sound and I have great confidence in it. But what does that mean to Australia? It means that the products manufactured in those countries are cheaper than they were yesterday, they can come into Australia at cheaper prices, thereby undercutting Australian products in our markets. That is the first effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second effect is that imports cost more money in the domestic economies of the countries affected by massive currency devaluation. In ASEAN countries, where you have tariff barriers of around 30 per cent, with a currency devaluation of 30 per cent, you now effectively have a tariff barrier of 60 per cent. Australian products trying to be sold into those markets have a higher barrier to leap over. The higher price of imports into those countries means high inflation for them as well as a depression of living standards. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7982"> They are facing very difficult times. Because these are key markets for Australia, and they will buy less goods from Australia, the reliance on international economic strengths to overcome the cuts to the Australian domestic economy is not there to the extent that Treasury thought it was when it wrote the budgets in 1996 and 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me demonstrate the proposition that domestic economic demand is down, but international economic demand will pull Australia through. That was a theory. Domestic economic demand remains down but world economic demand, while strong in the United States, is slack in Europe and down in Asia. So we are not being pulled through, and the expectations for stronger growth in the latter part of this year and early next year have to be seen against the impact of the currency crisis in Asia. At the same time as we are pushing along at a very slow level, imports from that region of the world will be cheaper in our markets thereby displacing jobs in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ask yourself: what is the government's reaction to that? Again, there is a silence. Is there a comprehensive plan on behalf of the government to deal with that? No, there is not. Where is Tim Fischer? What is he doing about opening up those economies, working with the International Monetary Fund that is helping to rescue those economies, lowering the level of tariff barriers so that they can overcome the problem of the lack of confidence in their currencies and creating a more level playing field in this region with lower tariffs, and opening up those economies to the world, in the way in which the IMF wants to take them? What are we doing about arguing that? Have we been out there? No, we have not.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and Coonan. Senator Cook, how wrong can you be? Let me start with a quote from Graham Richardson which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>  this year. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The greatest failure of successive Labor governments from 1983 to 1996 was the failure to develop a coherent industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Cook, you have criticised the government for its budget measures of last year. But what have the industry reports been saying? He was critical of the government for not responding urgently to those reports, but the government is doing so. Let me start with the summary of the recommendations from the MTIA report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Make or break</EMPHASIS> . It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Continue to deliver good macro&hyphen;economic results.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Fundamental tax reform.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What was this government's first priority when it came to power? It was getting the macro&hyphen;economic settings right. As the report says, it is the highest priority. The Mortimer report says the same thing, that we should get the fundamentals right. That is what we have done; that is what we have delivered. Those reports were demanding that we should have a stable economic environment for business investment, for encouraging jobs. That means low inflation, and that has led to low interest rates. Why did we do it? We did it because of the mess left behind by the Labor government. They were the big spenders. They are the big taxers. Pity the poor taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me again quote some figures, and remind the Senate and the community of the last four years of the Labor government when tax revenue was up 30 per cent. Which business had a 30 per cent increase in revenue over that four&hyphen;year period? The then Commonwealth government. It sold off the silver&mdash;$9 billion worth of assets: Qantas and half the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;and then it went out and borrowed another $70 billion, and spent the lot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time the then government had the hide to tell the community that the government was running in surplus. The then government confused the community. Basically, it would not come clean as to the exact state of the accounts. When we came into power we found out that, instead of being in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7983"> surplus, as they claimed, we were actually $10 billion in deficit. What did that mean? It meant that the then Labor government had spent $10 billion more than it got in. That is what was going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every household knows that you cannot go on spending more than you get in. You just cannot do that. You cannot rely on selling the house or selling the furniture to pay for the groceries. It does not work. So we in the new government had to cut programs across the board to meet the $10 billion deficit. The cuts virtually had to be across most programs to reduce the cost of the administration of government. Of course, some of the industry programs were cut. Everyone had to take some pain in order to get the macro&hyphen;economic variables right. As <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Make or break</EMPHASIS> says, we have got to get the macro settings right. That is the first priority. We have done that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What constraints were there on economic growth in Australia in the past? The constraints were inflation and the current account deficit. Those constraints were stopping Australia's future growth. Inflation is now well and truly under control, and the current account deficit is coming under control. The very low inflation is a great encouragement for investment. A stable, low inflation environment really does encourage wise investment. It certainly discourages speculative investment, which happens in periods of high inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interest rates, as a consequence, have come down from the very high rates that we had in the Labor era to the lowest in about 30 years. Since we have been in government, which is only 18 months, official interest rates have come down 2&half; per cent. Housing rates have come down four per cent. Ten&hyphen;year bonds are currently at the extraordinarily low level of 6.3 per cent. The risk premium on 10&hyphen;year bonds&mdash;US 10&hyphen;year bonds versus Australian 10&hyphen;year bonds&mdash;is now close to zero. It was 2.2 per cent higher when Mr Keating was in power. In other words, the world now judges us to be a safe place to invest money, relative to the USA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party was dishonest and said we were in surplus. It turned out that we were actually running at a loss. What has this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government done? We have made commitments to change the financial reporting system so that that can never happen again. The community will never be misled. We have made a commitment. We are in the process of adopting accrual accounting, whole of government reporting; in other words, a balance sheet for government. The charter of budget honesty, which sets the scene, will produce openness and transparency for all in the long&hyphen;term future. As I said before, the macro&hyphen;economic settings are the government's first priority. We have fixed inflation and we have fixed interest rates. That is what this government demanded, and that is what this government has delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What else has this government done for the business community in the short time of 18 months? It has delivered reform in industrial relations. We needed a change in industrial relations in order to get away from the `us' and `them' attitude of the past; to encourage managers and workers to come to agreement within the workplace and work cooperatively together. That is what we have to achieve. We have changed the legislation to encourage that situation, but perhaps not as far as we would have liked to go. It is absolutely criminal that the Labor Party and the Democrats have stopped the government's unfair dismissal legislation going through the Senate, because it offered further incentives to free up the labour market for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another positive thing that we have done is signal a change to the Corporations Law. We also recently signalled that we will change the fundraising regime&mdash;particularly as it applies to the small end of business&mdash;for raising equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tax is the next big business issue. Major reports have emphasised that we have got to fix the tax regime. What is Labor's policy on tax? They are running away from it. They do not want to have anything to do with tax reform. We have already made a substantial change in tax for the small business arena. We have given capital gains tax relief to small business. We are allowing rollovers for small business of up to $5 million from one business into another. As an incentive we will allow people selling their business to use up 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7984"> to half a million dollars from the sale, free of capital gains tax, for retirement purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced two months ago that tax is the next major business issue that this government will address. We are looking forward, not backwards like the Labor Party. The tax system in Australia is in a mess&mdash;there is no doubt about that. It discourages investment, it discourages jobs, it discourages exports and it is basically unfair. The government has signalled that we want to change that system and we will do so. The system is basically unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add that the wholesale sales tax that we currently have is basically a tax on manufacturers because services are not touched at all. It is manufacturers who are hardest hit by the wholesale sales tax. We basically need a broad based indirect tax, and that is being addressed by the government. The government is committed to tax reform, which is the No. 2 issue for business, to encourage investment, growth and jobs for our children and our grandchildren. The government is also committed to no increase in the overall tax burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) again emphasised the Consultative Task Force on Taxation, of which I am proud to be the chair. I propose to seek leave to table a copy of the press release by the Treasurer, which sets out that we are seeking submissions from the community on, firstly, what is wrong with the tax system and, secondly, any proposals for change.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, not much. Senator Bishop, you were present yesterday when Alan Oxley gave a speech in the library. As he said, the manufacturing industry is doing well in Australia. Let me quote the statistics. Manufacturing exports are currently greater than agricultural exports. Elaborately transformed manufacturing exports have been growing at 15 per cent a year for the last 10 years, and they continue to grow. If things are growing, why does it need to be changed? All exports are growing at half that rate&mdash;eight per cent&mdash;and, as Mr Oxley said yesterday, about half of the elaborately transformed exports have zero help from the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many particular industries are claiming that they want government help, but who is going to pay? Who are you going to suggest pays the bill for additional support? Who are you going to tax? Are the battlers going to pay more to pay a particular industry? We are suggesting that the emphasis has to be on education and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is, as the Cutler report points out, that the thing that we are really competitive in in a world sense is the excellence of our people, particularly in the technical arena, in information technology and engineering. We are world class and very economical by world standards. They are the things we have to be encouraging, and that is where we need encouragement, and I am sure the government will do something about encouraging that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few people from both sides were in Ireland recently. There has been huge investment in Ireland. Whilst the world believes that this has been largely tax driven, I do not believe that that is so. The government's IDA reported that it believed that a lot of the investment is because a lot of the investors, especially from North America, regard Ireland as an easy entry into Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people in Ireland are well educated. There is emphasis on the three R's in education and, what is more, they even teach grammar in schools in Ireland. The tax breaks that are available in Ireland were seen as a bonus beyond that, but they were not the fundamentals driving the investment. They are the messages for Australia. We cannot match those tax breaks because the Labor Party has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7985"> committed us and we do not have any spare taxes, unless you can suggest who we should tax. We cannot do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the information technology industry, the government has accepted the recommendations and has appointed a minister for the information economy. The National Office of Information Economy is in the process of being set up. With regard to R&amp;D, Senator Cook claims that the government has slashed industrial R&amp;D from $820 million in 1995&hyphen;96 to $286 million this current year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This reduced figure is only a reflection of the estimated cost to revenue of the tax concession for R&amp;D which reflects the government's decision to abolish the Labor Party's syndication scheme, which was basically being rorted. It is not an accurate reflection of expenditure on R&amp;D because it completely ignores the government's new R&amp;D start program and the innovation investment fund, both of which will provide about $520 million over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the government has stuck to the fundamentals. It has fixed the macro&hyphen;economic settings for business. It is about to tackle taxation, which is the highest priority for business, to encourage investment, to get investment going, and to provide jobs for our children and our grandchildren.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last 18 months have been a low point for industry policy and particularly for businesses involved in manufacturing industry. The Democrats have stood shoulder to shoulder with industry groups to oppose very damaging short&hyphen;sighted cuts to vital industry policy programs such as the R&amp;D tax concessions, bounties, the export market development grant scheme, the DIFF scheme and the imposition of a three per cent duty on imported business inputs that previously entered duty free.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have described these sorts of policies as not about avoiding picking winners but rather as picking on winners. The coalition government's view, certainly in the first 18 months, has been that if a program worked it would cut it back because expenditure was no longer needed. That is a singularly short&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">sighted policy which has affected jobs, investment and growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This view, which is known as the Treasury view, that the best thing government can do for industry is absolutely nothing, in line with an extreme view of how the market works, is simply out of step with international best industry policy practice. It is out of step with the policies and experiences of those countries with successful industry policy and impressive economic and jobs growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats and the Senate have had some successes in minimising the damage the coalition has sought to inflict. For example, the Senate&mdash;and I draw your attention to particularly me, Senator Cook and Senator Harradine&mdash;did succeed in extending the shipbuilding bounty and preventing the abolition of book, machine tools and robotics bounties ahead of schedule. We did succeed in retaining eligibility of trusts and airfares under the EMDG scheme. We are currently pressuring the government to tighten and improve Australia's anti-dumping legislation, and I expect we will be successful in that area. Anti-dumping is an area in which hopefully the government is moving in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have welcomed the outcomes focused approach adopted by Mortimer and the MTIA reports and their endorsement of the view that governments can and should be involved in pro&hyphen;business, investment enhancing, jobs friendly policies. We look forward to the moist or the damp group of the coalition actually triumphing over the hard and dry people who predominated in the first 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope for the sake of the 800,000 unemployed, the long-term unemployed and the 500,000 underemployed Australians that the government does listen to Mortimer and other hands&hyphen;on campaigners and reverses its hands&hyphen;off policy directions of the last 18 months, especially in the areas of innovation, investment and job creation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short time available I will do a quick stocktake of some of the key developments that we think are important. One of the most deplorable actions undertaken by the coalition has been the savage cuts to business R&amp;D 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7986"> assistance. Time and time again I, Senator Cook and other senators have asked: have you done a cost&hyphen;benefit analysis? What does the ledger tell you will be the effects on jobs, investment and growth of these actions? Regrettably, the coalition persisted with the view that business R&amp;D assistance should be cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that less than two per cent of Australian based firms invest in R&amp;D, given that our regional neighbours are achieving substantially higher annual average growth rates in business R&amp;D expenditure, given that Australian business investment in R&amp;D has peaked at only 0.7 cent of GDP, which is far less than developed countries such as Japan, the USA and Switzerland, to name three, each of which invests around two per cent&mdash;nearly three times that of Australia&mdash;of GDP per year in business research and development, the short-sighted nature of the government's R&amp;D decisions cannot be overestimated&mdash;short-term budget revenue gains for long-term jobs, investment and growth damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Investing in R&amp;D is crucial to ensuring sustainable growth, improving our export performance, improving our intellectual capital and reversing the brain drain of some of our best and brightest in the academic, scientific and business world. Few disagree now but the decision to wind back R&amp;D assistance was one of the coalition's worst decisions. Even the Industry Commission, which we all know the Democrats believe is a dry and hardline economic rationalist think tank, did support the 150 per cent tax concession for R&amp;D.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor rightly sought to prevent the cuts to the 150 per cent tax concession scheme, but it wrongly sought to defend the R&amp;D syndication scheme. The R&amp;D syndication scheme did boost R&amp;D investment levels but there were serious doubts about its cost-effectiveness. There were also clear suggestions that the scheme was being manipulated by some of the major financial institutions. Allegations of creative accounting were widespread.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party needed to acknowledge that a scheme that it had developed and implemented was not cost-effective and was possibly being manipulated. Labor was and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> remains still too close to its spell in government to admit this. Labor often remains unable to accept that the new government, the coalition government, not only has a right but has a duty to constantly review industry assistance programs and to improve, replace and even abolish programs which are not effective or not sufficiently effective. That is not our problem. The problem is that the government cut; it did not create.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government did not simply abolish the syndication scheme. At least this time the government cut something and did replace it. It replaced it with the Start program, and for this we supported the government, as did Labor, I seem to recall. However, I am not convinced that the Start program is adequate, and I believe our whole package of R&amp;D assistance schemes needs to be reviewed, overhauled and boosted. The Democrats do not want a mere return to the programs that Labor had in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not all those programs still need to be alive today, although some, such as the EMDG scheme, were outstanding and need to be given the approbation they deserve. If Labor at times appears guilty of blindly supporting its old programs, even if they are suspect, it must recognise that it can bring disrepute to the argument that industry assistance programs and active interventionist methods are necessary. That can be seen to be support for a partisan view, not for a policy measure which has integrity in its own right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many instances when government intervention is warranted, when market forces left to themselves will not deliver outcomes most beneficial to the community. I mean `community' in the broader sense&mdash;the business, social and national community. But if parties such as Labor&mdash;a party which is the alternative government&mdash;can actually publicly defend inefficient and potentially manipulated programs, then the public and the key opinion makers will lack confidence in government intervention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another appalling decision was the government's move to abolish tariff concessions on business imports. The tariff concession system allowed products to be imported  duty free if there was no equivalent Australian manufac 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7987"> tured product. The rationale was that tariffs existed to protect Australian industries and should not apply to goods where there was no local industry to protect. The decision to abolish it caused understandable fury within industry. To his credit, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, John Moore, recognised how stupid this decision was and described it as `dreadful policy'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where did the idea come from? Regrettably, it came from the Labor Party. The motion before us today says that the government has failed to come up with any initiatives on industry policy apart from those it took from the ALP. Well that is one you should not have given them. After intense lobbying from industry, which was supported by the Democrats in their lobbying, the government eventually adopted the inept compromise of effectively imposing a three per cent tariff on previously exempt business imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry minister described this as the best outcome under difficult circumstances. What he did not mention was the difficult circumstances were the dry as dust hard boys in the cabinet. It was a pathetic outcome and the difficult circumstances refer to the complete ineptitude of a cabinet full of lawyers and of the Labor opposition's inability to accept that that recommendation had been wrong. Labor then completely ignored the impact on business. They wanted to impose a five per cent tariff. When the three per cent tariff came in, the Labor industry spokesperson, Simon Crean, then launched a campaign against the impact that these changes would have for consumer goods, but there was not a mention about the impact on business imports that I can find or recall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Business warned that the changes were likely to render the scheme ineffective because claiming back the two per cent value on goods would not be worthwhile. No-one but the Democrats in the Senate took this seriously. Regrettably, it has since been revealed that applications for tariff concessions have fallen by more than two-thirds from 3,273 in 1995-96 to 1,029 in 1996&hyphen;97. This has borne out the fact that a good proportion of industry complaints were not just rhetoric but justified.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us now turn to the issue of tariffs. Both Labor and the coalition are running around as the Latter&hyphen;day Saints of tariff reductions. Regrettably, they get more media exposure than we do so we are not getting the contrary view across. All of a sudden, both appeared to have discovered that unilateral tariff reductions means job losses. Yet, for a decade and a half of Labor governments who were fully supported in this by the coalition, it was the Democrats alone who strongly opposed the unilateral&mdash;and I emphasise unilateral&mdash;cuts in tariffs, quotas and bounties pursued and implemented by Labor. The coalition simply cheered them on. In other words, Labor and the coalition stood together as the conservative group supporting unilateral cuts in tariffs, quotas and bounties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The media have been vigorous in promoting the view that the government and Labor have had an about&hyphen;face on tariffs. That they ignored the Industry Commission reports into both the car and textile, clothing and footwear industries was commendable, but this was not an about&hyphen;face; it was simply a slowing down. The economic cheer squad&mdash;those favouring tariff reductions&mdash;have been scathingly critical of the government for slowing tariff cuts while other media commentators catering for Howard's battlers came out cheering that John Howard froze tariffs and saved jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But did the government and Labor really ignore the Industry Commission? Have they really done an about&hyphen;face on tariffs? We do not think so. With the aid of the media, the government has been able to perpetrate a major hoax on the Australian public because tariffs have not been frozen. It has not given up the goal of unilateral tariff reductions. Tariffs in the car industry are currently falling at a rate of 2&half; per cent a year and at a rate of three per cent a year for the TCF industries, and they will continue to do so. By the year 2000, they will have fallen to a maximum rate of 15 per cent for the car industry and 25 per cent for the TCF industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These reductions are set to take place irrespective of what our trading partners do and irrespective of their impact on employment and investment in Australia, and that is our complaint. To adopt the Democrats' 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7988"> policy you would have to adopt the policy of reciprocity, and you have not. You have maintained the policy of unilateral reductions. We think it is dangerous policy considering the car industry directly employs 22,000 people and TCF industries directly employ up to 100,000 people and a further equivalent number, it is understood, of outworkers. Hundreds of thousands of employees and families are indirectly affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the Liberal, Labor and National parties are still fundamentally opposed to reviewing these decisions. The recent decisions in both the car and TCF industries only deal with tariffs after the year 2000. So what we have in the tariff decisions is a change in timing, not a change in direction. Do they stop tariff reductions? No. On the contrary, the government has decided to unilaterally&mdash;and, once again, I emphasise the word `unilaterally'&mdash;reduce both car tariffs and TCF tariffs by the year 2005. We say it should be a reciprocal view we take relative to our competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By 2005, the maximum tariff rate within TCF industries will be 17&half; per cent, and this will apply to clothing and finished textiles. Other TCF products will have a maximum rate between five per cent and 10 per cent, regardless of what our competitors have or do. Isn't that the most astonishing thing&mdash;regardless of what our competitors have or do?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the car industry tariffs will fall to 10 per cent in 2005&mdash;again, regardless of what our competitors have or do. Whether this occurs in one step as the government proposes or as a series of steps as the Industry Commission proposes is largely irrelevant. The end result is much the same. The end result is that tariffs are eroded unilaterally. The end result is that our tariffs will continue falling unilaterally while no regard is given to what our trading partners do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unilateral tariff reductions are to continue through to the year 2000 and on to the year 2005. They will occur in one step rather than in yearly steps as recommended by the commission. If anything, the supporters of unilateral tariff reduction should be elated. They are getting their tariff reductions but at the same 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> time the battlers are cheering. The battlers have been deceived into believing that there has been a reversal on tariff policy. But still, every month, every year, the industries and the factories close down and the jobs are lost. For example, 275,000 full-time jobs have been lost every year for the last decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When are you going to accept that economic rationalism does not deliver the goods? You have the evidence before you. All that has occurred is that the tariff reductions have been packaged slightly differently, a temporary pause slotted in and that is all. Do not get me wrong&mdash;we at least welcome that, but it is not far enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor are claiming victory. They are saying that the government have adopted their policy. The coalition are claiming victory. They are saying, `Look at what we have done for jobs.' But there is no difference really between the Labor Party and the coalition on this because they both accept the same dry economic dogma. Both the government and Labor have remained committed to the Industry Commission view. Both Labor and the coalition have been like minded on tariffs for the past two decades. The Democrats have stood apart. Only the Democrats have consistently remained opposed to unilateral disarmament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition have faltered badly. They have failed to respond to growing job insecurity, especially for those workers in manufacturing. They have failed on their election promise to create 200,000 new manufacturing jobs. They have failed to adopt both economic and job growth targets. They have failed to adopt an industry policy which is comprehensible. What they have adopted is an intention to pursue macro and micro policy and macro and micro reform. That has a place. Without doubt, some of it will be good. Some of it will be bad, from our point of view. But we need an industry vision and direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats&mdash;along with the Labor Party when they have voted with us&mdash;have been able to minimise some of the damage that the coalition has sought to inflict. I assure the Senate that the Democrats will continue pressuring the government to deliver an activist, interventionist, strategic industry policy. We will continue to pressure the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7989"> Labor Party to start to move away from the economic rationalist dogma they have so wrongly pursued over the last decade.

Congratulations to Senator Gibson and others who have taken the time to spend their whole contribution on this critical debate about industry policy and cuts to all of the elements that support industry in this country to talk about macro&hyphen;economic policy and tax reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at this motion, we go far beyond those two points and start looking at the substance of what is going wrong. What is the malaise in the Australian economy? The malaise lies in the heart of this government's inability to provide direction, focus, support and strategically applied incentives in a consistent manner to allow business to have confidence to grow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We find ourselves in a situation where we have five reports on industry policy. Why do we have five reports that have come down all at once? You do not need to look too far beyond those reports to see why. Just about every one of them articulates the lack of leadership in this country as a prime reason why industry policy is floundering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of leadership, of vision, is something that was largely avoided in the election campaign. Whilst we had all the rhetoric about business being the jobs growth engine of our economy, there was no substance, and we have 18 months of government to prove that there is no substance and a proliferation of reports to try to put the substance where leadership is lacking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's inability to acknowledge the important and successful structures and schemes that were put in place under Labor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7990"> is an indication of the way that it is prepared to play petty politics with this critical issue. So many times we have seen areas of government support&mdash;be it in regional economic development, research and development incentives or anything else&mdash;cut back or ditched altogether and then re&hyphen;emerge in a repackaged, liberalised version of a support mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are starting to see hints of that now. We are starting to see backdowns. We are starting to see Goldsworthy, in his report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The global information economy: the way ahead</EMPHASIS>, talk about reinstating a R&amp;D incentive for business in a slightly different way. We are going through a process of repackaging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is this responsible government? Is it responsible to take away what had been developed over a long period and had evolved to support industries&mdash;whether it be partnerships for development or the EMDG programs&mdash;and reshape and repackage them? What you have done is squander 18 months of growth. You have denied our economy who knows how many percentage points of growth through your cutbacks in this area. Ostensibly you have done all of this for the purpose of the macro&hyphen;economic measures to which Senator Gibson alluded but more covertly you have done all this to repackage it in a way which is based on pure political opportunism. You have denied this country 18 months of what should have been a pathway of expansion&mdash;a pathway of growth of R&amp;D investment as a proportion of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken in this chamber before about the relationship between R&amp;D investment in business and economic growth and jobs. We know that there are a number of scenarios. We know that there is a path on which Australia was travelling under Labor. It was a path of growth and improvement. We know that there was an enhanced scenario which meant that if the government put more focus on that area of policy it would result in even greater growth. But what we saw this government do is ignore all of that information&mdash;it is all there on the public record&mdash;and cut those very programs, knowingly denying that growth and restricting the opportunities for Australian businesses and hence jobs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to turn to a specific area which I have great interest in. It goes to the heart of two significant industry reports that have been presented in the area of information technology and services. Both the Goldsworthy's report entitled<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> The global information economy: the way ahead</EMPHASIS> and the IPAC report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A national policy framework for structural adjustment within the new Commonwealth of information </EMPHASIS>really start to articulate what was a glaring deficiency in the make&hyphen;up of the government's frontbench.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to look at the development of the recognition of information technology as a policy issue of substance by this government. It has taken quite some time for them to realise that the fastest growing global industry is of some importance to Australia. It has taken them quite some time to realise that what we have, or what we had, is a critical opportunity to position Australia to ensure that we have claim to at least a proportion of what is currently the second largest industry on the globe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, Senator Alston, was probably the first one to pick it up. It took about six or eight months for him to learn the language and the IT lingo and to start building it into responses to dorothy dixers in the chamber. He has since had a couple of briefings which have upgraded at least the perception of his knowledge of this sector. He has also had some pretty comprehensive advice to back that up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to focus on the Prime Minister, Mr Howard. It was not until Mr Howard got a second dose of what was going on in the US and President Clinton's next generation Internet and other IT initiatives that it finally dawned on Mr Howard that maybe there is some substance to this issue and maybe he had better pay lip&hyphen;service to it back home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When President Clinton visited Australia last year and addressed both houses of parliament in the other place the issue of IT was specifically raised as being critical for Western developed nations in terms of how they approach industry policy. It did not register. He missed it completely. The Prime Minister went over to the US and when he came back 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7991"> he said, `IT is important.' Ding. It took a long time and we suffered as a consequence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think the Treasurer, Mr Costello, is anywhere near realising the importance of this particular policy issue. In his articulation of these macro-economic issues Mr Costello is devoid of any substance and any critical achievement in putting in place an industry policy to back what should be a competitive and growing business environment. He is not going to click to the issues. While he holds sway in cabinet this government is going to be unable to develop industry policy in any successful and meaningful way. Even if he were overridden in cabinet, I do not believe there is the vision, talent or skill amongst the frontbench of this government to actually progress sensible, practical industry policy and to do what is required to be done in this country to resolve some of these issues. So we had this rude awakening to the importance of IT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Research and development is a backdrop to the information technologies, the information services sector. Why? Because it is high-tech. It is the top end. It is a new technology and it requires a significant research and development base to develop at an innovative level. We know Australia will never be at the forefront of hardware manufacturing. We know that, because of the lack of action of this government with respect to software development, opportunities are slipping by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do we see any positive action by this government to promote the remaining opportunities in this area? Do we see increased investment in research and development? Do we see support of cooperative research centres?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, we do not. We see $10 million worth of cuts. Do we see the recommendations from these reports into the development of our IT sector being implemented? No, we do not, because this government has not clicked yet. How long is it going to take? Meanwhile, these opportunities are flying by.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue I would like to mention about IT is the role of government procure 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment. In Australia it is reasonable to say that government procurement has a far greater level of importance in terms of a Western economy because of the nature of our industry. We do not have a critical mass of large industry in Australia. We are predominantly small to medium enterprises in terms of our profile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So how do our companies export? How do they grow and innovate and look outwards globally? One of the key mechanisms for these companies to build an export base is to build up some credential, and the biggest contracts available are in the government sector. When we talk about outsourcing Commonwealth information technologies, we are talking about giving away the ability for these companies to create credentials for themselves so that they can enter into the global market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole way that this IT outsourcing process has been managed&mdash;and I have spoken about this issue many times in this chamber&mdash;is doing great damage to local SMEs. The government are ignoring that clamouring, and the small movement that they have tried to implement&mdash;there was a particular industry development section inserted into the cluster 3 request for tender&mdash;shows that, even when the industry knocks on their door and tells them what the problems are, the government cannot get it right. They have a singular focus on outsourcing, and it is to save money. Forget the impact on local business, forget the impact on innovation, forget the impact of taking away the platform or the opportunities upon which Australian companies base their credentials for exports; that is, how they sell themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Have a look at what this government is doing in this area and you start to see a comprehensive package of undermining the innovative end, the interesting end, the end that could position Australia in a very significant and useful way with leading edge technologies. This issue is not over yet; it is still going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to take the time to make reference to what the member for Mackellar, Mrs Bishop, said in the other place today in response to a question from the member for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7992"> Lindsay (Miss Kelly). It is worth raising in this context because, on the issue of IT outsourcing, we have heard some very specific comments from the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) about what they are trying to achieve. They are trying to save money; they are trying to position multinationals in Australia and grow our industry off that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So let us have a look at what Mrs Bishop said in the other place about IT outsourcing. We should remember, too, that the contracts which she is referring to relate to Defence, which happened because of their decision to provide for an in&hyphen;house option bid in their IT outsourcing. Surprise, surprise! The in&hyphen;house bid was the successful one. So, here we go. Mrs Bishop states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recently announced tender is that relating to CRISP, which is part of the Russell redevelopment program. It is concerning the overall computing infrastructure desktop hardware and standard office operating products for Russell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importance of this contract is that, firstly, it is a $27 million contract of which $8.8 million&mdash;or about 30 per cent of the contract for systems integration&mdash;will go directly to Australian small and medium enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Well, well, well. She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, there is another $6 million which will go to IPEX, which will provide desktop devices from its Melbourne manufacturing facility, and its associated printer production of Lexmark will be manufactured in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mrs Bishop goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This contract is also of importance in that it is in accordance with that important principle this government supports that I brought in which says that we require large foreign firms doing business here in Australia not to exclude SMEs by using vertically integrated companies in their tenders but to nurture and look after small and medium enterprises which are Australian, so that Australian individuals get the opportunity to work in these important areas.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Well, well, well. I wonder if Mrs Bishop has been speaking to Mr Fahey lately. I suspect not because this flies directly in the face of everything we have heard from the minister for finance on this issue from day one, when that submission was first put forward to cabinet and supported for the 1997-98 budget. We will continue to observe the mismatched 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ad hoc policy&hyphen;on&hyphen;the&hyphen;run approach to industry development in this critical sector by this government. My only hope is that they are limited in the extent to which they can inflict damage by virtue of our democratic processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look. We have a government scratching around for leadership. We have a proliferation of reports, articulating that very point and providing some solutions, being ignored. We are seeing R&amp;D cuts. We are seeing cuts to education that undermine industry potential in every way. The links are there&mdash;we know they are there&mdash;and the studies have been done. Consistently, this government is undermining the infrastructure that will build those foundations of a sound, solid industry that has strong growth potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the best the government have to offer is focusing on the macro-economic policy settings&mdash;and I am not even convinced that they have a grip on that&mdash;then they are closing their ears to small business. They are closing their ears to what they have described as the jobs growth engine of the future. Are their doors open to only those who are well resourced enough to be able to bend the ear of the relevant ministers? It is a sad day for Australian industry to see that, even with this information around on providing advice and even with the scope and possibilities that are available to them, they are squandering opportunities every day that they are in government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on document No. 5, the Commonwealth Ombudsman's report. I start by complimenting the Ombudsman and her office for the hard work that has been undertaken this year in what have to be increasingly trying circumstances. I quote from chapter 10 of the report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Adequate resources are essential if the Ombudsman's Office is to be effective and fulfil its statutory role.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1996&hyphen;97 has been the busiest year ever for the Ombudsman's Office with over 50,000 approaches to the office&mdash;complaints have increased by 19 per cent over 1995&hyphen;96, and by 61 per cent over the last three years. As the Government implements further changes in administrative practices, it is likely that there will be further increases in the number of complaints to the Ombudsman's Office placing additional pressure on limited resources.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ombudsman's Office has always operated on a shoestring. By international standards the Australian Ombudsman is probably the busiest and most cost effective. The situation is reaching a breaking point, with a dramatic increase in both the demand for the Ombudsman's assistance, and the office's throughput of cases. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been serious consequences, in particular:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the office is being forced to turn away an increasing number of people;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> important functions have been diminished; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> there are signs that confidence in the office is being eroded.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is all because of cuts that this government has made to the Ombudsman's Office. This government obviously does not care to see that there is any scrutiny or any independent body or organisation for individual people with complaints and problems caused by government programs and changes, and for people to seek redress for poor treatment they are getting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The efficacy and the ability of the Ombudsman to do work on this issue are being eroded. For that the government must stand condemned. As much as we might like to say that the public servants do a wonderful job&mdash;and they do on the whole&mdash;there are the difficult cases, the cases that slip through, the cases that are put in the too&hyphen;hard basket, and people are given a hard time. Whilst we as members of parliament are often able to assist people to resolve their problems, referral to the Ombudsman still occurs for an independent, non&hyphen;judgmental assessment of the case, for a judgment to be made and some force to be applied to the errant department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also interesting to note within the report the significant increase in the number of complaints and problems being experienced by the Department of Social Security. One wonders, with these cuts to personnel, just how they are going to cope with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also note that the Deputy Ombudsman Defence position was vacated in 1996 and has not been re&hyphen;filled. The Ombudsman Act provides for up to three deputy ombudsman positions. However, to reduce overheads these positions have been reduced to one, which has eroded specialisation. Of course, with the erosion of specialisation, one then begins to see maybe a diminution in the standard of the decisions being made and the advice being given. It also reduces the strength and the amount of time the Ombudsman's Office has to assist people to rectify problems.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7995">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also turn to the Defence Force Ombudsman report, because this is an area that I have a great deal of interest in over a number of years. This is often the place of last review, particularly for women who have had sexual harassment cases. The Department of Defence is saying that it has done a lot of things to overcome these problems but, from media reports recently, it would appear that that is not the case. The Ombudsman's report on page 239 also raises some serious issues regarding the handling of incidents, which included:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a tendency to investigate complaints (and particularly complaints regarding harassment and discrimination) whether or not an investigation was the most appropriate response;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It also talks about:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the alternative dispute resolution strategies needed to be better integrated into the processes of deciding how to deal with these sorts of complaints;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the widespread use of "informal inquiries" with little guidance on the conduct of such inquiries, and few accountability mechanisms in place to protect the parties involved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is pertinent that I follow Senator West on this issue of the Ombudsman. I am addressing the issue of the Defence Force Ombudsman, because I think the points that Senator West has raised are very important. Whilst Senator West obviously did not have sufficient time to canvass that section of the report, there are some significant issues in the defence area because of the current turmoil that is there, I would imagine, as a result of the Defence Efficiency Review. I am sure the role of the Ombudsman will come into play more often.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator West referred to a number of factors that had been identified as issues relating to the Australian Defence Force's handling of serious incidents. While she mentioned some, she did not move to the fact that there were no procedures for monitoring and quality control of investigations, leading to some going off the rails. That is quite unsatisfactory. Whilst I will refer later on in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> addressing this to the matter of how it seems to have been remedied, it is cause of grave concern that that crops up in a report at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When referring to alternative ways of resolving issues, the report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One problem we identified was a tendency to invoke an investigation under the Defence (Inquiry) Regulations, whether or not this was the most appropriate course for dealing with a complaint.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what Senator West said earlier. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is an intensive and expensive option&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One would have thought an organisation such as the Defence Force would have been very meticulous in the way it handled these cases. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some cases, an investigation will either not solve the problem or will not be the best solution. Although there has been an increased emphasis in recent years on alternative resolution strategies for harassment complaints, the employment of such strategies is still a relatively new concept&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In view of that comment in the report, one would hope we see a changed manner within the defence forces, particularly in respect of the handling of harassment cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further in the report on page 245, there is a very concerning comment about procedural fairness. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the matters of most concern to our office was the lack of adherence by some Defence investigators to the principles of procedural fairness.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One would think that, if we are going to have a fair and just system, we must have procedural fairness. Whilst this comment should not be tagged to all investigators within the defence forces, the report did refer to some investigators failing to follow the principles of procedural fairness. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is a need to ensure that the principles of procedural fairness are spelt out in the relevant Defence instructions and adhered to&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One would hope beyond all hope that that is the case. People who are subjected to investigation&mdash;whether they be in the Defence Force or citizens outside of the Defence Force&mdash;are entitled to fair play. Fairness is one of the hallmarks of our society, and people are entitled to fairness and justice evenhandedly distributed, not with some cooked&hyphen;up investi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7996"> gation techniques used by some Rambo in the Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report finishes the Defence Force Ombudsman section by addressing the fact that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the difficulties the Australian Defence Force has faced with investigations in the past, the Chief of the Defence Force is to be commended for recognising those deficiencies and for taking steps to remedy the Australian Defence Force's policy and procedures.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Because this is mentioned in this report, one would certainly hope to see it reflected in what we see in reality. If we do not see it in reality, one would wonder why these reports are printed and used in the first place.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, respected by the people who exercise the law, if I can take that interjection from Senator O'Chee. One of the great difficulties, as Senator O'Chee will understand, is that the theory is all very good but, when you come to apply it, that is when the difficulty arises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you object to or put in a notice of disallowance of a regulation, departments are not likely to take that kindly. They understand the general proposition that power ought to be exercised responsibly and that arbitrary power ought to be restrained. They understand that general proposition and no doubt accept it, but it is the actual example that brings forward all sorts of concerns. The person who is faced with resistance to the power that he or she exercises tends to say, `I'm doing this in a very reasonable fashion. I shouldn't be criticised.' It is the person who stands up for that citizen and pursues that topic in a proper and right way who suffers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to pay tribute to Philippa Smith, who has acted fairly over the time but, nevertheless, has come up with the resistance that anybody who stands up for the rights of others will come across. I think that is a matter of reality. People who undertake that task are at times unpopular, but that is the way it is played. Even though we recognise that, I think it is proper to say that we should pay people like Philippa Smith due deference when they do what is proper and right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look at the index of this report and the sorts of matters she dealt with: Australia Post, the Australian Defence Force&mdash;and that issue has already been addressed by Senator Hogg and Senator West&mdash;the Australian Federal Police, Austudy, the Child Support Agency and so on. They are all bodies that no doubt try to do the best they can to carry out their duties, but at times they perhaps act in a way that could be labelled as an arbitrary exercise of power. It is proper that we have somebody like Philippa Smith to restrain them, to bring them back to reality so they can get back to properly serving us as citizens and can do what they no doubt intend to do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to take note of the reports 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7997"> of the Nuclear Safety Bureau covering the period 1 January to 31 March 1997 and the next period of 1 April to 30 June 1997. As I think honourable senators know, I live in the electorate of Hughes which contains Australia's only nuclear reactor, namely the Lucas Heights establishment. It is not widely known that two reactors are located there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Moata reactor has been decommissioned but is still on the site in its decommissioning phase, and issues continue with respect to safety and the decommissioning process. The major reactor is the Hifar reactor which is scheduled for shutdown and decommissioning in 2003. As a consequence of that, this government announced recently that it proposes to locate a new replacement reactor for the Hifar reactor at Lucas Heights. We will come to deal with that issue next year when the Senate committee looks at that decision, because there is strong community opposition to that government proposal, and that opposition relates to the question of nuclear safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never been one to come down on the side of total opposition to the mining of uranium in this country. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, the union which I used to work for, the Australian Workers Union, covers most of the workers at the uranium mine in Roxby Downs or Olympic Dam in South Australia, your home state. Also, living in the area I recognise that the reactor was there at Lucas Heights long before I built a home not far away, as many other residents of that area have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is of major concern is, firstly, the fact that we are going to get another reactor to replace it and, more importantly, the attitude that is adopted, particularly by ANSTO, which is reflected in this report; that is, the question of safety. There is genuine concern in the community about safety issues at Lucas Heights. It ranges from those who are moderately concerned to those who are passionately concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very recently there was an incident at Lucas Heights where it has been acknowledged that water was found to have entered the containers containing some of the fuel rods stored there. The report came out from 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ANSTO, and you really have to dig deep to find it&mdash;I will come to the way these reports are produced in a minute&mdash;saying that rain water had seeped into the containers containing the fuel rods. It defies one's imagination, to the normal person in the community, how rainwater could have got in, given that these containers are encased in quite thick concrete. I want to quote from page 2 of the first report because what really concerns people is that these reports are couched in such scientific language that the average person really cannot understand them. They have a right to understand these reports. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Twelve Abnormal Occurrences were reported to the NSB for the period 1 January to 31 March 1997. The Abnormal Occurrences were reviewed by the NSB and it was concluded that none had adverse safety implications. Ten Abnormal Occurrences were due to equipment fault, one was human factors related and one was not classified as to cause. Two of the occurrences involved unavoidable non&hyphen;compliance with Operational Limits and Conditions, and the NSB agreed to temporary exemptions in these cases. The NSB continued to assign levels on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES)2 to HIFAR Abnormal Occurrences on a trial basis.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst this report is not wildly exciting, the reason for raising it is that it mentions a study going on under the auspices of the Judge Advocate General. That report was due out in June 1997. To date, I have not seen the report&mdash;I would be interested in reading it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the report, the office of the Judge Advocate General was created to police and enforce the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982. The functions under that act include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . making procedural rules for Service tribunals, providing final legal review of proceedings within the Australian Defence Force . . . and reporting 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7998"> upon the operation of laws relating to the discipline of the ADF.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Point 5 of the preamble to the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JAG's duty is also perceived as including the promotion of the jurisprudential welfare and education of the ADF together with the exercise of a beneficial influence upon the legal structures within it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is terribly important. It is one thing to say that we can have discipline&mdash;and it gets back to the issue that I raised before: it is the fact that it has to be applied fairly and equitably; otherwise the application of any discipline is seen to be harsh and oppressive. At point 6 it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JAG should not,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">in the opinion of this report&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">act as a general legal adviser to the ADF as that would be inconsistent with judicial office.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In reading the report, it was also interesting to find out that legal training and military legal education are now being given to civilian lawyers who act for the Judge Advocate General. Obviously, this can only be a plus for the defence forces. In particular, they are grounded in matters peculiar to military service, including military discipline law, international law and operations law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This led to a study being commissioned. The Chief of the Defence Force tasked the Deputy Judge Advocate to conduct a study into the arrangements for the conduct of military trials, with a view to determining whether these arrangements satisfy current tests of judicial independence and impartiality. This is a very laudable and praiseworthy thing that we are seeing take place; that we can be assured that the legal processes within the military stand up to any test against what happens out in the real civilian world. The Deputy Judge Advocate was also to recommend any changes if necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The study was also to look at the military justice systems in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada and to compare those systems with that of Australia. As I said earlier, the report was expected in June this year. To date, to my knowledge, no such report has been forthcoming. When this report appears, it will be interesting to see the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> impact it has on the legal system as it applies within our military forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another interesting point is that the report concluded that `the state of discipline within the Australian Defence Force continues to be good'. One would hope that there will be no rebellions in the near future. One must say, though, that one would have to be concerned at the impact the Defence Efficiency Review is having on morale. Let us hope that does not impact on the whole state of discipline within the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Veterans' Review Board is a very important organisation. This is one of the organisations that the government has been planning to merge, along with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal, into a single tribunal called the Administrative Review Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is something that the opposition has grave concerns about, and we have expressed them on previous occasions. We see a need for the independence of these tribunals, that they be kept away from departments, so that they can review, as they are supposed to do, in an objective, non&hyphen;judgmental and arms&hyphen;length manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we read the overview of this report, we find that the government&mdash;as with so many other things&mdash;has not been able to make up its mind about appointments. It would appear that the Veterans' Review Board is no different, because we have had a change of Principal Member. The appointment of Mr John Gallagher, who had been the Principal Member, ended on 5 February 1997 and, by that stage, the process for a Principal Member had not been concluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a bit unusual, because it has not been the practice to have a significant number of principal members. In fact, there have only 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7999"> been two since 1985. It would have been fairly apparent to the government when they came to power nearly 12 months earlier that this appointment was going to be up for review. However, that did not seem to bother the government. Again, they had to put in place interim measures, and Mr Bill Cook from New South Wales acted until 7 April, when Brigadier Rolfe, retired, was appointed on 8 April for two years. I am sure that those gentlemen will do a very good job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It needs to be brought home to this government that they are continually late in making significant appointments to boards&mdash;to lots of things&mdash;and for that they have to be criticised. This is not the way to promote harmony and efficacy in the administration and working of boards. We saw the same thing happen when the terms of appointment for the other members of the board were due to expire on 31 December 1996. In the case of senior members and members, the appointments had to be extended for six months, and for 12 months for service members. This is just sloppy work on the part of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The advertisements for the senior members and members went out in March 1997. Their term was due to expire in December 1996. It is taking the government a couple of months here and a couple of months there to get their act into gear. I think it is an indication of some sloppy administration. Certainly, the advertisements were well received, and there were a lot of applications. The outcome of the selection process will be a subject of the report at the end of 1997&hyphen;98. It is not good enough for the government to have this sloppy administration attitude, where they cannot get their things ready and up to date; and it is of grave concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The plan to merge the appeal bodies appears to have led the Veterans Review Board into undertaking an internal review of systems and methods of operation in order to ensure that it is armed with current information when eventually it is called upon to assess or apply particular proposals. One has to wonder how much time, effort and energy that is taking up. An IDC has been set up to devise an implementation strategy and it will report to the government by late 1997. One has to

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Civil Aviation Safety Authority of Australia, as I think all senators are aware, was established in 1995 following a restructuring of the authorities that are involved in the regulation of air safety in Australia. Prior to that time, air safety had been exclusively in the control of the Civil Aviation Authority. There was also, of course, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, whose charter was specifically to investigate air safety incidents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators will recall the tragedy of the Seaview disaster and also the Monarch inquiry. Notwithstanding the fact that, over all the years of aviation in this country, we have had a marvellous record in air safety, it was clearly recognised that there were issues that needed to be addressed and that those unfortunate circumstances that I have referred to should not have occurred and may have been avoided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence, the previous government's minister, the member for Kingsford&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8000"> Smith (Mr Brereton), quickly ensured that the regulatory authorities were restructured, and the old CAA had its responsibilities rearranged. Two bodies were established. Airservices Australia was established to look at airport management and such issues as flight path management, and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of Australia was given the specific task of ensuring a continuation of the high standard of air safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the corporate plan, which was released in August 1997 under the hand of the then chairman, Justice Fisher, CASA stated its vision as being:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the aviation community, create an air safety environment which engenders public trust and confidence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is important. In its operations CASA, until recent times&mdash;up until the time that the recently departed minister, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) took over&mdash;was re&hyphen;establishing that enviable reputation of the highest standards of air safety in this country. On page 2 of the corporate plan, the previous&mdash;and only recently resigned&mdash;director of CASA, Mr Leroy Keith said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The core business of CASA is to regulate the safety of civil aviation for the benefit of the Australian public. This represents a fundamental shift from the concept of `the aviation industry' as our `customer', to a primary emphasis on public safety.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, I emphasise the words `public safety'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is well known that in recent months this government, under the then minister, Mr Sharp, prior to his forced removal for other reasons, had turned air safety regulation in this country on its head. In his blind manic pursuit to get a CASA board that would do his and the government's bidding rather than focus upon the issue of public safety, he essentially set out to destroy that board. He sought to have the chairman, Justice Fisher, who quite rightly stood up to him, resign. He then set about trying to stack the board by appointing Dick Smith, the friend of the Liberal Party.

This is where I get out of that one real fast&mdash;but I wish them well in their research!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The topic I want to deal with tonight&mdash;and I started to deal with it the other day, and warned that I would do so again&mdash;is immunisation. I feel extremely strongly about the essential need for children and people in this community to be immunised. I am old enough to remember the poliomyelitis outbreak of 1954&hyphen;55. I am old enough to have lined up as a schoolchild and put out my arm to get the Salk vaccine, which was effective against two of the three strains of polio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am old enough to have also been lined up as a schoolchild to be given the Sabin vaccine, which immunised against the third strain of polio. I am concerned because, reading through the report, I read a profile by Associate Professor Margaret Burgess, who talked about recalling seeing 5,000 people lined up in a street in Melbourne years ago just to get their vaccine. She says that not long ago, in the Soviet Union, there were more than 40,000 cases of diphtheria and nearly 2,000 deaths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have nursed children who have died from diphtheria, and there was absolutely no need for it. I have nursed a tiny baby that had whooping cough, and there was absolutely no need for it. The child was too young to be fully immunised&mdash;it was old enough to have had only one injection but not the full course&mdash;but, because other people had not had their children immunised, this child developed whooping cough. Fortunately, it suffered no side effects. The mother knew very quickly that there was something wrong 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8001"> with her child and took it to hospital, but it spent many days there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me to the decision last week by the government to not allow the use of Infanrix&mdash;which is the DTPA vaccine for the diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough viruses&mdash;in the primary immunisation schedule for babies at two, four and six months of age. It is approved for use in booster doses at 18 months and four and five years of age. It is approved for those doses because triple antigen&mdash;the old one that we all know&mdash;was not able to be given to children at that age because they had reactions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite widely known that children have a number of reactions to triple antigen. These can mostly be settled quite simply with some liquid or paediatric panadol. However, it is of concern to parents. They do not like to see their children with sore arms and upset. It is imperative that the government do everything it can to make available to every baby and every child in this country an injection for these three diseases in a form which is going to cause less discomfort. If you have less discomfort, you have a less unsettled child and you will get greater compliance on the part of parents. But it does not seem to work like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, a number of the states thought that Infanrix&mdash;or whatever they want to call it&mdash;was the superior form of immunisation and a superior vaccine. Places like Western Australia had already gone ahead with the distribution of it and they have now had to let their doctors know that it is no longer available, except where there have been severe side effects and for the older child. If parents wish to immunise their child with Infanrix, they can certainly do so, but the cost will vary between $38 and $65 per dose, to be obtained by prescription. That is three times $38 to $65, because they have to have three of these immunisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the information given by the Western Australian department of health, it is apparent that the adverse events within two days of immunisation between the two drugs are different. For Infanrix, for local swelling it was only about 8.9 per cent, while for triple antigen it was 25 per cent. For local tender 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ness, it was 4.5 per cent for Infanrix and 29 per cent for triple antigen. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

As honourable senators know, if we are to be one of the world's finest food exporting nations, we have to be at the cutting edge of research into the products which we produce.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sort of research I am talking about is not just research in terms of improved resistance to disease or pests, nor is it just things like improved research into markets. A whole range of things that we do are important to research: from improving genetic varieties, resistance to disease, management practices on farms, and the handling of goods after they leave the farm, to researching the market to ensure that what we are producing is what the market wants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, as a farmer, you will understand that. You cannot just send any product to market&mdash;or you can, but you are not going to get the best price. You get the best price by meeting the demand of the market for a particular type of product. That is what we have to be doing as a nation in terms of exporting, particularly when we talk about exporting high&hyphen;value agricultural products to some of the countries of South&hyphen;East Asia. I will give you an example of the sort of thing I am referring to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About six or seven years ago, as some of my colleagues well know, we exported absolutely nothing by air from far North Queensland. Last season we exported 3,400 tonnes of mangoes by air from Cairns alone. Senator Hogg is doing some quick arithmetic.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is an interesting question, Senator West. We realised about six years ago in far North Queensland that there was an excess freight capacity in the tourist flights that were coming in. So we had frequency of flights as well as low cost of operation. One of the reasons why it is very difficult to succeed in exporting with charter planes is the cost. Let me explain, Senator West, because I know you have an interest in these matters. We are exporting out of North Queensland, out of Cairns, at a cost of 90c to $1 per kilo but generally about 90c in the peak season.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no back load&mdash;and this is the point&mdash;because it is a tourist plane. What happens is: if you use the hold of a 767, it will carry 11 tonnes of freight. The people who come into North Queensland come for about five days, so instead of bringing two suitcases they bring one. There leaves about five tonnes in the hold. If you were to do it by charter flight&mdash;and I know there are people who say, `We want to bring charter planes into wherever'&mdash;you have to understand that the cost will vary between $2 and $3 because there is no cost on the other side. But we succeeded in finding a way to get into the market and we also found a way of ensuring that the product we were producing was the best possible product so that we picked up the premium. We also made sure we were producing at the right time of the year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work of the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation is very significant, and I want to say with a great degree of pride that this government has been instrumental in improving the level of funding. For example, the revenue from government this year is $11.867 million. That is up from $10.292 million last year. That is more than a 14 per cent increase in government grants to the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. As a result of that, the total grants they have given out has increased from $18.801 million to $21.364 million.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because I was adding up the total of the grant money which flowed to our good state of Queensland.

I think it is appropriate that the Senate take note of this report and, hopefully, take the opportunity to debate its contents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an extremely well&hyphen;presented, well&hyphen;researched and well&hyphen;argued report. This report highlights some of the grave concerns that are being expressed across this country in regard to the government's response to the High Court's Wik decision. This report highlights the view that nothing is more important to the shaping of our national character than the way in which our elected representatives respond 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8003"> to the High Court's decision in the Wik case. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Parliament's response to this Bill will provide a measure of the values by which we live and work together as a nation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These are very strong sentiments. This report reflects the very deep concerns and sentiments that are being expressed across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report highlights, as Mr Noel Pearson has indicated, that the Wik peoples put a simple argument to the High Court in June this year&mdash;that is, the rights of pastoralists to their pastoral leases were in no way under challenge and the native title rights of traditional owners could coexist with the pastoralists' rights. They did not challenge the rights of the pastoralists; indeed they urged the court to confirm pastoral rights. The Aboriginal people said that all they were seeking was recognition of coexisting rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is essentially the way in which the pastoral industry in this country has developed throughout its history. What this report does, and I think it is unusual in a government report, is provide a very good historical essay on the way in which the pastoral industry has existed and was founded upon the premise of coexistence. An article by Ms Ann McGrath is included in this report. It draws upon the work of prominent Australian historians and demonstrates conclusively that fundamental premise, that the basis of our pastoral industry in this country has rested upon the foundation stone of coexistence between black and white Australians. That has been the case throughout much of our history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there have been other instances of responses to white settlement, particularly in the north and west of Australia. That is also the situation in my own state. But the fundamental premise has been that, despite the massacres, despite the wars, despite the appalling treatment, the pastoral industry has coexisted with the rights of Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report highlights that the High Court's decision was a confirmation of the rights of pastoralists. There is great irony in the way in which this matter has been debated in the public arena, the way in which this government has sought to stir up racial intolerance, and the way in which this government has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sought not to educate but to inflame and to highlight racial tension in this country. As highlighted in this report:</PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When it comes to the issue of coexistence, the fact remains that there are far greater levels of uncertainty for Aboriginal people than there are for pastoralists. I think that this is a point that is often overlooked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing across this country is that the Aboriginal people's response to this judgment has been, as characterised in the words of the report, `rational, responsible, constructive and firm'. There has been a constant theme in the responses of the willingness of indigenous people to accommodate the legitimate rights and needs of the pastoral industry, government and miners. There has been no rush to lodge claims over pastoral lands. In fact, on the contrary, there have been suggestions by prominent Aboriginal spokespeople in this country that there ought to be a moratorium to allow for a negotiated and reasonable settlement based on real certainty. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot let Senator Carr's comments go without remark. If you listen to Senator Carr, he would have you believe that, and I think he just concluded by saying, there has been no rush to make native title claims in this country. I do not know what the situation is in Victoria, but let me say very clearly that the situation in Queensland is that there has been a massive rush of native title claims. Let me make my position very clear on those native title claims. If an area is genuinely vacant crown land and has not been set aside for a particular purpose, then it is perfectly reasonable to say that, if the Aboriginal people succeed, they should in fact be given 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8004"> title to it. But, better than native title, I believe they should be given freehold title to that land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My point of view from a Queensland perspective is very simple. Queensland has been a state since 1859. If the government of Queensland in almost 140 years has done nothing with a bit of vacant crown land&mdash;has not even set it aside for a purpose&mdash;it is a bit churlish to say that, if Aboriginal or islander people can prove that they have native title to it, they should not be given unfettered access to utilise that land. In fact, that is the point I made to the Central Queensland Land Council earlier this year. They said, `Nobody has ever suggested to us that we should have freehold title to the land. Would you support our having freehold title where we can prove a claim?' I said, `Absolutely. I would support your having freehold title, because I think it is the only way to achieve real economic impoundment of Aboriginal people.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great problems we have is that, in many places, Aborigines are allowed to live on land, particularly in reserves, but they are never allowed to own it. The great tragedy is if you do not have a sense of ownership, you do not have a sense that there is something you can pass on to your children. I believe it is tragic that Aboriginal people may be allowed to occupy land on Aboriginal reserves but in many cases can never own it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we really have in many of these Aboriginal communities is just a perpetuation of medieval feudalism. These Aboriginal people are in no better a position than feudal serfs in the Middle Ages. That is a tragedy. What is also a tragedy is that, under the existing Native Title Act, it is impossible for a private individual to acquire native title rights. For all the noise that we have heard from the other side of the chamber, the one thing which is undeniable is this: in Mabo and Others and the state of Queensland, the High Court created private property rights in favour of those islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It recognised the fact that they had had, prior to white settlement, a system of private property rights over land. When the Native Title Act was introduced, a provision was inserted into that act when it was a bill that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> said that native title cannot be owned by a private individual; it must be owned by a corporation. What the previous government did in its Native Title Act was to destroy the opportunity for Aboriginal and islander people who in fact achieve native title to own it in their own right. It has to be owned by a corporation. It is yet again a perpetuation of this sort of feudal serfdom that holds back the economic aspirations of Aboriginal and islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I well recall the debate in this chamber on that particular night when I argued long and loud that this provision of the bill should be taken out and that Aboriginal and islander people should be allowed to own land themselves if they get native title to it, and they should be allowed to own it as freehold title. That is not possible and the land is effectively alienated. It cannot be transferred. I believe that the Labor government in the Native Title Act did a gross disservice to people who are crown leaseholders in this country and also did a gross disservice to Aboriginal and islander people. That, I believe, is one the great tragedies&mdash;that all of this carry&hyphen;on does not actually advance the interests of either group of people as it sits at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my longstanding view that we should end the paternalism as it applies to Aboriginal people and give them a chance to own the land. But Senator Carr cannot deny the fact that we have seen in the state of Queensland wholesale native title claims over large chunks of Queensland, and that is reprehensible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. It clearly focused on the difficulties that were being experienced by people who were outworkers in our society. These people are almost outcasts and lepers in terms of any industrial rights and industrial justice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The highlight of the report, as far as I am concerned, is a case study which I will come to in a few moments. It is interesting to note that the report identified that most of the outworkers were migrant women and were aged between 25 and 35. The report identified that very few had English language skills and very few were able to find work elsewhere. This really goes to highlight how low on the food chain in respect of dignity these people are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry itself was seeking to address the problems that are being confronted by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> these people. The problems listed in the report include low piece rates, which translate to low hourly rates; impossible deadlines for the completion of work; late payment, underpayment or non&hyphen;payment for completed work; rejection of work; unreimbursed expenses; physical and verbal harassment from intermediaries; blackmail, threats, coercion and bribes; substandard working environments; and worries associated with combining work with family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would hardly think that this was going on in this day and age, but these are the findings of this committee and, from my experience of what goes on out there in the real world, I have no doubt that their findings are, in effect, very much correct. The recommendations that the committee brought down were seeking to redress those problems that are being confronted by those people out there&mdash;people who invariably are isolated and have no&hyphen;one to turn to for assistance. So the report, indeed, was welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of case studies in the report. One sees the case of the Nguyen family, and it describes the conditions under which the Nguyen family had been outworkers. They had been outworkers for seven years. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the last five years they have never received rates equivalent to the award have had to rely on their daughters to assist them with work over the last five years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They say in the report that the average working day was 12 to 14 hours a day seven days a week. This is the problem being confronted by people who have little or no knowledge of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government has set about doing with its industrial relations reform has been to dismantle the system which may in some way protect these people. It is almost incredible to say that this is going on in Australia. It is not going on in some Third World nation. It is not going on overseas somewhere which we have never heard of; it is happening here in Australia. To that extent, it is of real concern. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Nguyens have four children aged between 18 and three years old. The children work at the machines sowing from the age of 13. Before this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8006"> age, they help with ancillary tasks&mdash;turning garments out, folding, sorting, bundling and cutting threads. The children assist for an average of three hours at night and up to 10 hours a day on the weekend. On average, the children work 35 hours per week.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is supposed to be an enlightened society. This report should be made compulsory reading for many people to see the exploitation that went on out there in the marketplace, and still does go on. It is a real indictment on the morality that exists in our society that we let this thing persist, and the response that was offered by the government was feeble to say the least. The only response to the problem of the likes of the Nguyen family came from the agreement that was worked out between a number of retailers and people working in the industry and the ACTU. That particular agreement was there to assist these people who were otherwise badly treated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That, to me, is what this place is really about&mdash;exposing these people, exposing the problems that they are confronted with, exposing those who would exploit them and seeing that those problems are addressed. This place is not about just relying on some mystical power that will take these people out of their problem, out of their difficulties; it is about helping them in a positive and sensible way. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not uncommon for the Nguyens to be given work to be completed within five days but the following day they receive calls from the intermediary to finish the work earlier. They have often been pressured to finish the order in 3&hyphen;4 days and have had to go without sleep for at least one day to complete the order.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If we can stamp out this sort of practice then it is a positive for our society. When you read the ages of the children in the Nguyen family it makes it all the more shameful that we are still resorting to the exploitation of child labour in this nation to provide cheap goods to the retailer, who then puts on an exorbitant mark&hyphen;up. We as unsuspecting consumers go out and pay for these goods, having no idea of the pain, suffering and inconvenience which has been put into those goods by the people who make them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The case of the Nguyen family highlights just how sick our society is if we still treat 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people in this way in this day and age. Whilst I spoke to the government response to this report before actually speaking to the report, I thought that the government response was feeble at best and failed to take up the cudgel to protect the people who are least able to protect themselves. That is what we should be about in this nation. We should not worry about the high&hyphen;fliers and those who are making exorbitant profits and living in the lap of luxury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would commend this report to anyone as it gives a view of what we should not have in our society. I would recommend to people that they be wary of the exploitation of people in our society for the sake of the exorbitant profits which are made by those usuries out there who seek nothing other than to feather their own nests.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ANZUS after 45 years: Seminar proceedings, 11&hyphen;12 August 1997</EMPHASIS> . This was an important seminar because it looked at the ANZUS alliance which is 45 years old. ANZUS is a security treaty and alliance that was signed by Australia, New Zealand and the US on 1 September 1951 and ratified on 29 April 1952. It came out of the relationship that Australia had with the United States in World War II and with New Zealand a long time before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This treaty has been a central pillar of our national security policy for 45 years. Our bilateral relationship with the United States has progressed remarkably well because of it. I think that fundamentally Australia's view of the world has been seen substantially through the close relationship that we have had with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8007"> the United States. I think that is true of governments of all political persuasions during the last 45 years. It is an expectation of the Australian population that we have a strong relationship with the United States even though we may have differences of opinion with them and may seek to open up some of the joint facilities for accountability and management reasons. Certainly our relationship with the United States has been substantially based on that strong ANZUS relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is as important now as ever&mdash;and as the tiger economies in south and east Asia develop and the strategic balance in our region changes and has changed&mdash;that the ANZUS alliance and treaty continues. The biggest structural change to ANZUS was New Zealand's prohibition of nuclear powered ships visiting New Zealand which happened in the mid&hyphen;1980s. The joint standing committee believes that for Australia and the region there remain important advantages in maintaining ANZUS in good repair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the trilateral activities no longer take place because of New Zealand's exclusion by the US&mdash;they view New Zealand's membership as merely suspended&mdash;the US fully understands and welcomes Australia's continuing relationship with our very near and dear neighbour. That is occurring all the time. New Zealand have agreed to buy two Anzac class vessels from Australia and have indicated that they would buy another one. I hope they reconsider a recent decision not to add to the two Anzac class vessels they have agreed to buy. It is important at this time to take stock of the relationship that has served Australia well, has served the region well and will hopefully continue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 2 October, in the adjournment debate in this chamber, I made reference to a book that was about to be launched on the following Monday, 6 October. The book was called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Orphans of the Empire</EMPHASIS> , and it was to be launched by David Hill. Unfortunately, I was not able to be present at the launch, even though I had been invited and, indeed, get a couple of mentions within the book.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing I did forget to make mention of was the author of the book. I seek now to correct that mistake. Now that I have had the opportunity to read parts of the book&mdash;I have not completed it all&mdash;I want to make some remarks on the content of the book itself. Alan Gill is the author of the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Orphans of the Empire</EMPHASIS>. He is a journalist of some 35 years standing, and he was a religious writer for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> for 17 years. In 1985, he was awarded the Walkley award. In 1995, he was made a member of the Order of Australia for services to the media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The book is not for those who wear their emotions on their shirt sleeves. It is a stark reminder of the treatment this country delivered to many young children who were brought here&mdash;some without their parents' 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8008"> consent. Some parents were not even told they had been brought out here. It is a book that can leave somebody with low control over their emotions close to tears, because it is very graphically written. The reason it is so graphically written is that Alan Gill spoke to many of the individuals themselves. The book is not light reading. It is not a book that you would want to take to bed with you and read before you go to sleep. It is very disturbing, recounting what those children went through. In an excerpt on the back of the book, Geraldine Doogue says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Orphans of the Empire</EMPHASIS>  is unusually affecting, hard to put down but very painful to read too, at times. For the extra light it casts upon the Australian&hyphen;Irish Catholic culture that helped form me, with its warts and its well&hyphen;meaning, I am especially grateful.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Geraldine Doogue is obviously well known to everybody in this chamber. I commend Alan Gill for putting down this part of Australian history. I certainly look forward to reading the rest of it. Perhaps at some later time I might come in and recount some of the stories that are in the book.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another book dealing with much the same subject has arrived on my desk in the last week or so. This one is called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the Shadow of the Cross: The Story of VOICES: How the Christian Brothers' Victims Fought for Justice</EMPHASIS>, and the author is Bruce Blyth. On the back cover, Bruce talks about this book being a crusade for truth and justice. To a certain extent, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the Shadow of the Cross</EMPHASIS> is a record of at least a part achievement in that crusade for truth and justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was reminded in glancing through the book&mdash;again, I have not had the opportunity to read each and every part of it because of pressures of parliament and of the committees of parliament&mdash;of some comments that I made in the Senate some four years ago, in 1993, when I said that the possibility of a cover&hyphen;up on allegations of child abuse within the four institutions in Western Australia was reflecting on the Catholic Church as a whole. That was not something I had wished to happen. My former colleague and former senator John Panizza joined with me in the hope that that was not going to happen to the church, but it does appear that perhaps the events in Western Australia and in other places in Australia 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have reflected poorly on the Catholic Church in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An article that appeared on page 5 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 26 September 1997 is headlined `Public bash, abuse Catholic priests'. Part of the article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Catholic priests had been bashed, publicly abused and their homes subject to graffiti attacks in unprecedented displays of hostility, a senior Bishop said yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bishop of Sydney Geoffrey Robinson said the incidents could be linked to public anger directed at priests over child abuse allegations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bishop Robinson is the co&hyphen;chairman of the church's national committee for professional standards which is drafting a code of conduct to counter sex abuse scandals.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is very regrettable that articles such as that appear in our media. Now that a number of things have happened in our community, I hope we will not be seeing reports of priests or anybody else being bashed or abused in public or, indeed, even in private.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a number of developments occur in this record of history&mdash;it is not a particularly proud record of Australian history&mdash;and this book by Bruce Blyth records some of them. Justice is close for some people, but it is not there for each and every one of the victims and probably never will be. But at least now there is public recognition by the church authorities, at least in Western Australia, that some things were not all that they should be. In doing that, they have accepted some of the blame, indeed, are moving towards reconciliation and also paying some small measures of compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bruce Blyth and the membership of VOICES have to be commended and congratulated for their efforts. Their struggle over the years was not easy. It was very difficult, particularly in the early stages, to get acceptance that the allegations that the individuals were making were indeed true. I came into the issue only because certain individuals&mdash;some of whom speak with an accent similar to mine&mdash;approached my office seeking my assistance for them to get their identity back, to get their name back and to get themselves a passport or an identity document in order for them to travel to where they had been brought from&mdash;in some cases it was Northern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8009"> Ireland and in some it was the northern parts of the Republic of Ireland. We were able to assist some of them in getting those documents, but we could not in every case heal the hurt that was deep in their hearts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that justice is getting close for the victims. I commend Bruce Blyth and the membership of VOICES. I also commend the Catholic Church and those in authority within the church for the achievements they have made to date. I do not think the war&mdash;if that descriptive term can be put to it&mdash;is over, but certainly it has gone a long way towards addressing the wrongs that occurred in the past.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8009"><TITLE>Industry Policy</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today Senator Cook moved general business motion No. 826 relating to the government's industry policy. I was, in fact, on the speakers' list and did not get reached before the time for the debate had expired. I was so astounded by some of the claims made during the debate that I wish to take up some of those matters in the adjournment debate tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very terms in which that motion was couched indicate Labor's fundamental confusion as to what actually underpins good industry policy. There has never been any shortage of advice given to governments of either persuasion about what will assist industry. Currently, the government is contemplating the Mortimer report, the Goldsworthy report, the Cutler report and the Metal Trades Industry Association report on the need for proactive investment. Whilst shortly the government will be announcing its response to this plethora of recommendations and encouraging investment and growth in Australian business, there cannot be any reasonable doubt that the most effective industry policy for Australia is, and will remain, fixing the economic fundamentals so that growth can be directed through the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To be able to do this we need to get a fairer and more efficient tax system that allows us to compete internationally; to get a well-designed tax system that delivers a lower rate 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of taxation for all businesses, not just those privileged enough to get a government handout; and to effectively deregulate industrial relations if Labor and the minor parties in this chamber will permit it. Of course a couple of nights ago we saw the extraordinary resolution of this chamber against the exemption of small businesses from unfair dismissal laws&mdash;a job destroying decision if ever there were one. We also need to fix the waterfront, to continue competition policy development, and to identify and remove distortions that protect some sectors at the expense of others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's scorecard on macro-economic reform so far is impressive. I will come back to that if time permits. But the government does recognise that there is a role to play in providing incentives to industry for growth and development. Arguments about incentive schemes tend to downplay the fundamental fact that, under Labor, all too often such incentives were little more than business welfare involving a transfer from Australian taxpayers&mdash;and, in effect, from other efficient businesses&mdash;to those industries that succeeded in a bit of special pleading to government to justify handouts. Not only does this result in sectoral distortions but it is based on dubious and untested assumptions that the trickle&hyphen;down effect actually results in net economic gains for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While there can be no doubt that Australia needs to encourage export competitiveness and exploit our position in the region, the recent destabilisation in the South-East Asian economy must lead us to question the assumption that what works in Asian economies automatically works in Australia&mdash;it does not. Unfortunately, Labor had 13 years to develop a good industry policy and to get the fundamentals right. It failed pretty dismally. Under Labor, the manufacturing sector was forced to shed over 200,000 jobs and showed no net growth in employment for 12 years. So it was more than a little ironic that Senator Cook's motion actually sought to reinstate a job target of 200,000 in the manufacturing sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Business investment declined to its lowest level on record. Australia's average productivity improvement was just 0.9 per cent, half the world's average for this century; foreign 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8010"> debt increased by 800 per cent; real household incomes decreased by nine per cent; a million people were left unemployed; and&mdash;here is the clincher&mdash;Australia slipped from 18th to 24th in terms of business expenditure on research and development among OECD nations. Despite the promises of the Labor government to make Australia the clever country, in 1995 we imported $20 billion worth of technology developed by other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is more alarming for business investment however is that Senator Cook seems unrepentant. He is still intent on picking winners rather than improving the conditions for all businesses to flourish. He was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 17 October this year as misty eyed about the virtues of the now discredited development import finance facility, the DIFF scheme. The headline was: `Another DIFF needed, says Cook.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook is advocating that the company Transfield should again be given a mixed credit taxpayer funded loan to help it win a contract for $178 million to build four patrol boats for the Philippines. It prompted Janet Hunt, the Executive Director of the Australia Council for Overseas Aid, to write to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 22 October. Her letter begins:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Peter Cook's call for a "son of DIFF" to assist Transfield export patrol boats is a worrying sign.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Indeed it is. In case it has escaped Senator Cook's attention, the Simons review of the DIFF scheme recommended against any tied mixed credit scheme and warned against the use of aid to promote trade agendas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example of Labor's backward looking attitude to industry policy was Labor's call for intervention in the recent BHP rationalisation of its steel division in Newcastle. The call for intervention would have simply deferred the hard decisions, long overdue, that BHP needed to take to modernise to make itself internationally competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I doubt that there would be anyone in this chamber who fails to recognise the importance of incentives for a national research development effort and that innovation and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> investment are major factors driving growth and likely to produce new job opportunities. But proposals for R&amp;D incentives posed in the Mortimer report require careful and considered evaluation before they are adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike Labor, this government had the courage to get rid of the inefficiencies of syndication. Even Senator Cook has said the previous syndication system was `an escalating and unsustainable cost to the taxpayer'. So what can he possibly have meant when he called today for a reverse to cuts in industry programs? Does the opposition know whether it is coming or going on industry policy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The R&amp;D start program, which replaces syndication, provides $520 million over four years for genuine R&amp;D. It is better targeted towards larger grants in areas of high&hyphen;risk research and development. R&amp;D funding under the previous government&mdash;where I think Senator Cook held the portfolio, although memories fade quickly&mdash;encouraged a focus on financial returns for wealthy promoters and investors, rather than generating an interest in genuine R&amp;D.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's R&amp;D start program announced the establishment of the Innovation Investment Fund, which will provide $130 million in government funding on a two&hyphen;for&hyphen;one basis giving access to venture capital for small technology based enterprises. It will make available a total of about $200 million for commercialisation of R&amp;D and fills a longstanding gap in the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for access to early stage venture capital was simply ignored by the Labor government. The Innovation Investment Fund is based on successful venture capital models established in the United States and Israel, and will help to ensure a much greater return on R&amp;D expenditure. Australia needs such investment in R&amp;D in order to be competitive and to meet the challenges of the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook's motion then called for a recommitment to a manufacturing jobs target of $200,000. As I said a little earlier, it is a bit rich, as it was the manufacturing sector that was forced to shed over 200,000 jobs and now Labor wants this government to put these jobs back. Of course, now manufacturing is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8011"> globally cost competitive and is growing at twice the rate of all exports, mostly without government assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever response the government does make to the various industry recommendations before it, such initiatives will simply be ineffective unless the artificial impediments to business success are removed. Reform of the tax system, restrictions on industrial relations and removal of those, will have a far greater impact on the success of our economy than any amount of business handouts. This government has got its priorities right.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8011"><TITLE>Parliamentary Privilege</TITLE>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I inform the Senate that a number of legal opinions have been sought recently. I have one from Professor Davis, Professor of Law at ANU, who regularly works for a number of the parliamentary committees. We have the benefit of his view on what transpired before

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the Committee hearing on 12 June 1997, Mr Richter submitted that at least those transcripts were confidential.

That confidentiality was never lifted. His Honour Mr Justice Vincent ruled that it was illegally obtained and excluded the evidence.'</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Professor Davis went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first thing to be said about this submission is that it appears to confuse, on the one hand, the propriety of the way in which the evidence was obtained and its admissibility in criminal proceedings with, on the other hand, the status of the documents as confidential.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The law relating to confidentiality is still in a state of development, but one thing which would appear to be relatively clear is that a claim that a particular document is confidential must be based on some legal principle. Merely to assert confidentiality, without some legal backing for that claim, is not enough. Such a claim may be based, say, on a contract between two parties, or on principles of equity or as an aspect of the property rights which a person has in information, or in a document.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only provision of the Act which appears to be even remotely relevant is section 51, dealing with secrecy. But that section merely prohibits a member of the Authority, or a member of its staff, from revealing information obtained by the Authority, otherwise than in connection with the performance of his or her duties under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This will come as no surprise to anybody in this chamber, but I am not actually an employee of the National Crime Authority. Therefore, I am not bound by the secrecy provisions of the NCA Act. It is quite clear that that is the case. Further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, subsection 51(3) permits, but does not require, a member of the Authority to provide, in Court, information which has been obtained in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8012"> course of an inquiry, where the divulging of that information is "necessary . . . for the purposes of a prosecution instituted as a result of an investigation carried out by the Authority in the performance of its functions" (see paragraph 51(3)(b)).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is absolutely clear. If you collect information, it is allowed to be tendered in court. That is perfectly clear. If NCA staff give material to the courts as part of legal proceedings against individuals, that material is part of the public documents. They are not private, not secret or not illegally obtained, but public documents. Professor Davis went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although some of the documentary evidence tendered by the NCA was found to be inadmissible for a variety of reasons, much of it was accepted without objection by the defence. As the transcript of the committal hearing shows (at p 199), the contents of all of the documentary evidence which Mr Richter now claims is confidential was made available to the press, subject only to the members of the press checking with counsel that any part which they proposed to use was not inadmissible for one reason or another, or was not hearsay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the trial before Justice Vincent, the evidence which the NCA proposed to lead was initially embargoed and not permitted to be released to the media. The reason for that was that anyone who was to be a member of the jury should not be allowed to discover the nature of the evidence to be led, otherwise than in court. But when his Honour ruled that most of the evidence was inadmissible, and the prosecution declined to lead any evidence against the accused, the embargo on release of the material held by the NCA was lifted.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Lifted&mdash;no embargo, no secrecy provisions. It was lifted; they were public documents. Professor Davis went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was hence no judicial ruling that the material be kept confidential, or not released to the public.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">All you have to do to get these transcripts is go down to Justice Vincent's court and request them. It is that simple. Or, if you happen to know somebody who was given a copy during the trial, you can ask them for a copy. That is not illegally obtained. What has been said is an absolute furphy. Further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, as a result of further discussion before the Committee, especially by Mr Walker QC, the Prosecution Case Statement was described by that counsel as "a purely confidential, private document" . . . and therefore one which ought not to be tabled before the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Professor Davis said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With all respect to counsel, I find it</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to make a speech tonight because I had intended to speak about another matter which has not transpired. I want to make a number of observations following Senator Conroy's contribution to the adjournment debate. The first of those is this. With the greatest respect to my friend Professor Davis, in every legal case there are two sets of lawyers; and one set wins and one set loses. What Senator Conroy must understand about legal opinions is that half of the time they tend to be wrong. I am not casting aspersions upon Professor Davis&mdash;he is a very fine man and a very fine academic&mdash;but, just because Senator Conroy can find one lawyer who will write an opinion which supports Senator Conroy's action, it does not mean that Senator Conroy's conduct was legal, nor does it mean that Senator Conroy's conduct was the sort of conduct which should be welcomed in this Senate or in the committees of this parliament. I want to make that comment very clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a place and I understand that there is a role for parliamentarians to use parliamentary privilege to raise matters of significance. I understand that, but there is also a limit. The limit is decency and respect for the freedoms of individuals. What Senator Conroy has done has been to utilise the proceedings of this parliament to conduct a witch&hyphen;hunt, a vendetta, for purely political motives because he sees that as advancing the cause of the Labor Party in Victoria. It is his right to form 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that view, but I ask honourable senators: is that the best purpose to which this parliament can be put? I would say no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many things that this parliament can be used for. There are many things which are appropriate for debate in this place, but I would have thought that if Senator Conroy wanted to use his undoubted talents he could have used them in a much more constructive and creative fashion. Moreover, I am disappointed that Senator Conroy persists in using this to justify his unjustifiable conduct in that Senate committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, I would not conduct myself in that way. I know that most senators would not conduct themselves in that way because they see that conduct as unbefitting a senator. It is for Senator Conroy and his conscience to wrestle with whether he considers this satisfactory, but I will have Senator Conroy know that there are many people in this chamber who were disappointed, not in a political sense, but disappointed in a sense of propriety, with the way in which Senator Conroy conducted himself at that hearing for the simple reason that everybody knew that Senator Conroy was willing to recklessly impugn people, be they guilty or innocent, to obtain a political motive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand why Senator Coonan would compare Senator Conroy's actions with those of Mrs Arena in the New South Wales parliament. If I were forced to make a decision, I would have to say, leaving my party hat off, that I would be forced to align myself with Senator Coonan's comments rather than with Senator Conroy's comments because I can see very little difference between Mrs Arena going out and accusing people of being paedophiles&mdash;she may have seven boxes of documents, she may have four, she may have four folders, she may have absolutely nothing&mdash;and Senator Conroy accusing people in this country of being somehow involved in criminal conspiracies just because it suits him and his political ambitions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this Senate, we begin every day with an invocation that this parliament should serve and prosper the good of the nation. I do not think that Senator Conroy is doing that and that is why I urge Senator Conroy, in the

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The AERTP was one of three initiatives funded in 1990 as part of the Ethnic Radio Current Affairs Service (ERCAS). The other two ERCAS components, involving provision of satellite reception equipment to community broadcasters, and production of a weekly ABC radio series, have been completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funding for the three year ERCAS program totalled $3.4m. From this total, funding of $1.65m was allocated to establish the AERTP in 1992&hyphen;93. The funds were provided to the Community Broadcasting Foundation (CBF) together with an undertaking that the CBF would establish a fund which would allow training in the ethnic community sector to continue over a number of years. On current estimates, the Project will operate on existing funds for the next six years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) In agreeing to the sale of the network, the Government noted that appropriate competitive safeguards would be developed to balance a future purchaser's market power.

<ANSWER PAGE="8032" SPEAKER="Kemp, Sen Rod" NAMEID="WW4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Assistant Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator Kemp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Commissioner of Taxation's primary argument in the Lamesa case was that the "assets" 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of Australian Resources Ltd (ARL) should be held to be the assets held by Arimco Mining Pty Ltd. The latter company held interests in three mines and was controlled by ARL through a 100% shareholding in Australian Resources Mining Pty Ltd which in turn held 100% of the shares in Australian Resources and Mining Company NL with that company holding 100% of the shares in Arimco Mining Pty Ltd. A flow chart setting out the company structure is attached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Article 13 of the Australia/Netherlands Double Tax Agreement (DTA) provides for income from the alienation of real property to be taxed in the State in which the real property is situated. Real property is defined by the Article to be:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) a lease of land or any other direct interest in or over land;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) rights to exploit, or to explore for, natural resources; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) shares or comparable interests in a company, the assets of which consist wholly or principally of direct interests in or over land in one of the States or of rights to exploit, or to explore for, natural resources in one of the States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner's argument was that the income arising from the sale by Lamesa of its shares in ARL fell into category (iii) and should, accordingly, be taxable in Australia where the rights to exploit or to explore were situated. The argument was based on the Court taking a "substance over form" approach which would have recognised that as the DTA provides in sub&hyphen;subparagraph (iii) for real property to be held indirectly through a company that Australia's rights to tax should not be defeated merely because the rights were held indirectly through a chain of wholly owned group companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner's argument was based on the principle that international treaties are to be construed more liberally than domestic law provisions given that they allocate taxing rights between the parties to them rather than impose tax as is the case with the domestic law i.e. the right to tax exists under Australian domestic taxation law and the treaty merely determines whether that taxing right can be exercised by Australia in relation to Netherlands residents deriving income in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner was unsuccessful in this argument before the Full Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The profits on which Lamesa was assessed resulted in a primary tax liability of $74,199,875 this consisted of tax on profits derived in the year ended 30 June 1994 of $28,111,646 and in the year ended 30 June 1996 of $46,088,229.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Commissioner initiated action to assess Lamesa under the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITAA) dealing with capital 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8033"> gains (section 160ZO). These assessments were subsequently amended to assess Lamesa on the profits from the sale of the ARL shares under section 25(1)(b) of the ITAA (i.e. as ordinary income amounts rather than on the capital gain).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Commissioner was not successful because of deficiencies in the current DTA between Australia and the Netherlands..</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The Government is currently considering the options open to it in relation to the decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Yes. However, it should be noted that in the Lamesa case the real property was held indirectly by Australian Resources and Mining Company NL (at that time Arimco NL) prior to the purchase of that company by ARL and its subsidiary Australian Resources Mining Pty Ltd (ARM). Accordingly, based on the Courts finding that Article 13(2)(a)(iii) only applies to real property held by one company tier, interposition of ARL and ARM could not be said to have occurred purely to derive a tax benefit under the Australia/Netherlands DTA as Article 13(2)(a)(iii) would not have applied even if Lamesa had purchased the shares of Arimco NL directly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner will, however, be scrutinising similar structures to that used in the Lamesa case very closely and will not hesitate to use Part IVA of the ITAA in circumstances where the interposition of companies between the real property and a non&hyphen;resident that has control over that real property results from a scheme to defeat the operation of Article 13(2)(a)(iii).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) It is not possible to gauge how many similarly structured transactions may be in existence or the potential revenue loss that might be involved. The effectiveness of similarly structured transactions is subject to the comment on the potential application of Part IVA of the ITAA as referred to in the previous question.</PARA>
<PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) Barristers costs for the ATO are in the vicinity of $140,000, the costs of the Australian Government Solicitor will be approximately $60,000 while costs awarded against the ATO have been advised by the taxpayer's representatives to be around $1.2 million</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) The Commissioner has decided not to seek special leave to appeal to the High Court. The Commissioner's decision is based on the fact that the decision of the Full Federal Court is one open to it on the wording of the DTA albeit the Commissioner would contend not within the spirit of what was intended to be the situation under the DTA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) Three settlement offers were received by the Commissioner through the Commissioner's legal advisers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) As the profit was either assessable or not, the Commissioner did not see any basis for settlement of the case..</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(12) The secrecy provisions of the tax law preclude the Commissioner of Taxation from providing this information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(13) Question is no longer relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(14) The Commissioner took verbal legal advice from Mr David Bloom QC and Mr Tony Pagone prior to the hearing in the Federal Court. Written opinions in relation to appeal applications to the Full Federal Court and also the High Court were obtained from Mr David Bloom QC, Mr Tony Pagone and Mr Tony Payne. The advice was provided on a confidential basis and is covered by legal professional privilege.</PARA>
