<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Monday a report was tabled by Senator O'Chee, on behalf of Senator Watson, regarding the 97th Inter-parliamentary Conference and bilateral visit. It was not incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  and I seek leave to have that happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the report of the Australian Parliament Delegation to the 97th Inter&hyphen;Parliamentary Conference held in Seoul and bilateral visit to Japan from 10 to 21 April 1997. This was a unique experience for me as I had the privilege to visit Seoul 14 years ago as a member of the Australian delegation to the  to the 70th IPU Conference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 97th Inter&hyphen;Parliamentary Conference debated and discussed a range of topics including regional security and peace, sustainable development, the status of the Holy City of Jerusalem and the emergency situation in Albania and Zaire.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All members of the delegation played an active role throughout the entire Conference, participating in all facets of the conference agenda. I would like to take the opportunity to thank all members of the delegation for their companionship and assistance throughout the Conference and Bilateral Visit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having attended the 70th IPU Conference in Seoul, I was particularly interested to see just how far the IPU, as an international body, had come and where it saw its future focus and direction. During my contribution to the General Debate I touched on the need for the IPU to monitor and contain its costs along similar lines introduced by other international organisations. The Australian delegation is of the view that the IPU is at a critical stage in terms of its role as an effective international forum for parliamentary democracy. Many reforms are under way and other reforms are on the agenda. As part of this reform agenda, the Australian delegation felt it necessary to make a number of recommendations and conclusions
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which it believes should be given serious consideration by the IPU Executive and reported on at the next Conference in Cairo in September later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the delegation felt that there is room for improvement with respect to the way in which the agenda is set for each particular Conference. Items placed on the agenda just prior to the Conference cannot be dealt with in an effective and consistent manner when delegates have not been given sufficient time to consider the consequences of particular actions taken at the Conference. It also became apparent to the Australian delegation that the IPU needs to follow up on all the resolutions adopted at each Conference  by way of a report to the Plenary at the next Conference or via a publication. This would ensure that Conferences do not simply turn into a talkfest but there is resolution, action and results.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the stance taken by the Australian delegation at the Seoul Conference, I believe it is vitally important that the Australian delegation sends a very strong and experienced contingent to the Cairo Conference so as to ensure that a number of very important matters that were left unresolved at the Seoul Conference are dealt with adequately and effectively at the 98th Conference in September.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian delegation is in a unique position as it continues to play an active role in both the Asia&hyphen;Pacific and 12 Plus Geo&hyphen;political Groups. Both these groups are instrumental in setting the agendas for future conferences as well as monitoring and reviewing a range of issues germane to the activities of the IPU.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From a personal point of view, I was taken by the changes that have occurred in South Korea since 1983, particularly with respect to the progress in economic and political terms and the standing of the Republic of Korea in the international community. While the progress is noteworthy, many  stumbling blocks still remain on the path towards peace. The greatest remaining challenge is the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members of the delegation took the opportunity while in South Korea to visit the demilitarised zone. While it is very easy for any visitor to be side&hyphen;tracked by the propaganda that is evident through the construction of opposing buildings in the zone, the erection of bigger flagpoles, the parading and positioning of soldiers and the strict adherence to a set of protocols, it does not take long for visitors to be reminded of the very serious side to the DMZ. While tensions between the North and the South remain tense, there is a glimmer of hope in the President Clinton initiative to establish four&hyphen;party peace talks involving the North, the South, China and the US. The delegation wholeheartedly supports this initiative in the hopes that there will be a breakthrough in the negotiations and that a path towards normalisation of relations can be achieved. Tragically, the famine in the North has compounded the conflict to the extent that the North Koreans are unwilling to allow aid to flow freely into the country which would help relieve some of the misery and starvation faced by many millions of its people.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4584"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would now like to make a few observations about the bilateral visit to Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first thing to note is that the relationship between Australian and Japan is not simply one centred around trade The close relationship has manifested itself in many areas including sister&hyphen;city relationships, friendship agreements and a host of other cultural and commercial agreements. These agreements and treaties are also underpinned by a very significant movement of visitors in both directions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian delegation was received at senior levels throughout the visit. Many meetings and discussions with Presiding Officers, Ministers, Parliamentarians and senior business people ensured that the delegation was able to obtain up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date impressions on a range of regional and international issues. As former Prime Minister Nakasone told the delegation, Australia and Japan, form the pivotal North&hyphen;South axis in the all important Asia&hyphen;Pacific Region. It is therefore in both our interests to consolidate existing ties and forge new agreements so that we can maintain a very prominent alliance in what is the fastest growing region in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the time I have available I would like to turn briefly to a few of the issues that we discussed during the bilateral visit to Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of our bilateral relationship, Australia is now seen as a natural partner to Japan in the region in which we share a range of very similar interests. Defence links have entered a new phase with the number of discussions taking place in recent times and this has added a further dimension to the relationship whereby each country has come to rely on the other's support in both regional and international forums in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Japanese economy has emerged from almost no growth in 1993 to around 2 and a half percent in 1995 and is expected to achieve only moderate growth over the next two to three years. However, all other economic indicators would be the envy of any other developed country; low unemployment, low inflation, healthy current account surplus and strong investments. As I said, most countries would be more than satisfied with these fundamentals but Japan knows that it must push on with its program of reform if it is to retain its pre&hyphen;eminent position in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific Region. The only down side to these impressive figures is the chronic public debt problem which stands at around 780 trillion Yen. It is this fact alone that is driving the long overdue administrative and structural reforms. However in most other countries this would be great cause for concern but in Japan this is manageable simply because the banks are prepared to take a longterm view of debt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the trade front, it goes without saying the Japanese market is crucial for many of our agricultural and mineral products. Traditional markets will remain steady for the foreseeable future but there are emerging signs of great potential in many other areas, particularly in the light of the reforms currently underway in Japan and the freeing
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> up of many of the over&hyphen;regulated and highly protected markets. However, to be successful in these markets, an entirely different marketing strategy must be undertaken. Australian firms need to be in touch with end&hyphen;users and  respond to their specific needs and tastes rather than simply develop a product and try to sell it into the Japanese market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are signs that the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation(AMLC) are developing this approach by targeting supermarkets directly to promote consumer awareness of Aussie beef. However, some members of the delegation are concerned about the level and focus of the AMLC's promotion and advertising since its recent change in ownership. This could have a significant impact on our export drive and therefore any reductions should not be based solely on short terms budgetary considerations. While beef tariffs remain high, at around 46% the main obstacle to increased exports of Aussie beef remains one of maintenance of quality and of a standard comparable to the highly expensive local beef.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other successes are emerging in such areas as oysters, mangoes, tomatoes, capsicums, and further market successes are likely to be realised in such areas as apples, housing, furniture, processed foods, housing and construction, transport equipment, telecommunications, health services and sports  medicine. Quality, not volume, will win the day, particularly if the product meets the very high health and safety standards demanded of the Japanese consumer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Japan will remain one of our most important sources of tourists for the foreseeable future. It was pleasing to note that Japanese consumer satisfaction with our tourist facilities as a safe destination remains very high.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have already mentioned, food safety and food quality are key considerations for any successful long term contracts. Recent outbreaks of disease such as e&hyphen;coli, cotton trash and mad cow's disease have impacted not only in the country where the outbreak occurred, but have affected all exporters of similar products. Australia has a strong comparative advantage in agricultural production underpinned by a clean, natural resource base. Australia must continue to promote its position as a leading natural supplier of safe, high quality fresh and processed foods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process of administrative reform and deregulation is underway. While the pace of reform may not be as fast as many commentators would wish, the fact still remains that Australia stands to gain considerably as further reforms in many sectors will enhance  opportunities for many Australian industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to leaving Tokyo for visits to Kyoto and Osaka the delegation made a very  moving and emotional visit to the Yokahama British Commonwealth War Cemetery to lay a wreath and pay its respects to the Australian Service Personnel who lost their lives in World War II. This is the only Commonwealth Cemetery in Japan, and provides a focal point for visitors to reflect on the ultimate sacrifice made by fellow countrymen and to contemplate
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4585"> the prospects of lasting peace and prosperity for people from both sides of the conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, Madam President, I believe the visit provided the delegation with a very good opportunity to explore many aspects of the relationship. While many other new relationships are being forged in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific Region by both Japan and Australia, none of them will diminish in any way, shape or form, the very strong and broad based relationship that has been built up between our two countries over the last 25 years. On the contrary, I believe, this relationship will continue to grow and be a major catalyst in the forging of other strong and lasting ties in the region. The delegation looks forward to further visits between both countries so as to strengthen the very close relationships and continue to pursue matters of mutual interest.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is obviously a matter that is of significance to all senators and members of the House of Representatives. Senators would recall that a proposal for amalgamation of parliamentary departments originally emanated from the discredited National Commission of Audit. After that report had been received by government, the Presiding Officers of both chambers of the Commonwealth parliament sought the views of the heads of parliamentary departments and there was a review of those contributions from Mr Noel Tanzer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A working group was also established from amongst the parliamentary departments, and the two Presiding Officers, I think it is fair to say, Madam President, agreed eventually to a proposal for a two&hyphen;chamber department amalgamation model. This was made available and tabled in the House of Representatives
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and in the Senate with the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Managing the parliament&mdash;the way ahead</EMPHASIS>. As is required in the standing orders of the Senate, this particular matter was required to be dealt with by the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appropriations and staffing committee conducted public inquiries and has spent a good deal of time examining the benefits and the disbenefits of the amalgamation proposal. I think it is fair to say that we were underwhelmed by the level of support for this proposal not only from within Parliament House and within the parliamentary departments but also more broadly from the community. I can recall only one vaguely suppor tive written submission that came to our committee and very little positive supporting evidence during the public hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the opposition is concerned&mdash;and in our own internal processes&mdash;this is not something about which we have come to a firm parliamentary party or caucus view. It is something that the members of the Appropriations and Staffing committee of the Senate and interested senators on the one hand and many of our colleagues in the House of Representatives on the other hand have had a close look at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a range of views in the Labor opposition about possible approaches on this issue. What we have to say very clearly is that we do not come to the issue of amalgamation of the parliamentary departments from an oppositionist perspective. I am certainly not willing to rule out proposals for the amalgamation of the parliamentary departments per se. But what I would say is that the model that we have examined&mdash;the model that was subject to debate by the Appropriations and Staffing Committee and the model that has been presented in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Managing the parliament&mdash;the way ahead&mdash;</EMPHASIS>is not one that I can embrace. It is a model that has received virtually no support from within Parliament House or beyond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On page 6 of the report the committee reports on the estimated savings from this two&hyphen;chamber proposal. The report says:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4586">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It estimated that longer&hyphen;term savings from the elimination of duplication would be in the order of 40 to 50 staff, being 25% to 30% of the corporate services staff, which would generate savings in salaries of $2 million to $2.5 million. The Working Group suggested that these savings were not insignificant, but that further improvement of services to senators and members would be contingent upon efficiencies being realised in both the joint and separate operational areas of the amalgamated departments.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I really think that the parliament has to focus on the issue of whether the sort of upheaval that is envisaged in the one proposal&mdash;the two&hyphen;chamber department amalgamation proposal that is before the parliament&mdash;is warranted for this level of savings. The conclusion that I have come to and the committee has come to is simply that it is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The management model for the two&hyphen;department structure is very worrying. Effectively, it is a board comprising such eminent people as yourself, Madam President, the Clerk of the Senate, the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Speaker. I have always been concerned about how that board might work. There is always an opportunity in a four&hyphen;member board, as you know, Madam President, for the board to effectively split down the middle. You then have a situation where there are divisions between the Senate and the House of Representatives and yourself and the Senate Clerk lining up against the Speaker and the Clerk of the House or, alternatively, we could have a situation where the clerks line up against the presiding officers. I really think this model is just a recipe for inaction or non-action&mdash;a recipe for disaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that one of the problems with what we have before us is really the limited terms of reference that the Appropriations and Staffing Committee had. In other words, I do not think the model we had was a good model at all. Many of the witnesses that we had before us and many of the submissions that were before the committee were really able to effectively shoot holes in this. I think those who are genuinely concerned about proper administrative practice and management practice would have to be concerned about the nature of the proposal that was contained in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Managing the parliament&mdash;the way ahead</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is disappointing that the Appropriations and Staffing Committee's deliberations were limited to one inadequate model. The committee has recommended that the Senate not agree to the proposed amalgamation in that form. It has also asked the presiding officers to require parliamentary departments to identify where savings might be achieved and that the funding of new policy proposals from savings made by those departments actually be the subject of agreement between presiding officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been creative in suggesting that new policy proposals for the parliamentary departments be in the form of a joint submission from the presiding officers to the govern ment. I think that is a positive step forward. I hope that the government accepts these recommendations in the spirit in which they are intended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the small savings that can be achieved here, we will end up with great disruption and very little benefit from this proposal. If the amalgamation of parliamentary departments is to be further considered, let us hope that we have other proposals before us because I do not think anyone will write off the possibility of amalgamation of parliamentary departments. This proposal, as far as the committee is concerned and as far as I am concerned, is not the way ahead.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry if I am interposing between a couple of other speakers, but I have another commitment very shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say at the outset that I am an unreconstructed amalgamationist. I have had the view for about 10 years that I thought four or five parliamentary departments on the scale of things was a ridiculous concept. I am always massively disappointed when I go into a committee hearing with those fixed views and have my prejudices overturned by compelling evidence. I have to admit that on this occasion that is simply what has happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We looked at a proposal for amalgamation of the parliamentary departments which had
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4587"> its genesis in the National Commission of Audit's report. The more we looked at it, the more we realised that the commission of audit had only scanned this particular issue and come to conclusions without any evidence or long-term thought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing that came up was that the way forward, the way ahead, was done genuinely and with good intentions by the group that put it together. But it is not an in&hyphen;depth document, and virtually every submission our committee received opposed amalgamation. So I had to think about this compelling evidence and, I must say, it convinced me on this occasion that this model is not the way ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should put on the record that this parliament, in the last four or five years, has contributed something like a 14 per cent savings regime back to the budget&mdash;the $10 million cut plus the efficiency dividends have meant something like a 14 per cent cut to the money available to the parliamentary departments. When you measure that against all other departments, it is not a bad effort. I would especially draw your attention to the savings that have been generated in these parliamentary departments with that of Treasury. Treasury does not cough up too much money. When resources need to be transferred to it, they always go at 100 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also draw your attention to not a particularly brilliant line of questioning I did at estimates with the Department of Finance, which is outsourcing everything. When I put it to that department, `You have out sourced everything, why don't you merge with Treasury?' there was absolute shock and horror, `Oh, no, we could not do that, Senator, that is not on.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So just arguing that amalgamation or big is better must be sustained by the facts. I know how much this report is going to be demonised by the Department of Finance and by some people in the House of Representatives. By refusing the amalgamation of parliamentary departments, we are going to be called recalcitrants&mdash;people looking after only our own self-interests, people who are not
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concerned with reform. But that is a most unfair characterisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposition is that if you amalgamate all the corporate services and go to a two departmental structure you will generate savings. But the savings are not calculated. The guesstimate is, at the very top, that you will save $2.5 million. But you will not save that in the next outyear or the outyear afterwards. Probably in three to four years time you will reach the $2 million to $2&half; million savings. In the meantime, there will be much more money going out because of redundancies&mdash;and it takes a while to recover that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government is saying is that for a one to 1&half; per cent saving to the parliamentary budget it is going to turn this place over&mdash;it is going to start turf warfare amongst the people to see who will survive the musical chairs; it will have redundancies. This will take place against an atmosphere where, at the  same time, we will be putting in workplace agreements, service level agreements and where there will be a divorce of all the employees in this building from the Public Service Act, which is proposed by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there will be a very destabilised period over the next three to four years for what really constitutes minor savings. None of us scoff at savings. None of us is so arrogant to say, `Even an extra million dollars worth of savings is not worth while.' But the fact is that there are alternative savings methods that will cause far less disruption than the amalgamation proposal. It has been pointed out in evidence that things such as joint procurement and the joint use of a variety of different facilities around the building in specialised areas will generate savings which can be used to offset other costs around the building.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it does not matter whether you amalgamate the parliamentary departments and make savings or not, this  building is going to run at a deficit for the next decade. We have an intrinsic problem here that there is no provision for proper asset replacement. In other words, the total global budget of this building can be moved around to make up various deficits as they occur. But there are not
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4588"> sufficient prospective savings, either by the method this committee recommends or by way of parliamentary amalgamations, that will fund the asset replacement to keep this building going. The security equipment, the phone system and the sound and vision system all require more money than any of the potential savings options available will provide.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if we got to that stage and said, `Amalgamation is a possibility just on the basis of economic efficiency,' we then have to take the next step and say, `How does the place run on a two department structure?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal to set up a board of four to run the place is wrong in principle. I do not believe that the presiding officers should have to share their power responsibilities with non-elected clerks of the building. I do not think the clerks in this building would particularly aspire to that role either&mdash;they are the appointed employees, equivalent, I suppose, to a department secretary, to do administrative tasks and not to rule or make decisions on policy matters. As Senator Faulkner said, all sorts of divisions could appear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know at the moment that the President and the Speaker have a very harmonious relationship. For most times in the past that has been true, but not all times. If we set up this sort of structure in the future and we suddenly get personality clashes between the Speaker and the President, how would this structure work? For the first time ever we would have people from the Department of the House of Representative&mdash;staff, the Speaker&mdash;determining the resources for the Senate, and vice versa. That could cause a lot of pain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the actual division of the two other departments into the House of Representatives and the Senate, the Senate would inherit all the sick children. The Senate would inherit all those particular groups that would require a lot of money in future. There is no particular goodwill from that point of view. We might think, at first view, that the request is not bad, but in the end I think you will find it is a fairly poor deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report does recommend some changes. It goes to the issue of having the four parliamentary departments put in a joint submission
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the ERC. That will have the benefit of looking at the total expenditure of all four departments&mdash;or five if you insist that, but it is really four&mdash;and being able to shift money between one or the other, which happened this financial year. The Joint House Department was able to move money across to the Senate and House of Representatives to fill in the shortfall. Some time in the future it may be the other way round&mdash;some money from the Senate or House of Representatives departments may move across to the Joint House Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again say that I think this report has great potential to be demonised and misunderstood. It is one of those genuine reports where a lot of people went in with pre&hyphen;existing prejudices and came out the other end with a different view. That view was based on the facts and the knowledge of the way this building works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say in conclusion that this cannot have been an easy report for you, Madam Presi dent, to have presided over, because of the dual roles that you play. I should put on the record that you adopted the very appropriate method of not having a chairman's draft but of having a draft by the secretary of the committee come to the whole committee. I think that was a most appropriate administrative way of handling it. I hope that in future people from executive government are not critical of you over this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fair to say that it was virtually the unanimous view of the committee, with some degrees of enthusiasm or otherwise, to come to these conclusions. I repeat: this report is not a case of senators going away and looking after their self-interest; it basically says that, the amount of savings involved here being very minor, it is not worth turning this place over just for the sake of change.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find myself in the interesting position of agreeing with every single word that Senator Ray has said, pretty well everything that Senator Faulkner has said and almost everything that Senator Ian Macdonald has said about the proposal in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Managing the parliament&mdash;the way ahead</EMPHASIS> . This is a position that I almost never find myself in. It is a bit of a worry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was on the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing as well. I must say that I came out of the hearings, having read all the submissions, with the impression that this was something that had a life of its own. I believe the first suggestion of amalgamation of parliamentary departments was in 1906, or 1908, and there have been suggestions ever since then. This latest one came from the Commission of Audit, which asserted that savings could be made&mdash;substantial savings, I suppose&mdash;if the five departments were amalgamated into one. But there was no evidence for that and certainly no proof. This assertion was made without talking to any of the parliamentary departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The suggestion went on to another life when Mr Tanzer had a look at it, and then another life when the working group had a look at it. The working group asserted that $2 million to $2&half; million savings could come from total disruption of the entire parliament and the five departments. They did not work out how much would have to be spent, as Senator Ray has said, in redundancy payments
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and in other payments. We could not see that you would get anywhere even near the $2 million when you took out all the expenditure and the disruption. It just did not seem to be worth the money that we would save from doing all this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth pointing out again that more than $14 million has already been saved in the parliamentary departments and that there are other places where money can be saved. Joint warehousing, joint travel, procurement of basic stationery and other things were mentioned to us. I think these are well worth looking at&mdash;in fact, I know that they will be looked at. I think that we actually could find more savings there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth pointing out what Senator Ray said: there are a lot of assets that are going to need to be replaced. This building will be 10 years old next year, and there are many assets which will urgently need replacement. I know the telephone system is one of  them&mdash;and it is not the only one. That is going to cost a lot of money. It will be new money expenditure for asset replacement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we can get both Presiding Officers&mdash;this is another of the recommendations&mdash;putting in a joint recommendation for that extra expenditure, then I hope we will be able to do that. The parliament needs it, and Parliament House certainly needs it. I certainly give my agreement to all the recommendations in this report. They were unanimous. I hope that all other senators will look at it as favourably.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the fifth speaker in this debate, I stand as the mover of the motion which asked the Senate to look into the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Managing the parliament&mdash;the way ahead</EMPHASIS> . I am extremely grateful that the Senate, by a small majority, I have to say, agreed to look into this at the end of last session.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was extremely important that there be a process by which the proposal was not only reviewed but reviewed in a way that enabled people to give submissions freely and openly on a very important issue under the protection of parliamentary privilege. The reason it is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4590"> important, as has been alluded to by other speakers, is that it is not just about meeting the needs of parliamentarians; what this process is doing is enabling parliamentarians to work in a way that is appropriate to the needs of democracy. Democracy, in many ways, is a very fragile thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ability to gain independent and professional advice is extremely important in a democracy. The ability to ensure the independence of advice and that each chamber of the parliament is not controlled by the other is extremely important and should never be underestimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ability to operate departments without necessarily being forced to have operatives, for instance, departments, coming in on secondment is extremely important in the separation of powers. This could well happen if you have one chamber in charge of another chamber's outcome. The independence of the Parliamentary Library should never be underestimated. It has certainly been indicated that the savings may be illusory, if anything. It has never been my opinion that, if you have several bureaucracies and you amalgamate them, you are necessarily going to get a more efficient bureaucracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless it is conceded that one part of the bureaucracy is non&hyphen;functional or not necessary, the larger the bureaucracy, in my opinion, the less functional it becomes, the less able it is to meet the needs. It seems to me that outcomes sometimes get forgotten when we look for so-called efficiencies, which generally translate to job cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A great deal of change has occurred over the last 18 months and the changes often occurred at the expense of jobs. So far, $14 million worth of savings have been achieved in the last 18 months by a great many changes. If there are ways of using existing resources to achieve the same or better outcomes and to use those resources more effectively, the primary motive of change should be just that. It should not be change for the sake of change, and certainly not change that may well mean that our precious and fragile democracy within the parliamentary system is threatened.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that there are already differences between the way the House of Representatives and the Senate operates. We know that is because, as has always been the case, there is a majority within the government and the government gets its way. We know that the government ministers can direct committees as to what inquiries they take. We know that, in effect, it is possible for ministers to veto certain inquiries taking place. We know that departmental operatives can be seconded to committees and those departmental operatives are under the control, effectively, of the minister. We know that we do have a chance within the Senate to try to maintain that very precious separation of powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is often forgotten within this place that within our constitution, within our tradition, `separation of powers' means that the executive, the parliament and the judiciary should be separate. This is not always the case, or it is not always clear within the House of Representatives, but it is extremely important  that the threats are recognised and, once recognised, are guarded against.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I believe it was very important to gain the opinions of a range of people and to put this report together. I would like to say that I commend those people responsible for this report for putting it together. I certainly hope that the government takes this fully into consideration before considering any amalgamation which may threaten our precious democracy.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this inquiry was to review the arrangements which apply when people wish to protest at Parliament House and other areas of national land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That includes The Lodge, the Australian War Memorial, Canberra Airport, the embassy area, Commonwealth offices and defence facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would seem the title of the report, `A Right To Protest' begs a united chorus of "yes of course we have a right to protest."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That's because in Australia we have forever expected to have the right to protest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So strong is our democratic tradition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But in fact, as the Committee inquiry reveals, we cannot and should not take this right for granted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So fragile is that right, so easily can it be lost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It can be lost for example by only a few stirrers taking over a demonstration and causing property damage or provoking the authorities into a reaction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is when a protest becomes a riot.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore perhaps the most important finding of the inquiry was society must not take for granted the right to protest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just as the price of freedom is `eternal vigilance', the same can be said about the right to protest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After all that is the ultimate freedom.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Look at the ends of the scale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At one end we have the Tiananmen Square experience, where the glimpse of a right to protest was squashed under a tank.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the other end of the scale is Australia, a vigorous democracy which unequivocally allows our people the right to protest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Though at times the bounds of our tolerance have been sorely tested.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I give the example relating to the demonstration last August which degenerated into the storming of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That riot led to smashed doors, a plundered gift shop and, worse, a cowardly and vicious attack upon a police woman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But what is little known about that day is the great tolerance shown by authorities in the heat of the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the basement awaiting the order to defend Parliament House was a tactical response force in full gear (shields &amp; batons).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even in the worst moments of the riot their commanding officer did not deploy them against the demonstrators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They were only used to defend the building.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason was a good one because the possibilities of the riot turning even uglier would have been real.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet think of what the response of some other countries may have been to an equivalent danger.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see them on the nightly news. . . ..</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Countries so used to demonstrations turning ugly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be no exaggeration to say, with a click of the fingers they would send in the riot police with shields and batons, water hoses, and even tear gas, if their Parliament was so threatened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I venture to say its only because Australia has built a culture of a right to protest that the extreme was not used to retaliate against the mob out of control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This culture is what we seek to preserve in our report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Committee chose not to over&hyphen;react.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have adopted a minimalist approach to ensure that the right to protest is not diminished here in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While some people proposed a more structured approach to dealing with public demonstrations, through permits or a formal notification system, the Committee considers that such options would be overly complex and unnecessarily restrictive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instead, we have put our faith in the Australian people that they will exercise their right to protest in an orderly and peaceful manner and will shun the violence we witnessed last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The clear message we received from many contributors to the inquiry was that Australians do not want or need
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4592"> a system which unnecessarily increases the controls or limits on their right to protest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee agrees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our recommendations focus on encouraging cooperation between protesters and relevant authorities to ensure the proper planning and conduct of public demonstrations at Parliament House and on other parts of national land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, in adopting this minimalist approach, the Committee agreed that there is a need to tidy up some of the rules which apply to protest structures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the inquiry, we heard about many problems which have arisen when people have sought to erect structures in support of their protest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The structures have included tents, sheds and even a Trojan Horse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to recognise that there already is a requirement for people to seek approval before they can erect a structure on national land, but the law is unclear and open to testing in the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As acknowledged by the Committee, unclear law does not make for good law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To make it fair for all, and to ensure public safety, the Committee has recommended the introduction of a permit system for protest structures on national land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not an attempt to restrict protesters who want to use structures as part of their protest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The system we have proposed clarifies and simplifies the process by which protest structures can be authorised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other Committee recommendations include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">identifying a contact officer in the Australian Federal Police to coordinate protests on national land and to liaise with protesters and other relevant authorities on the arrangements for protests;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">producing a public information booklet with advice about protesting on national land;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">repealing outdated and unnecessary legislation limiting protests; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">revising existing laws applying to protests to ensure that they are written in plain English and outline clearly the powers available to relevant authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I finish by saying that while what we may classify as bad demonstrations are few and far between, it is through these bad experiences that the absolute and cherished right to protest may well be etched away.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So it is incumbent on all demonstrators to keep this in mind when taking up the banner and marching.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is very grateful for the work and support provided by its secretariat.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to present this unanimous report of the Committee into the optimal role and function of the Administrative Review Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ARC's main role is to provide advice to government on administrative decision&hyphen;making and review. It does this by letters of advice, reports based on research projects, comments on Cabinet submissions, and providing departments and agencies with advice on the administrative review aspects of initiatives they are undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee found that it is difficult to identify objective criteria against which to assess the effectiveness of the Administrative Review Council. Nonetheless, the evidence received by the Committee supports the view that the Administrative Review Council has been an effective body, providing useful and timely advice on administrative review matters. The Committee did, however, receive some suggestions that the ARC could give greater attention to identifying the costs entailed in adopting its advice and recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As our report notes, with one exception all the submissions we received basically supported retaining the ARC in something like its present role and shape. The one exception was a submission from Mr Anthony Morris QC, which argued that the ARC had largely fulfilled the functions for which it was established over 20 years ago, and that it should now be abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report recommends that the ARC should remain as a separate and permanent body, provided that it is making a significant contribution towards an affordable and cost&hyphen;effective system of administrative decision&hyphen;making and review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remainder of the eleven recommendations in the report relate to matters of detail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several concern the membership structure of the ARC. For example, the report recommends that in selecting
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4593"> persons for appointment, the Government should continue to have regard to the need for the ARC membership to contain a broad spectrum of qualifications and to represent a variety of interests. It also recommends that the qualifications required for membership of the ARC be broadened to enable the appointment of persons with direct knowledge and experience of the needs of groups or individuals significantly affected by government decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report further recommends that the legislation be amended to enable persons to be appointed as Council members for the purpose of a particular project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Committee does not endorse the suggestions it received that the Act should be amended to require the appointment of a person having any specific qualification or representing any specific interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other recommendations relate to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">clarifying the definition of the ARC's functions in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">setting out the power of the Attorney&hyphen;General to issue directions and refer matters to the ARC; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">formalising in the legislation the present informal practices under which the ARC's project reports are provided to the Attorney&hyphen;General, are tabled in the Parliament, and are responded to by government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, I would like to conclude by making some personal comments about the appropriateness of inquiries similar to the one that is the subject of this report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time the inquiry was instituted, the ARC had been in existence for twenty years and had not previously been subject to any review. The request for the Committee's inquiry came from the Attorney, who was quite properly concerned to have the ARC's continuing relevance and effectiveness examined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, with the benefit of hindsight I believe that assessment of the optimal role and effectiveness of bodies like the ARC is probably better done by management consultants. The ARC has not been the subject of controversy or widespread criticism in the community. As a result, our inquiry did not benefit from receiving the broad range of competing views and arguments I believe is essential to provide the foundation for well&hyphen;grounded and well&hyphen;considered committee reports. In the absence of the sort of controversy that ensures a committee receives a range of competing views, the investigatory techniques available to management consultants are better suited to evaluating bodies like the ARC than the process of submissions and public hearings that committees use.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS COMMISSION SALE BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">General</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian National's (AN) operations, in common with many other Government owned railways, are characterised by a large and increasing debt and a declining market share. The performance of rail stands in stark contrast to the road transport sector which has been very successful in addressing customer needs and therefore increasing its market share.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To a large extent this situation reflects the fundamental problems arising from Government owning and operating businesses that are more efficiently conducted by the private sector. In particular, Government rail authorities have in many cases over the years, largely operated as monopolies, have often been subject to political interference and have not been placed on a fully commercial footing. Under these circumstances, pricing, operating and investment practices tend to be unresponsive and inflexible. If real reform is to be achieved in the rail sector it is vitally important that the inherent deficiencies associat
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ed with Government ownership be replaced by a dynamic market driven approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problems confronting AN, however, have been substantially magnified by the establishment of the National Rail Corporation (NR). In particular, AN has been left with very large debts while the large bulk of its profitable operations have been transferred to NR. Furthermore, AN has been required to provide NR with significant services at well below cost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government became aware of the extent of AN's problems shortly after taking office. I commissioned the independent Brew review, which  revealed a situation requiring urgent remedy. Increasing debt, a loss of business, and escalating taxpayer subsidies were aspects of AN which the former Government both ignored and failed to address.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to make it clear that the financial mess at AN was not the result of AN staff or management, but the result of decisions made by the former Government which left AN in an impossible position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, I announced on 24 November last year a $2 billion reform package to rejuvenate the rail sector. The reforms will impact through the separation of the management of the interstate rail track network from above track operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major benefit of structural separation lies in replacing the incentives for anticompetitive and uncommercial behaviour with an incentive to maximise the number of operators on the network. The Commonwealth's role will concentrate on controlling and managing economically-efficient and non-discriminatory access to the interstate rail network. This will allow the interstate rail network to operate largely as the roads do now: Government-owned, but open, upon payment of an access fee, to anyone licensed to operate a vehicle over the network. Such a change can only be of benefit to the users of rail transport and indeed to the economy as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is the first legislative step in achieving this important component of microeconomic reform. The injection of private sector expertise into rail operations will reduce costs, improve service responsiveness and increase rail market share.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Proposed Bill</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian National Railways Commission Sale Bill 1997 gives effect to the Government's decision to sell the non-interstate mainline track rail assets of Australian National (AN) in whole or in part. It provides a flexible framework to facilitate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> authority and mechanisms for the sale, including authority to repeal, replace or amend rail agreements with South Australia and Tasmania following their agreement to sale arrangements; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reduction of AN to an entity charged with dealing with any residual functions and the balance of assets and liabilities not included above, or not able to be
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4595"> disposed of in the short term, and resolving outstanding litigation and disputes prior to abolition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A viable rail industry</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AN has been offered for sale as a single unit or by component parts such as interstate passenger operations, vertically-integrated rail freight operations in South Australia and Tasmania or railway workshops.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AN's rail operations have been restricted in their operation by corporate overheads and the burden of debt. Recognising that this arrangement is not sustainable, the Government has decided to offer AN for sale free of debts and liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed that companies be established under the Corporation Law to be the vehicles through which the sales occur. The assets of AN necessary for the operation of each component of the AN business will be transferred into a company by Ministerial direction listing the assets, or classes of assets. The shares in the company will be sold to a new rail operator. The liabilities of AN would be retained and paid out by AN or transferred to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus the Bill proposes flexible arrangements for the transfer of assets, liabilities and contracts between AN, the Commonwealth and a new rail operator.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To provide maximum flexibility to a purchaser, it is not proposed that any staff transfer to private sector purchasers. Instead it is proposed that staff be made redundant on sale or closure of the part of AN in which they work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be no requirements or arrangements in the sales process for the transfer or re-employment of employees and general industrial relations legislation will determine award provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new operator will not be burdened by existing liabilities or inappropriate staffing structures and can develop arrangements consistent with a viable transport company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Incentives to improve infrastructure</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States have interests in a large proportion of AN-owned land under the 1975 agreements which transferred railway assets to the Commonwealth. It is proposed that the land revert to the States for them to lease to a new rail operator.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that the sale arrangement create an incentive for an injection of funds to improve and maintain the rail infrastructure. Ownership of infrastructure is considered a key part of providing this incentive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To achieve an infrastructure ownership arrangement under land lease, the Bill proposes that railway land fixtures such as track, signalling equipment, culverts, buildings etc be severed from the land by the sales legislation for sale to the new operator with above track assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreements with the States</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has legislated a range of agreements with the States over the years. Some of these need to be
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amended or repealed to allow the sale to proceed. The Government is negotiating  with South Australia and Tasmania on these issues and is confident of reaching agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The shares in each new company established to operate a business previously within AN will become part of a sales agreement between the Commonwealth and a private sector purchaser. The Bill proposes that the Minister for Finance be authorised to sign an agreement with the purchasers of these new companies..</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is envisaged that these sales agreements will be a key mechanism by which Commonwealth commitments under the agreements with the States will be honoured. Sales negotiations with prospective purchasers cannot be finalised until the Parliament agrees to the sale and new agreements have been reached with South Australia and Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill thus proposes that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I be empowered to enter into new agreements with the States;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> those agreements be given legislative force through regulation able to be disallowed by either house of Parliament;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the various Acts authorising current agreements with the States be repealed on the day on which new agreements take effect; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> any agreement executed in this way be approved and its performance and observance by the Commonwealth be authorised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AN financial obligations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes a range of provisions which are intended to both protect the Commonwealth from default by AN as a result of the loss of assets and revenue generating capacity and provide for the Commonwealth to take over and meet obligations of the Commission in order to protect companies which have contracted to AN in good faith.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These proposed provisions include the expansion of Commonwealth guarantee powers and provisions to enable the Commonwealth to discharge AN obligations from funds appropriated for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AN is established and operated under the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983. The Bill proposes a range of amendments to the Act to enable the Commission to assist the Commonwealth in implementing its rail reform objectives in relation to the Commission. It also provides a power of direction which enables the Minister for Finance to direct AN in the disposal of its assets and liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through the sale process, AN will shed all its rail operations other than the ownership and management of interstate track. The Bill proposes transitional arrangements, including allowing flexibility to reduce the structure and size of the Commission as the business
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4596"> contracts and providing the means to transfer residual assets, liabilities and contracts to the Commonwealth and abolish the Commission when it has wound down sufficiently..</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also proposes the amendment of a range of existing legislation to facilitate the sale and in consequence of the abolition of AN.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The future of rail in Australia lies with using our current system much more efficiently and effectively, through encouraging the participation of the private sector, introducing competition and providing a greater customer focus.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is possible for the rail industry to operate profitably, and this will require substantial programs of cost reduction and capital investment by the private sector, accompanied by improvements in service quality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is these initiatives that will give us a viable long-term rail industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation underpins the Government's rail reform package and is essential to its implementation. The reform package has a number of elements but, in particular, seeks to revitalise rail transport by separating the provision of access to essential infrastructure (the interstate track) from the provision of rail transport services, which is more appropriately the role of the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Passage of the legislation is crucial to the attainment of the Government's timetable for the sale as it will enable the Government to sell AN assets and services, clearly signalling the Government's commitment to reform. It will also directly increase participation of the private sector in the rail industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AN is losing money and is in an unsustainable and declining financial position which is unlikely to be improved in the current environment of uncertainty. The extensive restructure required to generate an efficient and profitable rail system is best able to be achieved through government divestment and the injection of private sector transport expertise. This is also the best long-term guarantee of employment in the rail industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prompt passage of the Bill will mean that elements of AN can rapidly be divested and will thereby reduce uncertainty for AN, its staff, other participants in the rail industry and the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Delays in sale will unnecessarily increase taxpayer liabilities and adversely effect the Government's budget strategy.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">WOOL INTERNATIONAL AMENDMENT BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, this bill represents the culmination of a process aimed at providing the Australian wool industry with a clear direction for the future. It is the final stage in preparing the industry to stand on its own feet, unencumbered by unnecessary government regulation and direction. It heralds the end of an era in Australian wool,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an era that has been marked by significant debate and controversy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year, this Parliament passed a bill providing for the final stage in the disposal of the wool stockpile which was created during the last years of the reserve price scheme. The bill I now present establishes the wind-up procedures for Wool International, through liquidation, and the distribution of equity to wool tax payers in Wool International.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Above all, Madam President, this bill represents the success of the consultation process established in the early months of the life of this government which has had the ultimate aim of developing, with industry, a clear future direction for Australian wool, including finalisation of the sale of the wool stockpile, retirement of the associated debt and deregulation of the industry. Further more, the government will provide for the distribution to wool tax payers of equity in Wool International, providing wool growers with much needed, and deserved, entitlements to profits from the sale of the wool stockpile and associated assets. The granting of entitlements to wool tax payers will also provide a more secure basis for those wool growers in most need to either sell, or borrow against, their entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, a further, related, development in the wool industry has been the emergence of the proposed wool marketing joint venture, `Global Wool'. This proposal will only be developed, on a commercial basis, with the concurrence of the australian competition and consumer commission and the government. I emphasise that the government has no direct role to play in `Global Wool'. If the venture proceeds, Wool International's only proposed involvement would be by way of establishing the vehicle for wool grower investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides a package of measures which will see wool growers given entitlements in Wool International; the development of a loan facility which will allow growers to better use their entitlements as security for loans; provide for the liquidation of Wool International; enable interim and final payments of Wool International assets to wool-tax payers; and offer a mechanism to allow growers to invest their equity return in a growers' investment trust, which might participate in the proposed `Global Wool' wool marketing joint venture. It will also introduce the corresponding changes to the objects and functions of Wool International and reduce the size of the Wool International board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the first and most fundamental of the amendments is that of giving wool tax payers entitlements in Wool International. When Wool International was established in 1993, it was intended to corporatise and then privatise the organisation by 1 July 1997. Although the act never provided for this to occur, this government has made a commitment to provide growers who paid the debt component of the wool tax from 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1996 (including voluntary contributions) with an entitlement to equity in Wool International.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4597"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All wool tax paid up to 30 June 1996, including voluntary contributions, is to be converted to units. Wool tax payers are to be issued a statement of unit holding on the basis of a unit for every dollar of wool tax paid. Depending on the net assets of Wool International, each unit would then have an implied value which can be used as a basis for trading units.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will give wool growers not only a right to the equity of Wool International, which has been an intention of the act since 1993, but will provide growers with the ability to trade their units. Similarly, wool tax payers will be able to offer their entitlements in Wool International as additional security when taking out a loan with a financial institution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wool International will maintain the wool tax register to record changes in ownership in future equity and, in the case of a loan over the units, the register will record the financial institution's interest in the units.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, Wool International will issue wool tax payers with a consolidated wool tax record in early June this year. Wool tax payers will be required to respond as to the completeness and correctness of this wool tax record by 1 August this year. I cannot overemphasise to wool tax payers the importance of a prompt response to ensure they gain their correct entitlement to Wool International equity. When finalised, this register will be the basis for entitlements and equity distributions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, Madam President, the legislation will allow Wool</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">International to arrange, through a public tender process, a loan facility with a financial institution for the benefit of wool growers who hold entitlement to equity in Wool International. It is expected that this arrangement will produce more advantageous terms than would otherwise be available to borrowers negotiating individually. In performing this function, Wool International will be required to complete the tender process by 31 December 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, having provided wool tax payers with rights in Wool International, the scene is set to enable the liquidation of Wool International and in the meantime, to make interim cash payments to wool tax payers of Wool International equity.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The liquidation of Wool International will take place by removing reference to the privatisation of Wool International currently set out in section 3(3) and parts 10 to 12 of the act. Further, it is necessary to provide in the act for the final wind-up arrangements of Wool International. These include the provision for left-over funds, treatment of small holdings, the final annual report and ensure provision for the wind-up costs of Wool International. It will also provide for a scheme for the distribution of entitlements to the beneficiaries of deceased wool taxpayers and insolvent businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, interim and final payments to wool-tax payers of equity in Wool International is another major aspect of these amendments. Wool-tax payers will receive their interim payment as a cash entitlement. The payout
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to wool-tax payers of funds held under section 51 will not delay the retirement of the debt associated with the stockpile.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act will provide for wool-tax payers to have the option to invest their initial payment, from the first Wool International payout, in a growers investment vehicle which may subsequently invest in a wool logistics and merchanting venture, commonly referred to as `global wool'. But the act will not involve Wool International other than to facilitate investment in the proposed growers trust by those growers who elect to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the act will require Wool International to receive my approval to establish the growers' investment trust. Wool International will be allowed to support preliminary steps in the establishment of the proposed trust, and will also be able to undertake, in a limited way, feasibility studies and related activities for possible investment targets for the trust, including the global wool joint venture proposal. As I have indicated previously, global wool will not proceed without clearance by the Australian competition and consumer commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A final distribution will take place after the stockpile has been sold, and will signal the liquidation of Wool International. It is intended that the stockpile funds after sale and disposal of the stockpile will be the last of the Wool International assets available to wool-tax payers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, these amendments clearly signal the government's withdrawal from the wool market. Wool International will also be required to reduce its activities to the core functions of disposing of the stockpile and retiring the associated debt. This will result in the phasing out of the subsidiary functions of Wool International and the corresponding reduction in the size of the board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision of services to the Australian wool industry, the development of a viable international wool futures market and the development of mechanisms for the sale of wool to allow more efficient management of risk, will be phased out as functions of Wool International.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is, however, necessary to provide for the winding up of several current Wool International functions not associated with selling the stockpile and retiring the associated debt. These are to ensure that Wool International can continue the education program on forward marketing and a market reporting service on a commercial basis. It would be disadvantageous to the industry to remove these functions at this stage and under the legislation these functions will cease by 30 June 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision has been made to give Wool International the role of establishing the growers trust an investment vehicle as I mentioned previously. An end date of 30 June 1998 has been included to ensure Wool International's function in this area is short term and on the basis of a simple facilitation of investment by wool-tax payers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the legislation, madam president, Wool International will be able to spend up to $1 million dollars on the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4598"> establishment of the investment vehicle and in contributions to the development of the global wool proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the functions reduced to only core activities, it is appropriate for the board to be reduced in size. In keeping with the phasing out of subsidiary functions, this is to occur gradually, with the board being reduced from its present number of 11 to 5 by 1 January 1998 as the workload associated with liquidating the organisation declines. I would take this opportunity to thank the retiring board members for their valuable contributions during their service on the board. The composition of the new board will be announced in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, as I stated at the outset, these amendments signal the beginning of the final stage of governnent's involvement in the wool industry. It will of course still collect wool tax on behalf of the industry, contribute to r&amp;d, and continue negotiations with customers on trade access issues. From this point forward the industry will have a clear view of the future and can plan a new, prosperous and independent environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the bill amends the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 to allow Australia to adhere to the International Monetary Fund's New Arrangements to Borrow and to simplify the framework for conducting and recording Australia's other financial transactions with the IMF.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) were developed following the financial crisis in Mexico in late 1994. The Mexican crisis prompted concerns about the adequacy of the IMF's resources in the  event of possible future crises affecting the international monetary system, in view of the growing size and integration of international financial markets. The NAB will double the IMF's capacity to borrow to forestall or cope with an impairment of the international monetary system or to deal with an exceptional situation that poses a threat to the stability of that system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators will be aware that Australia played a key role in the development of the NAB a role with which we can be justly proud. The establishment of the NAB as the IMF's principal borrowing facility will be a milestone for the institution and the international monetary system. Importantly, it will enhance the IMF's ability to safeguard the international monetary system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NAB is open to all IMF members that have the capacity, and are willing, to support the international monetary system and participants will have equal rights and responsibilities. These two features will do much to ensure that the NAB will be a central element in the management of the international financial system into the next century. The wider participation of member countries in the NAB appropriately reflects the changing structure of the world economy.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the NAB, the IMF will be able to borrow up to SDR34 billion (or about $A61 billion) from the NAB participants. Australians share of these credit arrangements is SDR810 million (or about $A1.5 billion). In the event of a call, Australia would lend directly to the IMF and would receive a claim against the Fund. The bill provides that any loan to the IMF will be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the NAB, there is scope for Australia to opt out of calls if the government determines that we will not be able to meet them because of our present and prospective balance of payments and reserve position. We may also, on the basis of a balance of payments need, require early repayment of part or all of any loan we have made to the IMF.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, Australia undertakes a number of regular financial transactions with the IMF. These include the receipt of interest on Special Drawing Right holdings, interest payments on the use of Special Drawing Rights, quota payments and remuneration received for the use of Australian dollars by the IMF. The bill introduces a simplified framework for the conduct and recording of these transactions. Under the existing arrangements, some of Australia's financial transactions with the IMF are conducted by the transfer of Special Drawing Rights between the Commonwealth and the Reserve Bank and corresponding changes in the Bank's retransfer liability to the Commonwealth. Under the new framework, the Commonwealth would purchase and sell all the SDRs required to undertake these transactions with the Fund. This will provide for a more transparent and cost efficient framework for such transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is desirable that these changes be introduced at the same time as Australia takes up its membership of the New Arrangements to Borrow to ensure that all of these transactions are conducted in a consistent framework.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the amendments proposed in the bill will have no impact on the Commonwealth Budget. The changes proposed to the conduct of Australia's financial transactions with the Fund affect transactions which are, by accepted international standards, classified as financing transactions. Any loan by the Commonwealth to the IMF under the NAB would also be classified as a financing transaction because loans to the IMF represent monetary assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The participants in the NAB have agreed that they will meet once a year, in addition to any meetings needed for activation, renewal or amendment of the NAB. The objective of these meetings is to review and discuss macroeconomic and financial market developments, especially those that could have an impact on the stability of the international financial system and lead to a possible need for the Fund to seek supplementary resources. This is potentially an important new forum for consideration of these issues. The chairmanship of the NAB will rotate between participants and Australia is expected to provide the first chairman.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That the High Court of Australia (Fees) Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1997 No. 106 and made under the Judiciary Act 1903, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That the High Court of Australia (Fees) Regulations (Amendment), as contained in  Statutory Rules 1997 No. 106 and made under the Judiciary Act 1903, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This disallowance motion is an important issue in relation to the much talked about question of access to justice. This government is obsessed with the concept of cost recovery, and the fee increases we are attempting to disallow today are part of the ongoing process of charging the public for access to what were previously considered public or community services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought that the provision of an accessible justice system was part of an open and democratic society. Taxpayers expect to receive fundamental services such as a court system in return for paying their annual tax return. If the revenue from taxation is not sufficient to pay for those services then we should be examining ways in which to increase that revenue, not charging people for services such as courts on a user&hyphen;pays basis. The consequences of moving to a user&hyphen;pays system is that the most vulnerable in our society who may need access to the courts and other aspects of the justice system cannot pay and are denied access to justice. That is clearly unacceptable.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the Attorney&hyphen;General's office have briefed me on this issue and have pointed to the procedures for a waiver of the fees on the grounds of hardship, the problem with such a system is that many people in a situation of hardship are not aware of such schemes. Of course, with a decline of legal aid funding, they will increasingly find it difficult to get advice from lawyers who can advise them of such options. It is a vicious circle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that many of the fees contained in these regulations have increased by up to five times the amount. The fee for a special leave application to the High Court, for example, has increased from $2,000 to $10,000. The daily hearing fee has increased from $1,500 to $12,000. Whilst it is acknowledged that wealthy corporations will also be required to pay these increases, with a doubling in many cases of the basic fees, the reality is that such increases work in favour of the corporations that can play the game of pursuing legal avenues all the way to the High Court without any relatively great financial hardship. What is $12,000 or even $20,000 to a multibillion dollar company? The general community, however, who are going to be increasingly left to themselves to pursue action against these corporations, will find it difficult to match such funding and, consequently, will have their access to justice severely limited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to look at what is happening here in conjunction with the other changes that this government is imposing: changes to legal aid, to areas such as the Environmental Defender's Office&mdash;for having the audacity to try to defend the environment&mdash;changes through the community to try to shut people up, a discovery that certain laws should not be defended, that it is okay for governments to break certain of their own laws. Just imagine the outcry if this was a tax law or a corporations law. But about other laws, where the community at large is concerned, the government is saying, `Shut up, we don't want to know.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not good enough, and it is not good enough that we are turning into a society that is trying to control people's thoughts and stop them from standing up and speaking for
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4600"> themselves or, more importantly, for justice&mdash;speaking up for what is right and requiring, heaven forbid, that the government obey its own laws. That is extremely important. It is so important that we must, today, stand up and fight against this issue.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nothing is more critical to a cohesive society than access to justice. The measure we are discussing today goes very much to the heart of that. It is about rights being of value, it is about accessing rights. On this side of parliament, we believe that we should not have the impediment of user pays in the way of people accessing their rights. When some people can and some people cannot access their rights, and that distinction is based on the capacity of someone to pay, you have a very much divided society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This view was best stated by the Chief Justice of Australia in a High Court case on the matter of citizen limbo in a 1989 judgment. I think it is worth putting this quote on record. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a person has a legal right to enforce or a legal defence to offer to another's claim, the imposition of substantial fees restricting access to the courts of law may place that person, unless he be affluent, outside the law's protection. In a society governed by the law, no barrier can be erected against reasonable access to the courts for the vindication and protection of legal rights. To ensure that litigation is not frivolously commenced, modest fees have traditionally been exacted but the courts have reserved a dispensing discretion to ensure that, where litigation can be seen to be justifiable, poverty is no bar to the operation of law.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The principle of access to justice is one that is critical to our society. It underpinned the previous Labor government's justice statement. It also was reflected, before the election, by statements from the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are talking about here is access to the highest court in the country, a court which has the role of clarifying the law and the constitution, putting detail on legislation that is passed by parliament and developing the common law. As such, its role is very much complementary to the role of parliament. It has a special role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to remember in respect of this role that only a very few cases get to the High
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Court. Some 13 years ago the proviso was that any litigant who was dissatisfied with a state or federal appeal court could go to the High Court if the matter was worth more than $20,000. That was replaced by the system we now have, a system where matters of important legal issue of criminal, constitutional and civil law can be heard by the High Court only by special leave of the High Court&mdash;so you have to have an important point of law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government is seeking to do now is to introduce a new means test, a test where, to apply for leave, for instance, you have to pay $10,000, instead of some $2,000 currently and instead of the much smaller amount which applied before this government changed the fees last year. On top of that $10,000, you have already had to pay the costs in the court of appeal and your lawyers' fees as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us remember also that some 75 per cent of applications for leave are refused, so it is only a very small number of critically important matters that go to the High Court. Let us also remember that, if you do get leave granted, the appellant pays $10,000 for notice of appeal, compared to $2,000 before these fees, $8,000 for a hearing fee&mdash;just to get listed&mdash;compared to $3,000 before these fees were introduced and $12,000 for each day in court, compared to $1,500. You are talking about a monumental hike here. It is no wonder that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> made it clear in a very pertinent editorial a few days ago that their view was that, in considering the principles of access to justice, there is a lot more to consider than the question of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One winner continually in all this&mdash;and Senator Margetts got this right&mdash;is the executive. What we have here is not just one measure in isolation but a measure in the context of a whole range of other measures. We have cuts to legal aid. We have fees of this nature. We have governments deciding and contemplating radical changes to tribunals&mdash;tribunals which are there to ensure that those without resources have access to a mechanism to ensure government treats them properly and within the principles of natural justice and fairness.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4601">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those tribunals are now being radically reassessed. I gather from reports that they are going to be abolished and replaced by some business&hyphen;type operation which will be run by a chief executive officer and will have to follow government policy, as opposed to the law. Fees are being contemplated for them, and so on. At the same time, resources for ombudsmen are being cut back and human rights resources are being cut back monumentally. We can add and add. We can talk about the Environmental Defender's office and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only access to justice people may be left with at the end of this government's program of denying access to justice may very well be section 75 of the constitution and access to the High Court. It is for this reason that we need to have a very close look at what we are doing here, because the winner will be the executive. People will not have a capacity to fight, and even those who are poor, who have access to the court because of exemption procedures, will have to worry about the costs they will have to pay if they lose the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the impacts of these changes. What I would like to do&mdash;and I have not had a chance to discuss this with the other side&mdash;is incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a schedule of comparison sent to us by Chris Pullin QC, President of the Australian Bar Association, which sets out the fee differentials. The schedule from the Australian Bar Association shows that, had you, for instance, taken a High Court case before the change of government, you would have had to pay some $3,000 by way of leave application, notice of appeal and hearing fee; if you were to take the same case under these provisions, you would pay close to $49,000 or $50,000 to run the same sort of case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a monumental grab for cash. As Mr Pullin has quite clearly explained in letters to all members of parliament and to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, if you were a small business wanting to run a case in the High Court seeking justice, before you even paid your lawyers' fees and before you even take into account all the appeal fees that you have
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> incurred on the way through, you would have to pay $49,300 for one day in court. This is obscene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, the poor may have some access; the rich will definitely have access; John Elliott will be able to rename the High Court his Princes Park; but small business people and people in between will just not be able to access justice. User pays is not appropriate when it comes to access to courts. It is not appropriate when it comes to access to the High Court. If you look at these figures and the motivation for it, you have to ask yourself, would there have been a Mabo case if these sorts of the fees had applied? Would there have been a Wik case? Would there have been cases that have over the years established in our constitutional framework concepts of access to justice, fair hearing and so on? Some of them may have got through and Senator Ellison will say to us, `Well, those people are exempt from fees,'&mdash;and well he might. You should never underestimate the threat of having to pay lawyers' fees if you lose the case. That is something that exemptions do not adequately cater for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are concerned about these fees. We were concerned about fees last year and we tried to bounce the government's proposals then. As I say, we are talking about these fees on top of a very large increase last year. The schedule of Mr Pullin QC will demonstrate that better than I will be able to in the time I have here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me finish on two particular points. In the estimates process we asked the Attorney-General's Department how they actually came up with the figures and how they actually decided to levy the fees and charges that they have decided to levy. We initially asked them what modelling they did on the impact of these increases, either on small businesses or on the individual. The answer from Mr Skehill was that they did not do any. We then asked how they actually came up with the fees and charges. How did they decide what was appropriate? The answer then was that essentially they had a certain amount that they had to raise, they put that amount into a computer, and these are the figures that fell out.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4602"> I am paraphrasing Mr Skehill's words. They put the figures in a computer, pressed a few buttons and these are the figures that came out. There was no modelling, no consideration of access to justice and no real consideration as to whether one fee was appropriate in terms of their benchmark in trying to achieve 30 per cent cost recovery in comparison to state jurisdictions and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our view is a very strong one and that is that the government is here just running a grab for cash and in their grab for cash they have really ignored those basic principles of democracy, access to justice and of people&mdash;rich or poor&mdash;having a capacity to access the highest court in the land. They have also ignored the fact that, of those very few cases that go to the High Court, most of them&mdash;in fact all of them&mdash;have to have a public interest component. The litigants are actually paying the fees to clarify the law for all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the words of a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> editorial of 18 June:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is an unconscionable use of power by the Commonwealth government. It will prevent some  important legal issues from being heard by the High Court. It should be rejected by this Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset let me say that these fee increases are designed to increase the High Court's present cost recovery rate of 12 per cent to 30 per cent. That brings it in line with other measures which the Commonwealth announced in previous fee increases for other courts. Most importantly, it brings it into line with the average fee recovery in the various state and territory courts across this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that the point Senator Bolkus made that indeed we might not see another Mabo is quite incorrect, because for a start that case was in receipt of legal aid funding and we do have a waiver or existing exemption provision which relates to those people who are in receipt of legal aid, Austudy, Abstudy or in possession of a card entitling them to Commonwealth health benefits. People who fall within those categories would be entitled to a waiver. To say that, if someone is impecunious, they are put at a disadvantage by these fee increases is quite wrong. The truth is that they are eligible
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4604"> for a waiver and, in any event, you can still apply to the registrar to waive the necessary fees. That decision is subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am on that point of waiver, it is important to note&mdash;and the opposition should take note of this&mdash;that all criminal matters are exempt from these fees. What we are talking about are matters in the civil jurisdiction or pertaining to constitutional law. We are not talking about matters which are in the criminal jurisdiction. Of the applications that were eligible for fees in the year 1995-96, 10 per cent of those fees were waived on application. In that year of 1995-96, only two applications were refused. One can see that that exemption was not exercised in a manner which was exclusive, but rather inclusive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that year there were some 516 matters attracting a filing fee. When you look at the matters which actually reached hearing&mdash;37 were civil, seven were criminal and 17 fell into the constitutional jurisdiction&mdash;you can see that the civil jurisdiction is by far the greater area attracting the High Court's attention. In this area you have large corporations taking matters to the High Court. It is not a situation where the majority of High Court matters are being brought by individuals, people who are in receipt of legal aid, people who would fit into the battlers category. You have in the High Court many cases which are brought by multinational companies, companies and associations which are well funded and well resourced. It is important to remember that, at the end of the day, of those 516 matters, there was a small number of hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bolkus alluded to this in his address when he stated that most matters were refused at the stage of application for special leave. So it should be, because that is where you sort out the wheat from the chaff. But  that, in itself, takes up a great deal of High Court time. The High Court has to list those for hearing, it has to open a file and it has to process them. That is where you have a great deal of cost, a cost which cannot be ignored. The cost of running the High Court is exorbitant, and these costs just cannot be allowed to run away unchecked. In the current system
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there are safeguards for those who are impecunious, as I have outlined. There is the waiver of fees and, in any event, there is the availability of legal aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So to couch this in the terms of denial of justice or that this is an attempt by the government to deny people access to the High Court is just not true. In fact it is quite mischievous to say that. What we are doing here is bringing the High Court into line with other courts in the states and territories of this land and other measures which have been passed by this Senate in relation to other Commonwealth jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government had the most responsible task of ensuring that we cut back on the deficit which we inherited from the previous government&mdash;in excess of $10 billion. It is projected that by next year we will have that figure in the black by $1.6 billion. We cannot afford to let up on our cost recovery across the board until that figure is achieved, until we have done for the Australian people what we said we would do&mdash;that is, to put the accounts into the black. We cannot say, `The Attorney-General's portfolio is exempt.' Like all other portfolios, it is subject to cutbacks and an increase in cost revenue or cost recovery. It is only appropriate that all the courts be brought into line. The High Court is no exception to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cases such as the Mabo decision and the Brandy decision will continue to happen in Australia. There will be no denial of any application of that sort. Those sorts of people who bring those applications, if they have merit, will be heard by the High Court and, if those people are impecunious, they will be granted a waiver. If they do not fall into the categories I have mentioned, there is the safety net of applying to the registrar for an exemption. If you are not happy with the registrar's decision, you can take it to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I do not think we can be fairer than that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This government cloaks itself in the mantle of economic respectability that anything which means you can balance your budget makes it acceptable to cut costs or
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4605"> raise fees wherever you like. Of course, you will not have a crack at the Defence department or anything which you really enjoy. You will have a crack at those institutions which you do not enjoy. I have discovered, in watching what has been going on in this place in the past year, that we do not have an Attorney-General who defends justice and access to it, but one who attacks it and is not protecting our institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats will be supporting disallowance motion No. 4, as it is entirely consistent with the longstanding Democrats' opposition to economically rationalising the judicial arm of government in this country. We think that this move does not represent a question of fees and economics. We think this is part of an overall onslaught which will affect access to justice, which will limit and constrain it and which will result in it being part of an elitist approach to having access to justice only where you can afford it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to put this into the perspective of all the other things you have done. You cut legal aid back, you raise fees in the lower courts, you raise fees in the higher courts and you assault the High Court in the media. This has to be seen in the perspective of this whole package. My colleague the Reverend Senator Woodley describes it as the corporatist state&mdash;the ascendancy of economic fundamentalism as a universal criteria for the development of public policy. In this instance, it is our opinion that it contributes to limiting access to justice in Australia. Your view, and I am distressed to hear you defend it, is that nothing is worth paying for, nothing is sacred from the view that you have to pay your way.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3M6">Senator MURRAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You may have exemptions. The overall approach is such that people will find it harder and harder to access our courts. In the long history of theology, of  philosophy, of civilisation and of history, the highest authorities have always made themselves accessible and open to the common people. The words you speak deny those very fundamental elements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not actually comprehend, I do not think, the way in which you are chipping
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> away at the most fundamental and important element in our society: justice being free and accessible to those who need it, not efficiency and user&hyphen;pays driven in every respect. The Australian Democrats' opposition to the notion that the court should be responsible for their own cost recovery is well documented. Such a user&hyphen;pays principle is entirely contrary to the universal principle of access of ordinary people to justice, particularly&mdash;not exceptionally&mdash;to the highest courts in the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The deceit in your user&hyphen;pays logic, to us, is obvious. We say that the purpose of revenue raising is that the public pays for the services that it wants. It already pays for political and legal institutions. It already pays for the Defence department, for education, for health. What is absent from your view is that, in the system which is created under our present constitution, that constitution puts down the desire that the court should be readily accessible to our citizens as a birthright of the citizens of this country. It is what we offer as a nation&mdash;it is part of our nation, in fact: the right of all Australians to access and participate in our system of government, should they choose to. We part company from Senator Ellison on the fundamental principle that access to the courts should not be interfered with by financial considerations. There are other considerations far more important to that which go to the heart of our attachment to the rule of law which we believe take priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last decade the recognition of the rights of Australian citizens, particularly indigenous citizens in terms of the government's view of the High Court, has been a bugbear for governments in this country. The hysteria led by the Deputy Prime Minister, now the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), after the Wik decision is just an example of the irritability that the High Court is causing for the reactionary and fundamentalist side of politics in this country, but those opposite should bear in mind that the courts are often the most conservative elements of our society. Those of us on the progressive side of politics find that to advance the cause of environmentalism, of Aboriginal rights or of anything else is a long, uphill battle. Those
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4606"> courts are there to balance the interests of society, both from the conservative side and from the social and progressive side, and they have done as much for your side of politics as for us on our side of politics over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see the rule of law as a fundamental tenet of democracy, and we believe that that rule of law is challenged by the present government&mdash;unless, of course, they see it as operating to their advantage. We do not doubt that, if the Wik decision had swung in favour of the pastoralists&mdash;and we believe that the Wik decision as it stands did quite well by them&mdash;there would have been little comment from the National Party or the government about the way in which the High Court functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot have it both ways. You cannot have a democracy governed by the rule of law and enforced by an independent judiciary under the separation of powers doctrine and then call foul when decisions do not go your way. In our constitutional system of government, the High Court is the ultimate umpire whether you like it or not and whether we like it or not. We do not appreciate the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), the government and the Deputy Prime Minister in particular continually attacking this particular institution. It erodes one of the basic protections we have in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my speech in the second reading debate on the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996 I incorporated a table of the last set of court fee increases brought into effect by last year's budget. I note, and I repeat for the benefit of the Senate, that the disallowance motion for those fees was defeated when Senator Colston and Senator Harradine supported the government. I repeat that we do not regard those fee increases as being an economic matter; we regard them as attacking our institutions where we want increased access to them and increased availability of justice for citizens  who need it. What we need much more of in the intermediary process is conciliation and arbitration, which prevents people having to take on governments, companies and each other on an adversarial basis.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the High Court alone these fees represent the following marked increases: for applications made under rule 1, order 55, 172 per cent for individual applicants and 443 per cent for corporate ones&mdash;this is from a government which says what a wonderful job it is doing about inflation; that is not helping inflation&mdash;for a writ of summons or petition, 172 per cent for individuals and 443 per cent for corporations&mdash;so much for supporting small business; for civil special leave applications, 308 per cent for individuals and 716 per cent for corporations; for applications under section 40 of the Judiciary Act, 713 per cent for individuals and 1,526 per cent for corporations&mdash;that sounds like 1930s inflation; for notices of civil appeal, 172 per cent for individuals and 443 per cent for corporations; and for setting down fees for civil appeals, 144 per cent for individuals and 387 per cent for corporations. And transcripts per page have increased by 1,650 per cent for both individuals and corporations. In any respect these are astronomical fee increases&mdash;not keeping pace with inflation. These increases were introduced by this government not less than 12 months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Conservative estimates by the legal profession now say that, if these court fees proceed, a one&hyphen;day appeal hearing in the High Court of Australia will cost on average $40,000. That is more than the average salary of an Australian. It is extraordinary that, in a society which should be democratic, should champion the cause of access to justice, should pride itself in being governed by the rule of law, we are requiring citizens who are forced to go all the way up to the High Court to forgo a year's salary or more for one day in court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate that you say there are exceptions, but the fact is that that is the overall result for everyone. As we well know, many court cases run for a number of days or even weeks, and it is foreseeable that, given that most people's chief asset is their home, in deciding whether or not to pursue their case people will quite literally have to contemplate losing the roof over their heads. What we must always consider in these matters is not the big boys who compete in these things, but the small person and what the effect of losing
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4607"> has on them. Many people risk a great deal to pursue things that matter to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirteen years ago all Australians had the right to have their case heard in the High Court as long as their claims amounted to $20,000 or more. It seems an odd cut&hyphen;off to me to do it by money but, anyway, that is what it was. The consequence, of course, is that a huge workload was created for the High Court, and cases, which were limited then, were required to be restrained somewhat. Appeals are now taken to the High Court only if they are granted by special leave. We have to ask, if there is so much demand for these institutions, what does it say about the way in which we resolve our problems within society?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome, incidentally, some of the other things the Attorney&hyphen;General has been doing, such as looking at the resolution of disputes and making the courts work far better at the lower end. So let me not blacken your name completely as a government; you are certainly addressing some of the issues about demand and management of cases. I appreciate that and I want to give you the recognition for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scenario that these increases would see occur is this: if these fee increases are not disallowed, for a person to even request special leave to appeal will cost them $10,000 instead of the $2,000 at present. That is just to get their case listed. If special leave to appeal is granted, and in 75 per cent of cases it is not, the applicant must shell out another $10,000, an increase from the present $2,000, to take out a notice of appeal. By this stage they are already up to $20,000 and the case will not have been heard yet, and all the time their solicitors' and barristers' fees will be ticking over. And, of course, legal aid is harder to get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To get the case on what is called the list, another $8,000 will need to be paid. This has been increased from the present $3,000. The grand prize in this hike in court fees goes to  the daily hearing fee, presently $1,500&mdash;up to $12,000 a day. That is for every day a person spends in court.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not need to be reminded that evidence currently before the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee inquiring into legal aid reveals that civil appeals have long since ceased to be funded in almost all jurisdictions. The option for Australians wishing to access their right to justice is now clear: you pay more than your annual salary and possibly you risk your home just for your day or days in court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government may think it is desirable to discourage people as much as it can from going to court. I say to you that, unless you have an alternative process whereby they can resolve their differences, you have to continue to allow them to have that access. Your fee increases will decrease access to justice, will limit access to justice and will attack a fundamental principle in our system that access to justice and the rule of law is required to be pursued and promoted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that this sort of thing just adds to the overall view of your government as one which really has some very mean&hyphen;spirited and hard attitudes to Australians and their needs, both at the most fundamental level of their constitutional rights and their philosophies and principles, and at the ordinary day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day level as to how they can earn their living, whether they can get a job and whether they can live in a society where people are tolerant of one another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have told you before, Senator Ellison, that I consider you to be a decent and honourable person. I would urge you to influence your government to reconsider their whole approach and their whole attitude to these questions on the way in which law and justice is to be approached in our society. We live in a society which is getting increasingly aggressive, increasingly insecure, increasingly uncertain, increasingly bothered about what is happening to it and what its prospects are. It is not good enough just to stand up and say, `Look, in terms of economics, this is how it all works.' Those people are crying out and saying, `We are not just an economic unit. Our lives are not just run by economics. We do not want to hear just about economics. We want, for once, to hear that this is right because it is right, not because it costs mon
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4608"> ey.' Of course it costs money. Adding these fees is not going to stop the court system costing money. They want to know that you will protect and preserve the institutions and the rights and the important things that matter to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not opposing this because it is my job to oppose the government; I am opposing this because it reflects an overall philosophy and an approach which we think does damage to our system and is not warranted and affects everyone: small corporations, individuals and community groups. The only people who can really afford this are the big people in the world, and mostly they can look after themselves.</PARA></SPEECH>

I commend Senator Ellison for that effort. But it was a defence, sadly, of the indefensible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year, when there were considerable increases, they were actually not disallowed by this parliament. I was really surprised to see the additional increases that were imposed this year by these regulations. I had not really expected them, I must say. Might I also say that I do not know whether too many other people had expected them either. No doubt these matters were under due consideration over a period of time within the department and no doubt the department had been required to come up with something that would go to some extent to cost recovery, and they have lighted on this figure of 30 per cent, which is said to be the figure that applies to cost recovery, as a general rule of thumb, in other jurisdictions, in other courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been said in this debate, we are dealing with the High Court, and that is a very special court indeed. As has been indicated, you need special leave to go to the High Court. The matters that are to be dealt with by the High Court are, by definition, matters which must meet the public import ance criterion. They must be matters of significant public importance. Section 75 matters&mdash;that is, original jurisdiction mat
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ters&mdash;are set down in the constitution and we cannot do anything about those. But by definition, if one looks at section 75 matters, they are matters of considerable public interest and public importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two questions here that are raised in one's mind: one is the right of persons to have their day in court and the other is the role of the High Court in the clarification of laws that are passed in this country. With regard to the first question, I know that the parliamentary secretary, Senator Ellison, of all people, is very interested in the area of access to justice. I indicate that, so far as that is concerned, there are problems with regard to fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Ellison has said that there are waivers. He has indicated that there were only two applications last year&mdash;I thought he said only two applications; it may have been three or four&mdash;that were refused waiver. Two applications for that sort of assistance were actually refused. But one has to go back one step and ask: how many others would have not got over the barrier had that barrier been too high? The point that I am making is that I think that the fees, as listed in these regulations, are a further hurdle to access to justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not delay the Senate long. The role of the High Court, as provided for in the constitution, is to clarify the laws of the nation. From memory, section 76 gives this parliament the power to decide these particular matters. I know that a great deal of concern has been expressed by a number of people about the problem of judge-made laws. Laws are to be made, really, by the democratically elected members of parliament, and that is a very important principle of democracy. We should not go down the track of judge-made laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, we should not impede access by appellants to the High Court in order to have clarified the laws which are binding on those appellants, and that, as we are all well aware, is not an easy task. Special leave must be obtained. Something like 75 to 80 per cent of requests for special leave were overturned in the last 12 months.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4609">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, I just do not feel that I could support, even in a negative sense, this regulation. As has been indicated in this debate and elsewhere, the increases are enormous. The increases that have occurred since 1992 are enormous&mdash;500 per cent; and even higher than 500 per cent. I just simply say to the chamber that I do not think, overall, I am in a position to negatively support the government even by abstaining. I am aware that if I abstain from the vote on this matter, it may be carried by other means. But I am supporting the disallowance motion on this particular occasion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In closing this debate, I will not be holding up the Senate unduly. I would like to thank all of the senators who have made a contribution in today's debate. I do believe it has been a very important debate. It has been about justice and it has been about access to justice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not have government by fear. It should not be that contracts within society, which even the right wing of any society tends to hold up&mdash;including the contract that a government makes with society in relation to the constitution and the contract that a government makes when forming laws&mdash;are enforceable contracts. It should not be that some laws are enforceable and that they cannot be challenged in the highest courts of the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to mention a couple of the debating points that were made by Senator Ellison. He said cost recovery was appropriate. No, not at this level&mdash;not in terms of access to justice. These are not appropriate cost recovery mechanisms. He said that, in relation to cases like Mabo and Brandy, there would be no denial of justice, that test cases would be run if they have merit. Who will be deciding if they have merit? Who, in the final analysis, will make that decision. If it is the government&mdash;if it is government people and government decisions&mdash;surely that is not a valid argument. In whose opinion? Who decides? If often the case of whether a person does not have to pay fees is based on whether they  have access to legal aid, you have to go back to that circular argument. Fewer and fewer
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people are going to be able to access legal aid. That level of eligibility&mdash;because of funding cuts&mdash;is smaller and smaller. If access to legal aid means that a person gets access to exemptions from fees, that means fewer and fewer people will fall into those categories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Ellison says that there is always the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Well, guess what? A person needs funds to access the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as well. They need legal assistance to get that and, if they are having trouble getting legal assistance either through legal aid or through organisations like the Environmental Defender's Office&mdash;which was the one that recently assisted pensioner Len Howard to get a clarification of what the government should have been doing in terms of releasing documents&mdash;then you are going around in circles: we do not give it to you, so you cannot get it, so we will not give you the exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a real problem and this has been recognised by the very good arguments that have been made today. I commend this disallowance motion to the Senate. I hope that the message that has been given by all opposition senators and by the community clearly and unequivocally is accepted by the government. We know that charges were imposed by the previous Labor government. We are standing up for basic access&mdash;when that is taken away from the grasp of ordinary people. This is the principle upon which we stand today.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That regulations 11 and 12 of the Austudy Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1997 No. 83 and made under the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In moving this disallowance motion, I would like to emphasise the importance of this measure to the Senate. It directly relates to young people&mdash;single students&mdash;without dependents who share accommodation. They are being directly penalised by the actions of this government. These are actions that were taken in the 1996-97 budget. This will be the last of a series of measures coming through that go to the removal of half a billion dollars in assistance to students through various changes to Austudy and Abstudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures specifically reduce by one-third the maximum rent assistance available to single students without dependents who share accommodation from 1 July this year. The government will argue that this is a proposition that ought to be supported because it will effectively be in line with the Department of Social Security measures which will also cut rent assistance payments to some persons, which were dealt with in the Senate last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to emphasise to senators that this measure is different. While technically in line with those measures being taken in the social security arena, this measure is different because the circumstances and the experience of students are different. As we have seen in the last two days, the government has announced changes with regard to youth assistance, which make this problem all the more difficult for students. It will make the situation all the more difficult for those students if this principle is accepted by way of regulation, the principles of which are outlined in these particular regulations that the government is seeking to put into force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is sending out two quite contradictory messages with these new policy announcements on the youth allowance which, in the end, I suppose, boil down to the one message. On the one hand, they are saying that students and people who require rent assistance should not share accommodation. That is effectively what they are saying. They are saying, `If you share accommodation,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4611"> your level of assistance should be reduced because it is argued that there are fewer costs.' I will argue that that is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are also suggesting that if you live at home, which they say they are trying to encourage people to do to actually build family values or some such measure, you will not receive any assistance at all. What this new youth allowance proposes, which is directly related to this fundamental principle being established in this particular set of regulations, is that persons under 18 not at school will lose $145 per fortnight. However, under the government's family taxation initiatives, they will receive some $18 per fortnight. The disparity could not be more stark. On the one hand, the government is saying that there will be an increased requirement by state policy for parents to take increasing responsibilities for the support of young people in this country. On the other hand, at the same time they are imposing additional costs on families to meet the various requirements for education, health and a whole range of other areas which actually make it more difficult for families to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, on the one hand, what we have is students being deprived of assistance by the government and forced into the social security system because of the breakdown in the various policies this government has been instituting while, on the other hand, at the same time, families are actually having assistance, which would enable them to assist various members of the family, taken away from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular measure highlights the special case for students. Students do not have flexibility; they do not have the opportunity to pick and choose where they live because they are tied to a particular location&mdash;that is, somewhere near the particular institution at which they are studying. In those localities, where the demand for accommodation of a particular type is often high, it is in fact necessary to share with others to reduce costs. Rent assistance is required all the more for students because of the special circumstances under which they study. I will come to that in more detail later.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the final change of a range of changes to Austudy that were introduced in last year's budget. A whole series of measures were taken to undermine that fundamental principle of the government's responsibility to actually assist people to stay at school, at university and at TAFE colleges. In fact, a whole series of measures&mdash;all negative&mdash;were introduced in the last budget which, in total, added up to some $&half; billion in cuts to student assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular measure the government is seeking to introduce will save the government some $700,000 over four years. However, if the principle is accepted by the Senate, there will be much greater savings to the government with the introduction of the youth allowance, which extends rent assistance to a far broader number of students than presently is the case. In fact, the number of applicants for rent assistance will increase. But this particular measure will actually restrict their capacity to claim under the new youth allowance provisions. The reduction of the maximum amount payable to singles in shared accommodation will become far more significant in that context in terms of the number of people who will be directly affected by this particular measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to understand precisely what sorts of people we are talking about when we discuss these measures. We are not talking about people who have a lot of money; we are talking about people who must fit into one of the following categories to get this assistance: you have to be homeless, which is an irony in the sense that you are trying to provide rental assistance for people; you have to have parents who are unable to provide a home or carer support; you have to be an orphan; you have to be a refugee with no parents in Australia; you have to be in state care getting away&hyphen;from&hyphen;home rates and living away from your foster carer's home. In other words, we are talking about the very people who are most in need of assistance, who are already facing very severe disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Austudy, as we all understand, is designed to help people complete their education. This obviously provides some benefit to them and to society as a whole. People who receive rent
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4612"> assistance are perfect examples of the sorts of persons Austudy was designed to directly assist. It is somewhat ironic to reduce the benefits to those persons and undermine their capacity to successfully complete their education at a time when the government is actually saying that there ought to be a greater emphasis on people staying at university, at TAFE and at school.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is clearly not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The measures that you have introduced will try to reduce some $&half; billion worth of assistance to Austudy. In order to assess such assistance, students need to be paying a certain amount of rent, a threshold amount, before they can receive any assistance. It is not like getting a bonus. There is actually a requirement in this provision to pay the money out before you can get the rental assistance. Of course, above this threshold, three&hyphen;quarters of what is paid by way of rent is then paid to the student in the form of rent assistance, which itself is subject to a ceiling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are not talking about some sort of windfall gain here to people who might not need it; we are talking particularly about a very disadvantaged group of people who are required to undertake study at particular universities and colleges, at particular educational sites, which are often in inner city areas, in areas with high rent, in areas where there is a requirement to share accommodation to reduce costs. As I say, the very special circumstances of students makes it necessary for assistance such as this to be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government is proposing to do is to penalise them for actually being required to attend a particular educational institution and find accommodation in a particular area close to that institution. The government is about to reduce the weekly rate of rental assistance&mdash;and these are the huge amounts of money that are actually involved&mdash;for such
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people from $37.30 to $24.90. This is hardly a king's ransom, but to the individual it is of great significance&mdash;particularly individuals who fit into such disadvantaged categories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure will immediately affect around 2,600 people. It is likely that some of those people will find it too difficult to continue their studies. One of my great concerns about this measure is that it runs contrary to what I think all of us here would acknowledge is important&mdash;encouraging people to go to university and TAFE colleges to undertake further study, to participate in the education system and to enjoy the benefits of that education system, not just for themselves but for the benefit of the country as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the commencement of the youth allowance on 1 July next year, some 70,000 full-time students who are currently Austudy recipients will be eligible for rental assistance. Those who are single and living in shared accommodation, which I would suggest well might be a significant proportion of them, will suffer because of this change. In fact, the precedent is being established now with a small group of some 2,600 people, and it will later apply to a much larger number of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has said that the youth allowance is not a savings measure. The truth of that matter is that we have not seen the full details of the costings, so we do not really know. In the 15 months that this government has been in office, I have lost confidence in their capacity to tell the truth when it comes to the issues of what programs cost and how the money is being spent. You cannot rely upon a ministerial press release to tell you what is going on. You cannot even rely on the budget papers to tell you what is going on. You cannot assume, just because the government says that a certain measure is not going to be a savings measure, that that will be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have an example which quite clearly points to this situation. What we are talking about today is a savings measure which is in advance. The government is taking away an entitlement to maximise rent assistance before the rent assistance is provided. It is caught
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4613"> securing a savings measure, in an underhanded way, without declaring it as such in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims that the youth allowance is designed to encourage young people to study. Yet, as I have said, last year's budget reduces student assistance expenditure by some $513 million over four years. That represents a substantial attack upon the income support for students. These students do not enjoy millionaire status, as the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) would have liked us to believe when she dredged up the fictitious Wright family. This assistance is designed to assist people who already are substantially disadvantaged and are in real need of support from this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I see it, this action can take a place amongst the unjustified and mean&hyphen;spirited changes to Austudy which were introduced last year. It can stand beside the cessation of case management for secondary students on the homeless rate of Austudy and Abstudy, beside the cessation of schooling and incidental allowances for the same homeless students, beside the tightening of the means test, which Senator Vanstone turned into an administrative nightmare, and beside the raising of the age of independence which, apart from being inequitable, is impacting particularly unfairly on some students who, for technical reasons, are considered dependent on their parents, when in reality they have led independent lives for years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, this measure is a miserable device to inflict greater pain on families, not to provide additional support. It comes at a time when this government has introduced a whole range of measures across an array of portfolios. It is inappropriate for us to say that families should be encouraged to take on additional responsibilities for the support of students at schools when this government is not meeting its obligation in that regard. In fact, it is reducing its commitment to the provision of support to allow people to enjoy the benefits of participating in the education system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, it is a mean, nasty and miserable measure aimed at inflicting greater pain and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> suffering on young Australians who are seeking to improve their position, and reach their full potential in life by participating in education. I urge the Senate to support this disallowance motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting the disallowance motion before the chamber today. I agree with the comments of my colleague. I believe that the measure designed to reduce by a third the amount of rent assistance available to single students living in shared accommodation, to be introduced as of 1 July this year, is penny&hyphen;pinching, mean and nasty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that, with the announcement of a common youth allowance, one of the ironies of this week is the government's boasting about the proposal to extend availability of rent assistance to students living away from home but, at the same time&mdash;this very week, in fact&mdash;it looks like the government will vote against attempts to stop the reduction of that rent assistance for students in shared accommodation. It is quite ironic when we are moving towards a system where families are increasingly expected to deal with financial burdens and economic hardship in supporting dependent children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I say `children', I am talking about 16&hyphen;, 17&hyphen;, 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds and upwards. These are not children. These are young adults with the same expenses and, in many cases, responsibilities and burdens as other members of the community. But that seems to be lost by many members in this place and in other decision making institutions. For that reason, the Democrats will support the disallowance of regulations 11 and 12, which is being moved today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of this measure, around 2,600 students are expected to lose as much as $24 a fortnight. That is an additional $24 a fortnight that they would have had to help pay the rent. This is when these people are receiving a maximum of around $264.70 a fortnight, and $24 equates to a little under 10 per cent of the total standard Austudy payment. That is based on the independent rate, which, as most of us know, would be the most generous amount, yet I think that would
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4614"> equate to around 60 per cent of the poverty line levels. So $24 a fortnight, to some people in this place, may not seem a lot to lose, but it is a substantial amount for students on Austudy who are struggling to make ends meet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's decision to discriminate between students living in boarding accommodation and students living in shared housing seems nonsensical. Not many students on Austudy can afford to live alone, and I think this government just wants to punish them for being poor. Housing costs are one of the biggest causes of poverty in Australia, and that is why I find it even further distressing that this government would penny pinch in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a coincidence that I have just come from the launch of a report today entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shutting the door in their faces: barriers to housing experienced by young people</EMPHASIS> by Dr Rodney Fopp. The National Youth Coalition for Housing is having a press conference as we speak. They could not help but point out the ironies in this week's decision on the common youth allowance. The chairperson of that coalition, Maggie Hughes, says&mdash;and I will add the positive bits as well so I am not accused of misrepresenting the position of NYCH:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The common youth allowance went some way in recognising young people's housing affordability issues by extending rent assistance to students living away from home.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Democrats commend that measure. She continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It did not, however, seize the opportunity to remove the unequal discrimination young people face by paying them lower benefits than older recipients. Further, it could result in further disadvantaging young people by refusing to recognise that leaving home is a normal process for those who achieved adulthood by parentally means testing the payments for students aged up to 25 years and the unemployed up to 21 years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So while there are some positive measures that have come out of this week, the negative ones are compounded not only by the measures we see today but, as Senator Carr pointed out, as they are coming in a string of measures designed to attack young people, to reduce the eligibility for Austudy and other
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> measures of financial assistance, especially for students&mdash;look at the recent Abstudy cuts of around $38 million. So it is a string of measures, a pattern, by this government to punish those least able to afford it and, in particular, to punish students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Talking about students, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) only two days ago said that students were somehow the big winners under the common youth allowance proposal. Yet, I cannot see how students have been anything but the biggest losers under the coalition government. Apart from the 2,600 who will lose if this measure is not disallowed by the Senate, 125,000 students lost out under the Austudy changes that were passed in this place last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that young people aged 15 to 24 are on lower incomes. They have high levels of unemployment, housing problems, poverty and homelessness than the rest of the population. Just because we have re-runs of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Brady Bunch</EMPHASIS> does not mean we want to go back, but this government seems to want to return to some halcyon days in the 1950s where some cute and quaint concept of the family ruled, where families were expected to shoulder sole responsibility for themselves and their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1950s were a very different place, and measures such as this overlook the economic and social reality of family life in the 1990s. Families cannot always afford to look after their students or young people in education training. They are not always in a position to do that. As for 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old young unemployed people being expected to be dependent on their families, it is an outrageous decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for Austudy, it remains shamefully below the poverty line. I said that the maximum rate equated to around 60 per cent. If that does not equate with the minister's or the departmental assessment, I would be happy to hear what their estimates are. As for the average rate of Austudy, I think that equates to around 35 per cent of the poverty line, so we are talking meagre benefits, meagre benefits that the coalition, before it got into office, promised it would actually maintain.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4615"> That led many of us, including students, to presume that this meant in its current form or that at least what benefits did exist would be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same week that we have heard announcements about a common youth allowance, I note that the minister for youth affairs has announced a national youth week. I think around $400,000 is to be spent on PR and various promotions, but I do not think that the promotion and PR opportunity of youth week are going to somehow erase the cynicism that young people feel towards this government. The only thing that will do that is the truth. That is, if young people have reason to believe that, when governments or oppositions make promises&mdash;and core promises at that, such as not cutting operating grants, maintaining Austudy or not increasing various fees and charges&mdash;they will stick to those promises. But the coalition continues its zealous drive to push young people back into the parental home, and the common youth allowance is a further indication of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to the glossy brochures and the media fanfare of national youth week. I do not think it is actually starting until 1998. It would have been nice if even a token commitment to young people could have been made this year, but I guess we are going to get all the nasty stuff through in the meantime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Students and the unemployed are not going to be fooled by this. If they are not a full-time student and under 18, if they are students living in share housing or public housing or if they are under 25 years of age, they are probably losing out under this government. Students on the coalition's current rent assistance hit list are not big winners, contrary to the minister's claims. The 2,600 single students living in share accommodation who are set to lose a third of their current rent assistance on 1 July are not going to be fooled, nor are the students in public housing who will lose rent assistance under the proposals in the 1997 federal budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Students should be wary of claims that they will have access to rent assistance under the common youth allowance. The promise of rent assistance for students, I note, is only for
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those who `have to live away from home'. So I look forward to the minister, her department or her representatives in this place, specifically stating what `have to live away from home' means. It sounds somewhat sinister to me, like another way of cracking down and narrowing the eligibility criteria, another way of narrowing access to benefits for young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to know what the coalition means by that phrase. If the track record of this government is anything to go by, students will probably have to become homeless before they can qualify for rent assistance, a point that was made earlier by my colleague Senator Carr. He certainly pointed out the irony of providing rent assistance when, in order to obtain it in the first place, homelessness has to be demonstrated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The standard rate of income for a student over 18 and living away from home remains at a level of around 60 per cent of the poverty line. That is shameful. The news that the common youth allowance will extend the incomprehensible actual means test, which was so mismanaged under Austudy, is not welcome. I find it an extraordinary decision of this government to extend the actual means test, which was the subject of such debacle and such mismanagement earlier this year, when it takes as long as six months to receive a payment under the AMT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This week I got a phone call from a woman who has been in contact with my office who only this week received her first Austudy payment for the year. That is a long time to go without a cent from Austudy&mdash;we are now into June. From January to June this woman has survived without Austudy. So I am frightened that the use once again of the actual means test will leave many young Australians in the lurch; that is, without benefits or with meagre benefits for as long as six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today the Australian Democrats are proud to support the disallowance. I only wish the coalition had taken the opportunity with its announcement of the CYA to really do something about the availability of housing and rent assistance to young Australians&mdash;not this token measure the coalition has put forward.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4616">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, while we are on that topic, the coalition could probably do something about analysing the age of independence for students under the current scheme of Austudy. One of the greatest barriers to participation and to obtaining financial assistance for most students and young people wishing to study is the fact that the age for the independent rate is set at 25&mdash;one of the most regressive measures introduced by this government and one that the Democrats oppose and will continue to fight against. I do not understand how you can define students as winning under this government or under the last week's proposals when they are faced with those kinds of financial and psychological barriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that this government has eroded consistently the benefits available to students and young people. If they vote against the disallowance today then they are set to do it again. There is no doubt that the key to ensuring access and equity in terms of participation in education at whatever level&mdash;primary, secondary, higher education or tertiary training&mdash;is through an appropriate scheme of student financial assistance. Instead, we are seeing governments go the other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do acknowledge Senator Tierney's earlier interjections while Senator Carr was speaking that, in may respects, the former government was not much better. They were involved in reports, they were involved in committees&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats have been fighting this cause for a long time. Back in the days of TEAS we were arguing that there should be parity between unemployment benefits and student financial assistance payments. You have no gripe there from the Democrats; we are very happy to see parity achieved. However, we want to see meaningful, livable incomes provided. There is no point in providing payments for people if they do not even meet or go some way towards meeting poverty line levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we would dearly love to see is not only realistic eligibility criteria for these schemes, and that includes a realistic assessment of and understanding of what is an adult and what are adult expenses, but also accessible and appropriate levels of income&mdash;not these meagre, penny&hyphen;pinching schemes and amounts that are made available to young Australians and students. Students deserve, in terms of financial assistance, livable income levels that not only enable them to pay for the necessities of life such as shelter and food&mdash;and shelter is what we are talking about today; that is, ensuring that students who are living in shared accommodation are not deprived of assistance or do not have their rent assistance cut by a third&mdash;but also for the purchase of things such as study materials, books and a range of other incidentals and costs incurred as a result of choosing to study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand from yesterday's rhetoric, that is what this government says it is about. It wants to provide incentives for young people to be involved in education and training. So why, when you use the word `incentive', do you introduce fees and charges that are up front and full cost? Why do you hike up HECS? Why have you introduced a three&hyphen;tier system of HECS? Why do you debate or even consider the possibility of a HECS structured fee system for TAFE? Or why do you not do something about current up&hyphen;front and other charges available in the TAFE and vocational education arena? Why make student financial assistance so poor, so meagre that students are not sure that they can survive on those benefits let alone take into account the moneys that they need to finance
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4617"> their education, study materials, books, et cetera?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are really keen on incentives, why not do something about it? You can start today. The minister's representative and his colleagues could start today by supporting this disallowance, putting their votes where their mouths are and providing an incentive, meagre as it is, by voting not to reduce by a third the amount of rent assistance available to those students in shared accommodation. If you need any other rationale apart from that being provided today, I strongly urge members to get a copy of this report by Dr Rodney Fopp, which outlines painfully and clearly the hardships that young people face in accessing housing in the private and also the public rental markets.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am debating the disallowance motion from the ALP in relation to Austudy regulations which reduce rental assistance for singles sharing accommodation. This is a budget 1996&hyphen;97 measure. At the moment, rental assistance is only payable to homeless Austudy students, although we acknowledge that the youth allowance changes will pay rent assistance to more students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rent assistance is currently payable to around 2,500 homeless students on Austudy. If they are single, they normally get a maximum rate of $37.30 per week. The government wants to reduce that by one third, to $24.90 per week for those who share accommodation. The Greens are fundamentally opposed to the assumptions behind this measure. Students do not necessarily cut costs
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> if they share. That is a very middle&hyphen;class notion. This is a question of economic survival. It is not as if poorer students who would be eligible for Austudy&mdash;and we are talking about homeless students here&mdash;have the option to live by themselves and suffer the costs. This is simply a crass attempt by the government to cut costs and steal from the poor once again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also wants to nip this reduction in rent assistance in the bud because it has given rent assistance to 70,000 other students under the youth allowance. That is a sweetener, giving assistance to more students while cutting off some 60,000 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old unemployed young people, leaving them with no income whatsoever if they are not in education or training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens oppose the reduction of rent assistance to all eligible students, and to homeless students in particular. For the past four years I have been calling for rent assistance for all Austudy recipients. Just to live near the universities and get to campus&mdash;especially in Sydney and Melbourne&mdash;students have to pay very high rents. Additionally, we believe the youth allowance should provide a rent assistance component. This should be accompanied by a restoration of benefits to all 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, whether or not they are studying. Not to do this is to abrogate social responsibility, create a multitude of social problems and discriminate against young people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the 1996 budget, this government announced changes to the DSS rent assistance provisions. What we are doing today is extending those in an equitable way to include students who are currently receiving Austudy. Under our new youth allowance arrangements&mdash;starting from 1 July 1998&mdash;students on Austudy will come under the same sorts of provisions. We believe this is equitable and, indeed, much better treatment, particularly for the group who were students under the previous Austudy arrangements. I was pleased that Senator Stott Despoja was at least gracious enough to acknowledge some
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4618"> of the positive aspects of these youth allowance arrangements, including the fact that a vast number of students are going to benefit who did not previously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a budget savings measure. It is actually costing the government more money. We are prepared to put more money into this, because we have seen the inequitable position of students who were on Austudy under the previous Labor government. If those students decided to try to improve themselves by education&mdash;and possibly came off unemployment benefits to study&mdash;they had this massive disincentive. They lost benefits if they moved to study. They might or might not have got Austudy but, even if their support income levels were low enough for them to get Austudy, two things happened. Firstly, they were paid at a lower rate compared to those on unemployment benefit and, secondly, they did not get any housing assistance at all. Senator Carr says this is a mean measure. What could be meaner than those students not being able to get any assistance at all? That was precisely the situation during 13 years of Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training brought in a report which pointed this out and recommended things along the lines of a common youth allowance and the removal of disincentives in the system. At that stage, students had an incentive to move out of study and into unemployment, and we had evidence right around Australia of a great number of students doing exactly that. As students, they could not hack it financially. They found that, if they moved to unemployment and did nothing, they might be able to survive&mdash;they got a higher benefit and rent assistance, but they were not studying. We were putting those people back into the poverty trap, and that is what we are reversing with this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very curious that Senator Carr is moving a disallowance motion now.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Carr, you must stop fibbing in this place. If you look at the measure you will find that it is not a budget saving measure. It is actually a measure where we are spending more money. Where are we spending it? We are spending it on the students who are now going to be treated the same as people on unemployment benefits. Not only are we putting these people in a much better situation financially, but I will give Senator Carr the key point&mdash;something that his government could never do. We have put incentive into the system for people to move off unemployment into study. All the research shows&mdash;if Senator Carr has a look at it&mdash;is that, if you study and gain a qualification, you are three times as likely to get a job. That is what this government is on about and that is what this measure is on about. For that reason I would urge the Senate to defeat this disallowance motion.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I begin by saying that it is customary on these measures to actually have a minister to deal with the particular issue before the Senate. While it might strictly be within the standing orders for Senator Tierney to put the government's view, it is not consistent with the normal proprieties of this place. I might suggest that it demonstrates the contempt with which the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) treats this chamber. It is quite apparent that this government has no compunction, no problem at all about saying whatever it likes no matter what actually is the case or what measures are actually being introduced. The government will say or do anything when it comes to trying to win support for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I suggest to Senator Tierney that we are in fact talking about regulations that go to the issues as outlined in budget measure No. 55 in last year's budget. You are in fact discussing the wrong issue. When you are
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4620"> talking about the youth allowance, you address all your remarks to the youth allowance as it will apply next year. These regulations go to the questions as outlined in budget measure 55 from last year's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fundamentally, I might suggest to Senator Tierney that Senator Vanstone might well have been better served if she had actually done this job herself and not left him to do it, because he cannot even follow the brief. I would have thought that with the amount of interest he has in education he could at least follow the brief and get the right measure. He is discussing the wrong measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the philosophical questions, this government says it is about family values. This government says it is about providing additional social support to families to make sure that they look after their own needs. It privatises social security in this manner. This government in fact abandons families and individuals in real need. This is a government that is founded upon the fundamental hypocritical proposition that everyone ought to look after themselves, no matter how badly they are in need of support from the community at large. If someone is in need, it says that is their problem. And it says that it is a compassionate and Christian government!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth, of course, is somewhat different from that. What you see in a whole series of measures introduced by this government is that they are about making it more difficult for people in need, making it more difficult for families to survive as a result of actions taken by this government. A whole series of charges have been introduced in child care, in education, in health care and in pharmaceutical benefits&mdash;right across the board they take away the capacity of families to help their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not talking about a group of people that are well off. We are talking about 2,600 people that are hard up against it, some of the most disadvantaged people in this country&mdash;some 1,400 females and 1,200 males, according to the department's own advice to me at estimates. We are talking about people that are homeless. We are talking about people that are the most disadvantaged in our society.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We are not talking about the sons and daughters of millionaires.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This miserable, mean&hyphen;spirited, pathetic defence that we have just heard highlights just how nasty this action is. A pathetic effort is being made here to try to pull the wool over the eyes of the Senate. What is being attempted here is to target 2,600 people and set the precedent which will of course apply to many tens of thousands of people in future years. It is a pathetic effort by you, Senator Tierney, to not even get the right measure when you do it. I would have thought you could at least get the right measure. We are talking about measures to reduce assistance from, currently, $37 to $24. As I say, it is specifically aimed at 2,600 people most directly in need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I want to emphasise is that there are special circumstances for students as a result of the particular arrangements that have to be made for them. To have reasonable access to universities or TAFEs, students often find it necessary&mdash;not an option, but necessary&mdash;to live in inner&hyphen;city, high rent areas and to share accommodation to reduce costs. This government is specifically aiming its measures at penalising those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Tierney talks about equity. But he does not talk about fairness and he does not talk about justice. He certainly is quite prepared to use the usual tory double speak when it comes to explaining what is a vicious measure aimed at hurting people rather than providing them with assistance. It might well be equitable to treat all people harshly.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="STOTT DESPOJA" NAMEID="3I6">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Equally badly.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AW5">Senator CARR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Equally badly, as my colleague points out. It is not necessarily just and it certainly is not fair. What this measure is aimed at is inflicting greater pain and suffering on Australian families. Senator Tierney likes to have a crack at the Labor Party. I suppose that is what he is paid to do and I cannot begrudge him that opportunity. I have been known to have had the odd shot at him from time to time. But what he ought to be straight about is that the Australian Labor Party oversaw a 164 per cent increase in student assistance in its term in office. In its last year of office, half a million students were assisted at the cost of $1.6 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4621">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is somewhat disingenuous of him to suggest that students were not able to get rent assistance under the Labor government. As I say, budget measure 55 reduced that assistance introduced by the Labor government. This government have cut half a billion dollars out of student assistance, and now they are trying to claim credit for an extension on the rent assistance measures to some students in the future. We have yet to hear precisely how they intend to do that. They said that in the future they are going to spend another $25 million. They have already taken $500 million away from those particular people to do that. So, as Senator Stott Despoja has rightly pointed out, before that cut is introduced they are reducing the maximum entitlement to students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Tierney talked about four students sharing accommodation and each having to pay only a quarter of the full rent. But the question is not whether they pay a quarter, or a half, or an eighth or any other number. The question is the net amount that is paid as a result of the circumstances in which the students are forced to live, the special circumstances that I speak of. In this particular measure, no matter which way you look at it, there is a requirement to meet a threshold level of rent before the assistance cuts in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Senator, quite clearly you are disingenuous. I can say that most charitably. You are disingenuous. This is a measure which cuts in in order to assist, hopefully, students who genuinely need it. Surely, there could be no argument about the genuineness of the need. It is a measure that you would think would be aimed at helping such disadvantaged persons achieve success at university, at TAFE and at school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Tierney tries to have the Senate believe that there is not a threshold: `The three&hyphen;quarters of what is being paid by way of rent is paid to the student in the form of rent assistance'&mdash;which is itself subject to a ceiling; he forgets to point that out. We are not talking about people that are enjoying some sort of windfall. We are talking about people who genuinely need the support of this parliament to provide them with the necessary
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> resources to assist them in securing some success through the education system. We are  talking about people who are paying out more than that threshold amount of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not about a windfall gain, and it is an extraordinary proposition quite in keeping with what I say is the dishonesty of this government when it comes to addressing issues in terms of genuinely assisting families in need. It has been suggested that, if the state provides support, it somehow or other can be at the expense of the rest of the community. That is not the case. We are not providing support here to the sons and daughters of millionaires. We are providing support, as we should and did under the old measure, to people who genuinely need it. We ought to be talking about providing appropriate assistance that meets the circumstances of the 1990s. As Senator Stott Despoja pointed out, it is inappropriate to try to dwell upon some illusion of what family life was like in some distant golden age. We should be talking objectively about the real circumstances in which people find themselves today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are serious about helping disadvantaged people to enjoy the benefits of education, you will ensure that the means to assist them are available. This is not a huge measure in itself. My recollection is that we are talking about the provision of $37 a fortnight&mdash;an extraordinarily small amount of money. If you are genuinely talking about equity rather than lowering standards, and if you are genuinely talking about fairness and justice, you will support this disallowance motion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the government for the change as far as the Australian National Railways Commission Sale Bill 1997, the bill on privatising rail, is concerned. It is a very important matter for Tasmania, where the whole rail system is in enormous contention at the moment. The legislation came to the Senate just this morning. There are 44 pages of it. I am in discussion with a wide range of community groups in Tasmania. I will be meeting unions at a national level this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As you well know, Mr Acting Deputy President, the cut&hyphen;off motion is designed to ensure that opposition parties have sufficient time to properly examine proposed legislation before it is debated, as we do not have extensive departments and resources to consider legislation that is rushed through. In this instance the Senate committee has reviewed the matter of rail in broad terms and therefore we have had an opportunity to examine it. We always like to resist cut&hyphen;off motions if we can because we believe that thoroughly examining legislation is one of the fundamental roles of the Senate. In this particular case, however, the Democrats will support the government in allowing this bill to come on for debate this session. This is because we believe that it is important that discussions start now to ensure that the matter is resolved as quickly as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we would like to put on the record just how badly the government has managed this whole affair. The government announced in November 1996&mdash;that is, seven months ago&mdash;that it wanted to sell AN by 1 July this year, but they did not bother to introduce legislation into the House of Representatives until only a few weeks ago, on 14 May 1997. Why did they wait so long? Why didn't they table the bill in the previous session? It is what any sensible and reasonable minister should have done, and I believe the Senate should condemn the minister for the way in which he has managed this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only did it not occur to the minister to do this but the government only recently became aware that complementary legislation needs to be passed by the South Australian parliament, and that legislation has not yet been tabled. That is another reason why we need to accede to the minister's request, because the South Australian parliament are waiting for us on this issue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has mismanaged the sale process. Expressions of interest in the purchase of AN were called for in the national print media on 19 March 1997 and had to be  lodged by mid&hyphen;April. This left little time for prospective buyers to prepare suitably detailed and thought&hyphen;through submissions. Final offers had to be lodged by early June, giving selected bidders only a few weeks to work on their submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One bidder has been reported as saying that it was ridiculous to ask bidders to prepare adequate documentation in such a short space of time. Another has questioned why the sale is being rushed when a new owner would not be operating on 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I appreciate the system and I know that you are acting as a messenger in bringing this before the Senate and asking for our permission, but we would like to convey to you, from our side of the chamber, our disquiet with the manner and the process that is being adopted by the minister responsible.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment seeks to try, as near as practicable, to ensure that 50 per cent of candidates in group voting tickets are women. This is always a difficult issue. I have not come across any parliamentarian who does not agree that the parliament should in fact be fully represented in the question of gender. But the electoral process, I am afraid, keeps delivering us a result which is not equivalent. What is under scrutiny, as a consequence of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4625"> that, is the manner in which the major parties preselect women for winnable seats. It is to the credit of the Liberal Party that in the current parliament they have markedly improved the gender representation both in the lower house and in the Senate. We still have some way to go, but you are certainly making some progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe that, given the inequality of representation of women in parliament and in positions of power generally, women should be given encouragement to actively participate in this debate. Senators would be aware, as I am, of the historical situation whereby our original convention that set up the Federation actually had no women at all. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has promised to ensure a proper balance between men and women at the convention, and Senator Minchin has indicated his own preference for 50:50 representation in terms of the appointed delegates. We thank you for that commitment and we look forward to it being realised in fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think we need to go further and legislate in this convention to ensure that women candidates are given appropriate exposure. There were no women at the Australasian federal conventions in the late 19th century. Women's representation in parliaments across Australia is an average of 20 per cent, which is regarded as pretty pathetic by all those with an eye both to what is moral and what is right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats do not support quotas. We do not use quotas in our own party. We clearly have not needed them. We would not support the implementation of quotas in this situation. But we do believe that requiring those setting up group voting tickets in the election to have half their candidates as women is one way to address gender inequality. I am aware that, during the second reading debate, persons such as Senator Neal did attack the intention that we are putting up and indicated that there is nothing to stop groups putting women at the bottom of the ticket in unwinnable positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that is possible but I happen to be a co&hyphen;patron of the Australian Republican
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Movement, along with Senator Eggleston and Senator Cook in Western Australia, and I happen to know that the ARM people will not be putting women in unwinnable positions  and do not intend to allow that to happen. While Senator Neal, in theory may have a point, I am hopeful that she is wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could have advocated a quota. It is very difficult for the Democrats to do that in view of our own policy and our own attitude. Our objective in moving this amendment is not to use women but to respond to the very strong appeal that we have had from women in our constituency and from women outside our constituency&mdash;from all parties, incidentally&mdash;and from organisations such as the WEL organisation, the Women's Electoral Lobby.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would like cross&hyphen;party support for this motion. There are some people who deliberately vote for women when and if they appear. We think they should be satisfied in the process. The Labor Party clearly have problems with the issue as outlined by Senator Neal, but I regret&mdash;and you would be aware of it, Senator Bolkus&mdash;that the ALP's record on the advancement of women in your party has been under strong attack. It is not too late to start to redress an unnecessary problem you have as a result of your history of not advancing women sufficiently in the electoral context. I would not like to think that the strains of chauvinism are still alive in the breast of the Labor Party. With those words, I would like to commend our amendment to the Senate. I will be interested in hearing the response to it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not disagree with the aspiration of this proposal by the Australian Democrats. It is one that we are implementing both within the party and also quite rigidly in our participation in the tickets that will be put forward for this convention. In our involvement with the Republican Movement and with other parties, we are ensuring that there will be gender equality in the winnable positions to the extent that we can define such and, in that way, we will deliver on this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Murray himself would acknowledge that this issue of representation should be broader than just women. We need
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4626"> to find ways of including and reflecting the diversity of our society in any representative body that is elected, and that is another principle that we will be looking at both in terms of indigenous Australians and also the multicultural diversity of our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular Democrat amendment does not in a practical way achieve that. I know the motivation and the aspiration may be there, but we all know that, under the particular proposal, if a team of 12 chose to put six females on the bottom half of their ticket, they would still satisfy the requirements of the Democrat amendment. We share with you the aspiration. We cannot see that your amendment will deliver the outcome you want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do think, in terms of representation, there should be a reflection of greater diversity. As I said yesterday, our amendment No. 82 is one that we believe is probably about as far as a parliament can go in terms of laying down a framework in this particular context, and that is the amendment that does talk about the need for the convention to be fully representative of the diverse experiences, backgrounds, views, beliefs and aspirations of the Australian people. We do reflect on the fact that the constitutional conventions of a hundred years ago were composed entirely of male delegates and we do say that we would wish that all groupings in this particular context would provide for fair but, more importantly, equal representation of women. I hope that you will be supporting our preamble to the bill later on. I also ask you to note that, though you may want something more, your amendment does not really deliver that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wine Export Charge Bill 1997 and the Wine Export Charge (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997 seek to impose an industry levy on the wine industry. The purpose of the levy is to pay for the generic Australian wine promotion programs that support exports of Australian wine. Of course, there are already levies being charged on the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for urgency is that the government does not see fit to provide transitional funding to cover costs while this bill is being debated, so we will find it here in non-controversial legislation the second last week for passage prior to its intended starting date. We have not had it for a long time but we have been required to deal with it very quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been told that the lack of the levy could cost the wine industry $50,000 per month to keep their infrastructure intact. The resources of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation are now exhausted to an extent that they will have to start borrowing to avoid losing what they have already done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we have agreed to expedite the legislation at the urging of many in the industry, it is not a non-controversial bill. That there should be a levy is not controversial. That it should be industry funded is not controversial. The controversy lies in the collection mechanism and, to some extent, the benefits derived by various classes of wine producer. The proposed collection mechanism is to place a levy on the value of the wine exported. This means that producers of more expensive wines will pay more per bottle
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4628"> exported regardless of how much wine they export, but of course it is per bottle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wine export promotion is fundamentally based on promoting the high quality of Australian wines. We have received substantial recognition for the quality of our premium wines. Not only the quality but also the diversity of premium wines builds our image as a producer of high quality wine. By enhancing the reputation of Australia as a wine producer, the identity as a producer of good wines spills over and allows increased exports of less expensive, lesser quality wines and bulk wines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since it is the premium, high quality wines that create the international identity that allows increased exports of all wine, it seems stupid to have a collection mechanism which is, in this sense, price based creating a disincentive for premium wines and an incentive for cheaper and bulk packed wines. A collection mechanism levied on a quantitative basis would be more beneficial for just the sorts of wines we are trying to promote overseas&mdash;the premium wines that build our reputation as a wine exporting nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The large wineries produce both premium wines and cheaper high volume wines. Small wineries produce almost exclusively premium wines. The skew in the levy favouring cheap wine is, therefore, a skew towards the big wine makers who also tend to dominate the various industry bodies. I am particularly aware of this skew since WA has almost no really large wine makers. Nearly all of our state industry falls in the category of small and medium producers. Their plight becomes more evident for this reason. I really am here speaking for small premium wine producers all over Australia&mdash;and there are a disproportionately high number of producers in my own home state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dissatisfaction over this ad valorem tax comes on top of the general dissatisfaction with the outcome of the wholesale sales tax issue from 1993. Wholesale sales tax is, of course, a price based tax which penalises higher priced wines. In the wine industry, the entire tax is price based, while in the other alcoholic beverages industry it is partially
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> price based and partially based on alcohol content&mdash;a volume based measure. The smaller wineries felt that the interests of bulk suppliers of cheap wines were the winners of the 1993 debate, and calls for shifts to a volume basis were ignored in favour of the big players.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The collection mechanism for this levy is further problematic because there is a stepped arrangement. As the amount exported increases, the levy rate decreases. For the first $10 million worth of wine exported, the levy is $250 per million dollars exported. It drops to $200 per million dollars on 1 July next year. But for those exporting over $10 million of wine, the levy is $150 per million and that will drop to $100 per million next year. They have to pay the levy on the first $10 million at the same rate as the small exporters, but then the lower rate kicks in, giving them an overall lower rate of levy&mdash;one which gets effectively lower as the volume decreases. When the export volume reaches $50 million worth of exports, the levy drops to $50 per million dollars exported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This system further favours the big players who are already favoured because they are the exporters of the cheaper, low cost, high volume cask wines. It allows distortions that mean some small winemaking organisations believe the three largest wine companies, who account for roughly two-thirds, or 66 per cent, to three-quarters, or 75 per cent, of exports, will only pay approximately 20 per cent of the total levy between them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The collection mechanism is, therefore, of concern to the smaller wineries. The fact that they may only be paying $150 because their exports are only worth $&half; million does not make the situation more equitable, just a little less painful. The levy is not meant to be a big tax. It is set up by the industry as a levy the industry feels happy with. The contributions of each small winery may seem minor, but in aggregate they are going to pay a disproportionate bulk of the levy. I will ask, therefore, that the minister give an undertaking, in the next review of this levy, to pay special attention to the equity of value based levies and consider volume based levies as an alternative
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4629"> or perhaps consider some sort of mixture of the two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue of concern to many of the small and medium wineries I have spoken to relates to the value of the services the levy funds. Many of the medium wineries believe they get little or no value and that the major beneficiaries are the big players. We know the big players also provide a lot of their own promotions. But they also benefit, I must say. Even if they are promoting the cheaper wines, they benefit from the prizes and the promotion that is done by the premium, low volume, high value wineries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fairness, I have also heard that some of the small wineries who are just trying to enter do feel the programs have been a positive benefit to them. But many of the established small and medium wineries are very active in promoting their own product. It was notable that as I called around recently nearly all the owners and senior managers of the wineries were overseas directly promoting their wines at various shows. The premium wineries do a lot of work that benefits all Australian wine exports at their own cost. Moreover, a number of the premium wineries expressed the opinion that their own work has resulted in their recognition and the establishment of growing niche markets for exports&mdash;and this has nothing to do with the promotion by the Wine and Brandy Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One medium winery in WA who exports several million dollars of wine each year expressed the view that, as a company, they get no benefit from the levy. They expressed their resentment of the injustice of the collection mechanism but in the end reluctantly agreed that they should probably support this levy going through. They did so on the basis that the promotion efforts, while of no benefit to them as a business, were of benefit to the industry and should be supported. We recognise this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found this attitude expressed over and over again. Very few small and medium wineries in WA seemed happy with the scheme&mdash;either its collection mechanism or its benefits to their business&mdash;and felt resentment at the flow of benefits to the bigger wineries.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They did, in spite of this, feel it would be better to have the promotion schemes than to let them collapse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will therefore ask the minister, in the interest of justice, to ensure that the promotion schemes this levy will fund will substantially benefit the small and medium producers of premium wines. These are the people who will pay a disproportionate amount of the  levy. These are the people on whose reputation, as makers of quality wines, our wines will rest. These are the people active in promoting their own products as exports at their own expense and this creates benefits for the entire sector. The promotion scheme should provide substantial benefits for all these people.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 is an omnibus taxation bill covering a wide area. Many of the measures in the bill are of an anti&hyphen;avoidance nature, specifically: the tightening of rules concerning capital losses to ensure no abuse can occur
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4631"> where the underlying beneficial ownership of the company group has changed; limiting withholding tax avoidance, including by broadening the general anti&hyphen;avoidance provisions, part 4A, to cover arrangements to avoid withholding tax; denying dual resident companies the benefits that they may inappropriately receive through being Australian resident companies; and, aligning the treatment of the leasing of luxury cars with the restricted depreciation regime applying to luxury cars. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These anti&hyphen;avoidance matters are all supported by Labor. Indeed, some of the issues dealt with in this legislation were announced by Labor in the last election campaign and stolen by the government&mdash;for example, the dual resident company provision. There is still much legislative and compliance tightening that needs to be achieved to ensure that the loopholes which higher income earners are taking unfair advantage of, are closed in order to provide the Australian government with its fair share of tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The repair of the tax base, the closing of loopholes and the pursuit of tax cheats is the kind of tax reform that should be undertaken by the government. Ordinary families are paying their fair share of tax and they should not be threatened by the introduction of a GST or other like new tax changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two other significant matters in the bill to which I will address some specific remarks: the reforms of the withholding tax provisions and the alteration of the standardised contribution rates for employer superannuation contributions. In regard to the withholding tax, the restructuring of the withholding tax exemption provisions provided for in this bill will allow Australian small businesses, home buyers and consumers to benefit from lower interest rates overseas. The exemptions from interest withholding tax which now apply for business funds are to be extended to other areas such as home mortgage finance and consumer finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes will have the effect of lowering the costs of accessing offshore finance for non&hyphen;business purposes. This should directly benefit lenders accessing offshore finance and also place further pres
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sure on the margins of local lenders ensuring an ongoing benefit to all borrowers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor is a strong supporter of this measure, not because we agree automatically with government policies but rather because this legislation is enacting a Labor policy initiative. This measure was announced by Labor in the innovations statement of December 1995. Subsequently, in June 1995, the Treasurer, acknowledging Labor's position, proceeded with development of this proposal. An opportunity has also been taken to reform the  anti&hyphen;avoidance tax regime concerning bearer debentures. Again, Labor does not oppose this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to superannuation, the bill proposes to remove, from 1997&hyphen;98, the option for employers to make standardised superannuation contributions on behalf of employees. This will generate savings of $35 million in 1997&hyphen;98 and $40 million in 1998&hyphen;99 and later years. It is being done to protect the PAYE tax base. Disproportionate deductions are not allowable for superannuation contributions. These are limited on an age basis which recognises that older employees may have greater needs than younger employees with respect to superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor introduced a simplified administration option for employers with more than 10 employees, whereby a standardised maximum level could be applied to all employees on whose behalf superannuation contributions are made. The bill proposes to eliminate this option for employers. We will not oppose this change but Labor does point out that, as a consequence of this change, the government is consciously imposing a higher compliance cost on small and medium sized businesses and reducing the superannuation benefits to be accrued for some employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to reducing the superannuation benefits accrued for some employees, we do not argue with the fairness of that approach. However, I would point out the double standard we hear, particularly from the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, in this place, and from the government which pretends, and has indeed promised, to reduce red tape and administrative paperwork for small business,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4632"> but is constantly increasing the compliance business on small business. This particular measure will certainly do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Generally, Labor believes this legislation package is appropriate and should be supported. We do so without moving amendment and we agree to a swift passage of the legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is good to get an intelligent question about this again. Intelligent questions seem to be coming from only this side of the chamber, unfortunately. You would think that, with the mess that was left in this area by the previous government, some elements in the Senate would be interested in asking intelligent questions. I suppose that, from the opposition, who are the ones who left the situation in such a mess, you would at least have expected some contrition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They gave us the youth unemployment rates of over 30 per cent. They decimated the apprenticeship system, as we told you yesterday. They had a system whereby the young unemployed were being paid more than their peers who were studying.

Students are already subject to a parental means test. Their benefits are going up and the parental means test ceiling is going up from $37,000 to $41,000 and higher for the bigger families. Senator Kernot also said that a family earning $35,000 a year with a 16&hyphen;year&hyphen;old at home would get an allowance of $10 a week. Again, that is completely false.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Senator Parer. The Federation of Automotive Product Manufacturers has released details showing a significant rise in the value of automotive exports resulting in Australian components now being used in a surprisingly wide range of cars around the world.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank Senator Ferguson very much for that question. Coming from South Australia, he has a keen interest in the automotive industry. Yes, I am aware of recent reports that have shown that export earnings for the industry are forecast to grow to approximately $6 billion by the year 2005. Overall, automotive exports now represent four per cent of manufacturing exports and two per cent of total Australian exports. The forecast growth up to 2005 of just over $2 billion continues the strong growth trend we have seen to date and represents a threefold increase in the 1996 export figures. It demonstrates a very strong commitment within the automotive industry to develop export markets and capture export opportunities. I would also like to note that, according to a recent statement made by the Federation of Automotive Product Manufacturers:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's recently announced auto industry policy has given the green light for the export of 180,000 cars by the year 2005 with matching component exports expected to reach $3 billion. In total, automotive exports will amount to as much as $8 billion per year by the middle of the next decade.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In its automotive decision announced on 5 June, the government announced the framework for an automotive trade development strategy. Key initiatives of the strategy include the establishment of a new automotive trade council, the appointment of a specialist trade access negotiator, a market development package worth $20 million over four years and the development of a WTO consistent program to replace the current export facilitation scheme when it expires in the year 2000.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government reached its decision on the new policy arrangements for the car industry we did so with two objectives in mind. Firstly, we addressed the need to keep the decision consistent with the APEC commitments and, secondly, we addressed the need to secure the next round of industry investment. The decision announced by the Prime Minister earlier this month is wholly consistent with both of these objectives. It puts in place a mechanism which reduces tariffs by more than 50 per cent over the next eight years and with the full support of the industry it creates certainty in the investment environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the government's commitment to continuing reform I am confident the Australian car industry will be well placed to lead the region into the next century. Unlike the  opposition, we did not flip&hyphen;flop our way to a great mistake. We developed a pragmatic approach which secures the best of both worlds. Tariff reform and securing industry investment are not inconsistent goals. This decision clearly shows that the government's industry policy is based on a clear understanding of what Australian industry needs in the run&hyphen;up to the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting what Labor did during its period in government. In 1984, shortly before Labor came into office, car production in Australia stood at 370,000 units. When it left in 1996 production was 314,000 units. Nissan had closed down production and Australia had lost the capacity to produce small cars such as the Ford Laser. Under Labor, employment in the industry declined from 70,000 to 45,000. What a record&mdash;totally indicative of 13 years of Labor mismanagement.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, as you know, the Howard government has a very strong record on nature conservation, and it made further decisions last weekend with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Council which will, we believe, be a turning point for the dugong in the southern Great Barrier Reef region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have previously informed the Senate of the alarming decline in dugong numbers in  the southern Great Barrier Reef region. This animal is one of the values for which the Great Barrier Reef was listed under the world heritage convention. We therefore have a responsibility to protect the dugong, yet numbers have fallen between 50 and 80 per cent over the last decade. Unlike the ALP, which was of course in government during that period, the Howard government is committed to taking action to rescue the dugong. While there are several threats to its survival, the greatest threat appears to be associated with the use of mesh nets in commercial fishing operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate will recall that I took decisive action last year to protect the dugong by banning mesh netting in Shoalwater Bay, which has one of the healthiest dugong populations in the region. Last weekend the Great Barrier Reef Marine Council agreed that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4643"> further action had to be taken. The council agreed that mesh netting must be banned in other dugong sanctuaries. The ministerial council also agreed that, where individual fishermen are affected by closures, compensation should be considered. The decision was taken after extensive consultation and careful consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ministerial council will meet again in two months to finalise the boundaries of the areas in which mesh netting is to be banned and the appropriate industry adjustment compensation mechanism. The ministerial council will also consider proposals for further action on other threats to the dugong, including measures to protect seagrasses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the ALP, this government will work cooperatively with the states and with other stakeholders, and that is exactly what we are doing in this instance. We recognise that most fishermen wish to protect the dugong&mdash;in fact, I acknowledge the efforts of the fishing industry to develop its own strategy. However, scientific evidence indicated that, if we were to protect the animal, the only option available to us in these very specific areas is to ban the mesh nets. We will work through the adjustment and compensation issues with the industry over the next couple of months in an open and transparent way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The action we have taken to protect the dugong has been welcomed by the conservation movement. The Queensland Conservation Council has stated:</PARA>

But, to the extent that they are regular fishermen who have been earning a living from those gill nets, we believe the public should pay compensation to them because the decision that is being taken is to protect those values for the benefit of the whole community.

Nevertheless, this issue was canvassed somewhat extensively at estimates, and I would have thought the opposition could not milk another single tear out it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is that the funding for something like 11 centres around Australia is now being focused on 200 centres around Australia&mdash;much more representative of the nation. I think the 10 or 11 family resource centres were in virtually the eastern states of Australia. Western Australia, Tasmania and I think the ACT as well did not have any of these centres, which were basically the middlemen in putting services available in the community together with people who may need the services. These centres had a coordinating role, if you like, but were not a provider of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what the government has decided to do is in fact to use a substantial part of that money in providing help to 200 youth centres around the country which may have adolescents who need assistance or parents who need assistance with their adolescents. That is an important issue when we all recognise that adolescence is a time when young people and their parents often do not see eye to eye. Where there is a need for field officers, for instance, to help parents and young people work together to achieve reconciliation, that is obviously a very worthwhile family initiative. In difficult economic times, this government has decided that it is better to make sure that that assistance goes to 200 places in Australia, a lot of them in rural and regional Australia. Most of them were getting no assistance whatsoever from the family resource centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was canvassed, as I say, pretty widely in the  estimates. I am very glad to have the opportunity to give the whole of the Senate the benefit of that information, which I think is a very worthwhile change of direction.</PARA></ANSWER>

I do not know how many young Australians will continue to stay in school or who, instead of staying in school, will move from school to some sort of vocational training.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if that is the consequence, every one that you add up that does that we are very happy about, because every child that stays longer at school or goes into vocational training has a much better chance of a much less bleak future than they would have if they were on the dole&mdash;a much better chance of a less bleak future.

The comments of Senators Woodley, Margetts and Kernot in that respect are, in my view, pretty disgraceful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is putting an additional $19 million into a youth suicide prevention strategy. When you add that to the $13 million that was already there from the previous government&mdash;they also acknowledged it as a problem&mdash;you come up with a $31 million strategy seeking to address five key aspects: supporting research into the complex causes of youth suicide; increasing access to early intervention programs for parents; increasing access to counselling and telephone support; placing increased emphasis on the needs of families and young people in rural areas; and, last but certainly not least, training professionals and improving the reporting of suicide by the media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I very much hope, Senator, that the remarks made by your colleagues and Senator Margetts, in order to get themselves a headline, associating themselves with youth suicide, do not in fact work on some autocue basis.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), to a question without notice asked by Senator Childs today, relating to apprenticeships.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As a tradesman, I asked a question about apprentices from Qantas, who are members of my union, the AMWU. The problems that they face are typical of the problems that young people, apprentices and trainees face in this country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has flown away from his responsibility to solve the problems of young people&mdash;of apprentices and trainees. He has left the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) here today to answer questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked a question about the decline in apprenticeship positions by 1,000 last year, and the minister does not know about it. Even though there was an article on this in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph </EMPHASIS>at the beginning of this week, this minister did not know about it. She is going to get an answer, like the other answers she has been going to get. She has a record of being the second slowest minister in a very slow ministry. She cannot answer questions relating to areas with which she is directly involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The case of the 53 Qantas apprentices is a symptom of the problems that we have in this country at the present time. The minister is capable of quoting her junior minister in the gobbledegook we heard today but she is not capable of answering a specific question when she is the minister who has responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a mean spirit in the land. The mean spirit starts with the Prime Minister and his ministers, and it is beginning to permeate society. Already, some of the largest corporations are infected. You see it in what Qantas has done with its apprentices. At Newcastle in my state of New South Wales, BHP, one of the largest companies in Australia, is being irresponsible in threatening employment. This is happening at a time when the Prime Minister, who also comes from my state, is leading us overseas on a cricketing tour. Unemployment has gone up in New South Wales from 7.7 per cent at the time of the last election to 8.3 per cent. That is an example of what is happening in my state, with an absent Prime Minister and with a minister who cannot address the issues that we face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The significance of the question I asked is that the minister does not know the information that was given by her officers at the estimates committee. The figures were given by her officers at meetings at which she was sitting. She just is not in touch. She was
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4647"> sitting at the meetings but she does not know the figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, she has left the chamber. I hope she is looking up the estimates records that will show that the figures which I put in my question to her are based, quite properly, on figures that were divulged by her own officers. Those figures cannot be hidden any longer. This government is betraying young people, betraying the victims of its own policies, and the figures cannot be denied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No amount of bluster can deny this. This minister is very good on bluster. We have just seen her bluster to Senator Stott Despoja. Last month alone 40,300 jobs disappeared: 23,000 of them were full&hyphen;time jobs. Since the coalition's first budget, 57,400 jobs have disappeared&mdash;the result of conscious policies of this government. The government cannot avoid facing up to the fact that, in the very last month of May, the participation rate dropped to 63.2 per cent. It is the lowest rate since November 1994. Bluster is not good enough at question time from Senator Vanstone, the minister.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Childs talks about apprenticeships and traineeships. Isn't it fascinating? Once again he is complaining about what the Liberal coalition government is doing about apprenticeships and traineeships when, under the Labor government, apprenticeships and traineeships fell to their lowest level as a percentage of the work force in three decades&mdash;not just over the last couple of years; it actually fell to the lowest level in three decades. Senator Childs says, `Woe is me. We have a few apprenticeship and traineeship problems in the work force.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If he has identified a few apprenticeships and traineeships in the work force, why didn't he seek to do something about it when he was part of a government that for 13 years presided over the greatest drop in apprenticeships and traineeships in three decades? What has the coalition government done? As the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Minister Kemp, has said, there will be 55,000 new TAFE places in the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> coming year and 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships in the year after.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have a clear program directed at 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships, and yet Senator Childs comes in here and complains about it, having presided over the greatest decline in three decades. Where in the world is the logic of the Labor Party? It completely escapes me to think that this is what they can do every single solitary day after question time, when they have actually created the problem, and they come in and blame the coalition government for resolving the problem. We did not create these problems, but we have certainly undertaken to fix them. And that is the difference between that government for 13 years and this government in 15 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened in the last few days is that the coalition government has actually made a conscious decision to reverse the circumstances that the Labor government put in place, and that is where young people got paid more not to work than to train.

It appears that a couple of forecasts made by Senator Vanstone are in the process of coming true.

The second forecast was that there was no instant fix to the current unemployment in this country. We certainly know the latter is correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is surprising is that the government appears not to care about its unemployment drive to extinction. One asks the question: what are the direct responsibilities of this government? Forty&hyphen;three thousand jobs have been lost in a single month&mdash;23,000 of those jobs full time, with 20,000 part&hyphen;time jobs lost. There are now 242,000, almost one&hyphen;quarter of a million, long&hyphen;term unemployed people in Australia, with few adequate labour market programs&mdash;the highest figure in two years, and 28,000 more since March 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at each of the states one by one, we see that the unemployment rate is up in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> New South Wales to 8.3 per cent, up in Victoria to 9.2 per cent, up in Queensland to 9.7 per cent, up in South Australia to 9.8 per cent and up in Tasmania to 10.4 per cent. Nine-tenths of Australians are living in states of rising unemployment, states of insecurity and states of lost hope. The only healthy state is my own state. The unemployment figures are down there because of lower participation rates. You have driven them out of the work force. That is why the unemployment rate is down there.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a bit disappointed in Senator Childs today because it is not usually his style to take cheap political points and to make the sorts of comments he made about the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) going overseas. When Prime Minister Keating went overseas, you did not hear this side carping about his going away. We did complain when he went away and bucketed Australia from overseas, but we did not complain when he went overseas because it is absolutely vital that our prime ministers of either persuasion go overseas, particularly when a prime minister is going to two countries which are two of our largest trading partners and two of our largest investors. It is important for jobs. Those opposite would not understand that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister going to the cricket is better than the feigned interest that Mr Keating had in the Collingwood football team, flying at taxpayer's expense to Melbourne. I do not think he has been to football again since then. At least the Prime Minister has a genuine and long&hyphen;term interest in cricket, more than the previous Prime Minister had in Collingwood when he travelled to watch a game at taxpayers' expense. You would think that that was all he was going to do, the way you go on. When a cricket team or a sporting  team wins in Australia, confidence goes up in Australia. So it is important for the Prime Minister to show interest in our sports men and women overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me get back to the issue of apprenticeships. Despite the fact that I disagreed with quite a bit of what Senator Kernot said yesterday on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>, at least she had the good grace to actually acknowledge that there were some good parts of this package. There were one or two things she said that I  would take issue with&mdash;she disagrees with us on some things&mdash;but she actually outlined some of the positive points in the package. The Labor Party has not had the good grace to do that on one occasion. There are many points here and, if
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4650"> they would actually look at, address and turn their minds to what we are doing, they would see that we are making improvements on the mess they left traineeships and apprenticeships in, the mess they left the social security system in&mdash;despite the fact that minister after minister kept saying that it was trim, taut and terrific&mdash;the mess they left Austudy in and the disarray and lack of coordination facing young people in finding their way through that maze.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Knowles, when she was addressing the issue, said that, under Labor, apprenticeships, as a proportion of the work force, fell to the lowest level in three decades.

There are many programs being introduced by the coalition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take note of the same matter, and Senator Patterson will be pleased that I am speaking on this matter. The decline in apprentices we are talking about is another example of the government's record across the board on unemployment. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) continues to claim that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4651"> all sorts of his measures will generate jobs, but his credibility is waning under the heavy weight of evidence. Let us look at some of those claims.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He said that the Workplace Relations Act would create jobs. Where are they? He said that the unfair dismissal changes within the Workplace Relations Act would create jobs. Where are they? He said that further unfair dismissal changes, the exemptions for small business, would create jobs. Small business does not seem to agree, if you take comments from the MTAA and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and research such as the Yellow Pages small business report. Now he is saying that tax reform will create jobs. I am sorry, but the line is getting a little too long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now let us look at the real evidence on these issues. In the 15 months since the Howard government took office, the number of people unemployed has risen by 39,000; the unemployment rate has risen from 8.5 per cent to 8.8 per cent; and youth unemployment&mdash;since we are focusing on youth&mdash;has risen from 27.4 per cent to 27.5 per cent. So where is the evidence to support these claims? The government simply has to stop copping out. This is why, as Senator Patterson refers to it, some people seem to be referring to some of the petty issues&mdash;although, I note, she went back to pettiness herself. People are obviously concerned about the fact that the Prime Minister is leaving the country to go to Lord's before he goes to Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is good reason for that sort of concern. The new youth allowance, which he launched just before he left, will not create jobs; it just blames victims&mdash;something this government is getting very good at doing. We have read in the media that the Prime Minister is going to Britain to talk about employment measures. He seems to have forgotten that Tony Blair came to Australia a couple of years ago to look at what we were doing under Working Nation and took with him our training initiatives and labour market programs. But the British do not have a great record on long-term unemployment. We certainly do not want to use it as a model
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> here. It is about the last model we would want to put in place in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us remind the Senate that a year ago this week this government began slashing away at Working Nation programs such as skillshare, which targeted the long-term unemployed. Since the dismantling of these programs, 28,000 more people have joined the long-term unemployed queue. The Howard government's laughable program&mdash;the work for the dole scheme for 10,000 people&mdash;will do nothing for the highest number of long&hyphen;term unemployed in two years. This is no record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude my comments by going back to apprenticeships&mdash;since it was raised by Senator Knowles as being the key point of relevance in this matter. However, she does not seem to understand the difference between apprenticeships and traineeships and perhaps other forms of vocational education when she talks about the 100,000 new TAFE places. What the government is doing in this matter&mdash;and the states have been complaining about it, too&mdash;is shifting responsibility and funding to the states, and this is not a new concept. In fact, 50,000 of those places, which have previously been a matter of Commonwealth responsibility, will become the burden of states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">State governments are upset about this. Conservative state governments are upset about this. The Victorian tertiary education minister, Phil Honeywood has said that `the hypocrisy in this is there for all to see'. The hypocrisy of the government's action in  vocational education and training for young people is there for all to see; the hypocrisy in the government's record on jobs and job creation is there for all to see.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jacinta Collins talks about hypocrisy. Let us have a look at the hypocrisy of opposition members when they start talking about employment records and training records. Let us have a bit of a look at what happened under 13 years of Labor compared to what is happening now as we try to turn this around.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4652">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor had an absolutely shocking record on not only employment but also training. If you have a look at the number of jobs that were lost during the great Keating recession between 1990 and 1993, you will find that the net new jobs over that period from the peak of one boom to the peak of another was about 50,000. In a period of four years that is all we gained in employment under the best part of the Keating years. Yet the people on the other side of the chamber have the hide, given their total failure in this area over 13 years, to come in and talk about employment records.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area where the previous government failed dismally was in training, particularly in the area of apprenticeships. Over Labor's 13 years, the apprenticeship system in this country totally collapsed. What we are now creating in this next budget&mdash;something which Senator Collins very conveniently forgot to talk about but was reminded of by Senator Patterson&mdash;is 100,000 apprenticeship places. This government will be spending $260 million on this area because it has set it as a priority. The areas of vocational education and training are a priority of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last government got it totally wrong. Former Minister Dawkins spent a fair bit of his reign&mdash;a reign of terror, particularly with the universities&mdash;on trying to change the university system, totally confusing it in the process and setting wrong directions by giving a whole series of edicts from on high, particularly relating to amalgamations and central direction. Before he turned his mind to universities, he should have turned it to vocational education and training in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He very belatedly discovered this in about 1992, when, in the desperate dark days of the Keating recession we had to have, the then government finally turned their mind to training with the creation of the Australian National Training Authority, and then a little bit later they started on Working Nation. An enormous amount of money was spent on Working Nation, which had incredibly poor work outcomes and which focused on the long-term unemployed, of whom only 30 per cent got jobs, and the other 70 per cent were
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> picked up off the scrap heap and then dropped back again. There were terrible outcomes for those people, not only in respect of work and income but also in respect of the psychological effects of what happened to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government is about is creating real training and real jobs. That is why the measures for the youth allowance, announced yesterday, are most welcome. What we are going to focus on is young people not just automatically going to get the dole but being put back into training. Why is this the way to go? It is because the statistics have told us about the work outcomes for people who are trained versus those who are not trained: those who are trained are three times more likely to get a proper job. That is why the whole focus of our programs is towards doing that.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is particularly concerned at the amount of the concessional resident subsidy (set at $5 per resident per day). The Committee believes that the subsidy does not provide any real assistance to nursing homes, especially in the not-for-profit sector who cater predominantly for financially disadvantaged people, to maintain and upgrade facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that unless the concessional subsidy is substantially increased it will lead to a two-tired system where financially disadvantaged people will be accommodated in lower standard accommodation with no real prospect of facilities being upgraded in the future.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">COMMONWEALTH VEHICLES (REGISTRATION AND EXEMPTION FROM TAXATION) BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation is one of two bills arising from issues associated with the sale of DASFLEET. The other companion bill is the Commonwealth Motor Vehicles (Liability) Amendment Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the Government announced in 1996 its intention to either sell its vehicle fleet business, DASFLEET, or refinance the vehicles which DASFLEET operates. The Government decided to approach the market for bids based on both sale and refinancing to ensure the best possible outcome for the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government is committed to public sector reform and has sought to identify functions where direct Commonwealth involvement can no longer be justified. In the case of DASFLEET and the other Department of Administrative Services business units currently being offered for sale, the Government has identified areas which do, or could, compete directly with private sector suppliers. It has decided to divest itself of these functions, while at the same time ensuring a fair return to the taxpayer for these quality businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The operation of the Commonwealth motor vehicle fleet has historically been undertaken internally and the origins of DASFLEET can be traced to the Department of Defence in the early 1920s. At that time, the options available to the Commonwealth for the provision of motor vehicles were limited. Today, however, the provision of motor vehicles and fleet management services is undertaken by a dynamic and competitive industry and the case for maintaining a Commonwealth&hyphen;owned vehicle fleet is no longer compelling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Vehicles (Registration and Exemption from Taxation) Bill and the Commonwealth Motor Vehicles (Liability) Amendment Bill, have been prepared in the context of the Government's decision to sell or refinance DASFLEET. The ongoing measures in these bills will, however, apply to vehicles leased to the Commonwealth by any company, not just the purchaser of DASFLEET. In addition, because DASFLEET currently provides only half of the vehicles in the Commonwealth's fleet, the ongoing provisions in the bills will extend to any future sale and lease&hyphen;back of Commonwealth vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two pieces of proposed legislation are intended to ensure that registration, taxation and third party insurance arrangements which currently apply to vehicles used by the Commonwealth can continue once those vehicles are privately owned and leased to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Vehicles (Registration and Exemption from Taxation) Bill will establish a Commonwealth register of motor vehicles in which vehicles owned by or
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> leased to the Commonwealth may be registered rather than being registered under State or Territory law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of Commonwealth number plates allows ease of recognition of Commonwealth Government vehicles and has proven to be an effective mechanism for the regulation of their usage. This bill will allow for the continued use of `Z' and other Commonwealth number plates on vehicles once they are no longer owned by the Commonwealth, but are leased for a period of at least three months to the Commonwealth for its use.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also allows for the making of regulations which will provide for details of how the motor vehicle register will be kept and other matters such as how registration plates and labels should be displayed. Further, I intend that public trading enterprises will be exempt under regulations from the coverage of this bill and its companion bill. This will ensure that the proposed legislation does not impact on the competitive position of Commonwealth business enterprises which operate in the market place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to establishing the motor vehicle register, the bill contains measures to exempt the transfer of assets, as well as the ongoing provision of vehicles to the Commonwealth, from State and Territory taxes.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Commonwealth Vehicles (Registration and Exemption from Taxation) Bill, the transfer of DASFLEET assets, including the motor vehicle fleet, will be exempt from State and Territory imposts. This will allow all Australians to benefit from the full proceeds of sale, rather than a proportion of those proceeds being distributed to those States and Territories in which the transfer of assets happens to take place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth currently operates several thousand vehicles which it registers under State and Territory law, most notably vehicles which are provided under the Senior Executive Vehicle Scheme. While the Commonwealth pays registration fees, by virtue of its Constitutional exemption from State and Territory taxes, it does not currently pay stamp duty on the registration of such vehicles. The Commonwealth Vehicles (Registration and Exemption from Taxation) Bill will maintain this position by extending the exemption to the private owner of vehicles where those vehicles are leased to the Commonwealth for at least three months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, where a vehicle is leased to the Commonwealth for a continuous period of three months, these leases will be exempt from State and Territory taxes levied on leasing arrangements. The three month period is intended to capture leases which could be considered to be long&hyphen;term leases, and exclude the short&hyphen;term rental of vehicles for which the taxation exemption would be overly complex to administer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the measures in the bill now before the Senate are not intended to change the Commonwealth's position with respect to the States and Territories. They are merely intended to ensure that the Commonwealth is in the same position with respect to State and Territory
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4657"> law and third party liability coverage after the sale of its vehicle fleet as it was before the sale. This bill together with its companion bill will ensure a minimum of disruption to the supply of vehicles to the Commonwealth once these vehicles are privately owned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">COMMONWEALTH MOTOR VEHICLES (LIABILITY) AMENDMENT BILL 1997</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation is one of two bills arising from issues associated with the sale of DASFLEET. The other companion bill is the Commonwealth Vehicles (Registration and Exemption from Taxation) Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Motor Vehicles (Liability) Amendment Bill will ensure that the provisions of the Commonwealth Motor Vehicles (Liability) Act 1959 will continue to apply once vehicles used by the Commonwealth are not actually owned by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Generally speaking, the Commonwealth self&hyphen;insures against third party liability arising from the use of vehicles which bear Commonwealth number&hyphen;plates. These self insurance arrangements are embodied in the Commonwealth Motor Vehicles (Liability) Act 1959 which provides for third party liability coverage where vehicles are not otherwise insured. The Commonwealth Motor Vehicles (Liability) Amendment Bill now before the Senate will extend the coverage of this act to vehicles which are leased to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, as I indicated during my speech concerning the companion bill, the measures in the bills now before the Senate continue the present legal status of cars used by the Commonwealth whether or not they are directly owned or leased.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, electors faced with a choice at the last election are aware that the headline promise of the coalition at the time was to `resurrect the future for small business', as they put it. In quoting what the coalition promised, in no way do I reflect upon the fine performance of the Labor government leading up to the last election. Many small business people now are lamenting the absence of several of our ministers for small business who had, in fact, opened the doors for opportunity for this industry sector in Australia. Yet, as a political gimmick at the election, the coalition, now the government, promised a new dawn for small business.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4658">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The small business community in Australia now feel betrayed and let down. Many of them may have believed the glowing promises made by the government for the new dawn that it offered but they all now know from their own bitter and personal experience&mdash;an experience that cannot be gainsaid by rhetoric, by any miscalculation or allocation of statistics, or simply by jawboning up the prospects for the sector&mdash;that small business is doing it hard in Australia. The reason why they are doing it hard is the economic settings the coalition government have foisted on the economy and the negative confidence that has been imbued around the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bankruptcies among small business are climbing and the confidence of the small business sector is down. The media release on the Yellow Pages survey entitled `Small business sees no economic recovery&mdash;survey finds' of 27 May 1997 captures the sense of frustration and anger that the small business community in Australia feel. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's small business sector reports no sign of economic recovery. Proprietors' confidence has reached its lowest level since August 1993, according to the latest Yellow Pages Small Business Index.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Index found that at the beginning of May, a net 40 per cent of small business operators were confident about their business prospects for the coming 12 months, compared with a net 44 per cent three months ago and 57 per cent a year ago.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Schacht, a former and distinguished minister for small business, interjects: that just about covers everything. Lamentably it covers a hell of a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lot of the bleak future facing small business in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that this government promised a stronger economy but the economy is underperforming in a devastating and humanly frustrating way. The 1996&hyphen;97 budget forecast economic growth for this nation at 3.75 per cent. The actual outcome, we learnt when the last budget was put down, was a growth rate of 2.4 per cent. Many of us said at the time the 3.75 per cent forecast figure was announced that it was unrealistic. We said that the state of the economy and the cuts that had been engaged in by the coalition government would bring down demand in the  economy to the extent that the economy could not realise those growth figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the course of the year, in debate in this chamber, we have echoed those comments but we have been reassured by government spokespeople that that is not true. The outcome shows that it is true. It is dismally true, it is unfortunately true and it is sadly true that the economy underperformed by 1.35 per cent below the level of forecast growth. There is not, in the 3.75 per cent figure, enough growth in the economy to employ school leavers at the end of the year. As a consequence of pitching a budget to achieve that level of growth, the government was making a positive choice to increase unemployment. It was also making a positive choice to lower aggregate demand in the economy. But because the economy performed at even less than what was forecast, unemployment will be even higher and aggregate demand for goods and services in the economy will be even lower.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen in last month's unemployment figures that unemployment rose by 40,000 people in one month. We know, as I have said, that bankruptcy has continued to rise. In response, we hear from the government that interest rates are continuing to be cut. The reason why they are being cut is that it is a desperate effort to stimulate greater demand in the economy. Nothing much is going on out there and nothing much looks like going on out there to give consumers confidence to buy. So interest rates fall not because of some grand policy setting of the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4659"> government but because the economy is too flat and too lacking in growth to stimulate the necessary demand to create jobs or to create growth for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why interest rates are falling and that is why people do not trust the future in Australia and are saving and not buying. And if consumers do not buy, business does not sell and small businesses face going to the wall. It is a bleak outcome. It is an outcome that the opposition takes no joy in, but it is a fact of life. It would be better for the national economic debate if the government faced those facts, were honest about it, stopped trying to jawbone their way past the truth and dealt with the real issues that affect small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say, at this point, that one of the real issues that affect small business is the leadership this government provides to it in the form of the minister, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Prosser. As I speak in this chamber, Mr Prosser is the subject of a censure motion in the other chamber, the House of Representatives. He is the subject of a call for his resignation. That is because he has misconducted himself as a minister under the code of ministerial conduct of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under that code, Mr Prosser was required to indicate areas where he, in the performance of his ministerial duty, would have conflicts of interest in terms of his private holdings and private ownership of shares. We now have the explicit fact that Mr Prosser, as the owner of a company in Western Australia that owns shopping malls, has had that company affiliated to BOMA, the Business Owners and Managers Association, which in turn, on behalf of its affiliates&mdash;including Mr Prosser's company&mdash;made representations to Mr Prosser about what the law governing the operation of fair trading should be. Through an association, a company he owns makes submissions&mdash;which will go in the end to his private pecuniary advantage&mdash;to him about what he as a law&hyphen;maker with an obligation to Australia should do.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a clear conflict of interest between ministerial obligation and private pecuniary interest. In those circumstances, the Prime Minister&mdash;or the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) in this case&mdash;now has no option. If he wishes to retain the confidence of the small business sector, he must act. He must chop Mr Prosser out of the ministerial loop, put him back on the back bench and try to find someone within coalition ranks whom he can appoint as small business minister who will stand up for small business within government, reviving the confidence of the small business sector. Many in the small business sector, through their organisations and associations, have passed resolutions or called for Mr Prosser's resignation. Small business needs a champion and, from the performance I have so far had a chance to describe, it is obvious that it does not have one within the structure of the government as it stands&mdash;that champion is certainly not Mr Prosser.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this is a motion about the problems that face small business in the economy. Therefore, in this debate I do not want to talk simply about the minister. I can say much more about this, but I conclude by saying again that this is a clear breach of ministerial responsibility and a clear case of a conflict of interests. Under the guidelines that the Prime Minister proposed to us that he would enforce to ensure and restore public confidence in the parliament and the ministry, he has no option now but to act and cause Mr Prosser to resign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition&mdash;and the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kim Beazley&mdash;in the first few months of our being in opposition, brought on a private member's bill to deal with the issue of fair trading. This is a major issue for small business. Increasingly, the overwhelming majority of small businesses find that their businesses take the form of a franchise. That is, they franchise a name or trading label from a franchisor. Small businesses also find, overwhelmingly, that many of them are domiciled in major shopping centres and malls around Australia&mdash;the preferred way in which Australian consumers go about their retail purchases.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4660">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those small businesses who are franchisees and for many of the small businesses who are tenants in major shopping malls, there is a gap in the law. Those small businesses are often exploited. They often have their rents jacked up in unfair ways and in ways in which the efficacy of their own business is brought into question. Franchisees and franchisors are among the most litigious sections of the business community. If one looked for a new growth area of law, one would see an amazing growth in litigation involving the rights of franchisees conflicting with those of franchisors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Franchisees are an under&hyphen;represented group within our community. They are small business people, but often the terms of their franchise are held by the franchisor and they are exploited&mdash;the terms are varied, the conditions are made unrealistic and they are subject to harsh and unconscionable acts at law. The Beazley private member's bill was aimed at rectifying these things. Did the government support that bill? Did the government&mdash;which proclaims and trumpets around this nation that it is the champion of small business&mdash;stand up for the interests of that sector of the small business community? It did not. It rejected the Beazley bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It inaugurated the parliamentary inquiry into fair trading, the result of which is this parliamentary report. The motion I have moved today is for the Senate of Australia to call upon the government to implement the findings of this report. This is a report of a committee of the House of Representatives, a committee which comprises members from all sides of the parliament&mdash;the Liberal, National and Labor parties. This report is unanimous in its conclusion that what the Beazley bill was trying to rectify is a major problem and should be fixed. Kim Beazley was prepared to argue it and have it fixed last year. The inquiry that has been conducted into it has found that it is a serious problem and should now be fixed. This government should move posthaste and forthwith to fix that gap in the law and adopt the recommendations of this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main recommendations of this report would result in the introduction of uniform
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> retail tenancy codes to underpin fair trading within the Trade Practices Act. This report shows that there is a clear need in Australia to protect tenants in major shopping centres from being unfairly prejudiced by the conduct of the owners of those shopping centres. If the recommendations of this report were enacted, there would be specific legislation enacted to protect the interests of small businesses who are franchisees from predatory actions by the owners of the franchises&mdash;the franchisors. As I say, this is one of the most litigious areas in small business law in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the recommendations of this report were enacted, the Trade Practices Act would be amended to protect small businesses generally  from the unfair conduct of larger firms. Larger firms, because of their monopoly of market power, can put conditions and circumstances on small businesses which are harsh and unconscionable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an urgent need to do those things now because, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, bankruptcies are up, business confidence is low and the economic outlook is bleak. In those circumstances, a shot of confidence needs to be injected into the economy for small business. One of the things the government can do immediately to achieve that is move to set the legal framework for fair trading in Australia right, and I trust the Senate will adopt the motion that I have moved in order to ensure that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the few minutes remaining to me, I want to say a couple of things about what Labor has done for small business, because in the rhetoric, in the advertising and in the sloganeering being engaged in by the government, there is a tendency to forget the solid detail of achievement of Labor's record in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We established the AusIndustry scheme. We maintained the export market development scheme at high levels of funding so small businesses could get into export. We introduced and maintained the research and development tax concession to enable small business companies with a scientific or intellectual idea they wanted to trade in the market to develop and expand that idea and create an

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did a number of other things that ensured that the economy was out of recession and growing at a healthy rate. Through Chris Schacht, the minister for small business in the Labor government, and under the Small Business Council, we had the ear of small business which enabled us to work with them to make the law more effective, to create growth prospects for them, to increase opportunity and to increase employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we came to opposition and the coalition came to government, the coalition promised as one of their headline offerings to the electorate that they would reduce the provisional tax uplift factor. It was this opposition, supported by the minor parties in the Senate, that kept the government honest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government proposed to reduce the uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent, but they legislated for the six per cent to apply only for one year and it would then revert to 10 per cent. That was not their promise. Their actions on that occasion were duplicitous and misleading. You could say that, when one looked at the detail of their legislation, the coalition government at the time lied to the community about what they proposed to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This chamber amended that legislation to maintain the uplift factor at six per cent, so the government was kept honest and opportunities were made available for small business.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What gall Senator Cook in particular has, but the Labor Party in general have, in coming into this chamber and moving this general business notice of motion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, prior to this government coming into office 12 or so months ago, we suffered the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tax and spend mentality of 13 years of Labor government. Small business suffered 13 years of an absolute failure by that government to initiate much needed reforms to reduce the cost of doing business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a brief look at what was required to provide a better environment for small business and Labor's record at doing something about creating that environment. We needed a less regulated and more flexible industrial relations system and labour market; Labor failed to provide that. We needed less onerous unfair dismissal laws; Labor failed to provide that. We needed less onerous capital gains and fringe benefits taxes; Labor failed to provide that. We needed less costly tax compliance provisions; Labor failed to provide that. We needed lower interest rates;  Labor failed to provide that. We certainly, as far as small business was concerned, needed reduced government red tape; Labor failed absolutely to provide that. Need I go on about the failings of the previous Labor government in relation to small business.</PARA>

They have been aided and abetted in this by the minority parties in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do I have to remind the Senate yet again of the travelling circus that Labor initiated about a year ago to delay and frustrate industrial relations reform? The Senate economics committee was dragged all over this country to hear repeated, like a cracked record, the identical, centrally orchestrated false claims about that legislation coming from the union movement and provided by union after union. Despite that circus that went around week
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4662"> after week in June and July last year, we came back to this chamber and then had an extended filibuster on the legislation before an amended form of it finally got through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now see the same attempt being made to thwart the much needed reform of unfair dismissal laws specifically aimed at giving small businesses encouragement to employ more people. Currently, employers have a three&hyphen;month period of grace to sack staff without fear of unfair dismissal claims. The government wants to extend this employment period to up to one year for small businesses with fewer than 15 staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, staff can be sacked without notice for theft, fraud, assault, drunkenness or refusing to comply with a contract or reasonable request. However, for all other complaints, employers must prove that the complaint is valid, they must notify the employee and they must allow time for correct behaviour. The government's proposed unfair dismissal exemption for small business will overcome the fear which small business has in employing people because of its being subject to this particular piece of legislation. It is therefore pro-jobs and it is pro-employment. It is saying to employers that the government is going to put in place a system which is fair to both employers and employees.</PARA>

Fifty-seven per cent of those surveyed said that the reduced interest rates have already improved small business or would improve their situation over the next 12 months. It is a benefit delivered by this government to small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has also introduced capital gains tax roll over specifically for small business, again in the face of a hostile Labor Party attitude. Thanks to this government, small business people can sell their businesses worth up to $5 million in value and that sale be free of capital gains tax up to an amount of $500,000 per partner or shareholder if the proceeds are reinvested in another business or if the business is sold for retirement purposes. That is a significant benefit for small business and a significant incentive for investment, savings and job creation for the engine of job creation: small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Shortly after the election, the government established the small business task force. It delivered its report in November. The recommendations in that report were speedily considered by the cabinet and largely adopted, as announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Prosser, in March of this year. As a consequence of that, the government is moving to remove the burden of unnecessary paperwork, to simplify tax and corporate legislation, to reduce the complexity in compliance costs and paperwork with regard to fringe benefits tax and indeed to abolish fringe benefits tax with regard to car parking&mdash;again a bane of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another of the recommendations adopted is the institution of a pay as you go tax regime for small business. There are a number of other positive measures being initiated&mdash;in particular, changing the culture within the Public Service to a more pro-business attitude, a more service orientated attitude, with an understanding of the needs of small business when they are dealing with government departments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, more recently, Senator Schacht, the Prime Minister announced that tax reform will be a major part of this government's agenda, again directed towards particularly reforming the situation to allow business in general and small business in particular to become much more productive, obviously with the goal of removing those taxes that are cost inputs to the productive process and cost inputs to exporters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also mention in the context of this motion that today the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs has introduced a new kit to better inform small business on the opportunities and challenges provided by competition policy. We want an informed small business  sector, not a small business sector kept in the dark as they were when this mob were in government. Perhaps Senator Cook might avail himself of that information and indulge in a few remedial reading lessons so that he is better informed about what this government is indeed doing for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget, of course, is of particular benefit to small business, because it again for the second year avoids the imposition of additional taxes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the good news that that survey provides, far be it from me to question the efficacy of that survey. But let me remind the Senate what members of the Labor Party say about that survey. One of the former colleagues of Senator Cook and Senator Schacht, Ted Lindsay, said of the publication that it was fatally flawed and politically biased. He said, `We say on the record that this report has no integrity.' This was when they were in government, but now in opposition it has become the Labor Party's oracle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me simply reinforce that the Howard Liberal&hyphen;National Party government is strongly committed to the welfare of small business, strongly committed to making the necessary reforms and changes to reduce the cost of business, which is particularly needed by small business and will be particularly beneficial to the growth of small business, the growth of their profits and growth of the opportunity for them to provide much needed employment in this country.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without casting any aspersions on the quality and character of the government senators who will speak, who are all perfectly capable and articulate people, nevertheless we are presented here with a situation where we have on the Labor side two former ministers prepared to debate this, accompanied by two of their colleagues, and on the government side there is no sign of the minister representing the minister for small business, Senator Parer, and there is no sign of any frontbencher apart from one who gets, I suppose, a little closer, namely, the whip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have amongst these three a farmer who is a leading light in the small and fundamentalist HR Nicholls Society; we have an exceptionally wealthy farmer who is an investor in big agribusiness; and we have another wealthy farmer who is involved in agribusiness. I really think that, when you have something like half the Senate to draw from, whilst it is good for various members of the Senate to get their airing whenever necessary, it does show the lack of seriousness with which the government is viewing what is going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with this government, in my view, is that it says one thing and does another. It says it is supportive of manufacturing, yet it follows policies and activities which attack that sector. It says it supports families, and then it follows policies and does things which result in an attack on families. I say to you that in my opinion the same thing happens with small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no good, if you are the coalition, talking up your constituency; it is no good raising expectations, if you are not going to satisfy them. In one respect I am extremely grateful to you for doing that job, because I think the result of it will be such anger and such pressure that you will have to do something about what small business needs. I think you will be forced to react appropriately. You have talked up that constituency so far and you have satisfied its expectations so little that I think you are going to feel the effects of that. Already you have lost its confidence

You did make reforms through the Workplace Relations Act, particularly in regard to the unfair dismissal changes that you have introduced, which are now six months old. They have had a particularly good effect on small business. When they find out what you have done, they feel that that is a wonderful job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, unfortunately, members of the coalition suffer from political senility. Your highest representative, the Prime Minister, could not even remember that he had actually got those laws passed; he still went ranting and raving on about the Brereton laws. Now again we hear a similar theme&mdash;when the unfair dismissal changes are delivering the goods already for small business, and small business thanks you for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What else have you done? You have made the capital gains tax changes. I recall hearing  the first expression of them, defended in a somewhat misunderstanding way, if you like, by Senator Parer in the estimates process, when we told him in that process that what he was proposing in terms of `like business' and a very restricted process was entirely wrong. I congratulate you. You listened to the Democrats, you listened to Labor and you listened to small business, and you have changed it and you have improved it. So you have done well on capital gains tax. You have done well to introduce fringe benefits tax changes. Again, the small business constituency is grateful for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have embarked upon cutting the paper trail for small business, on cutting down on regulations and so on. Again, you should be congratulated. You are fortunate, as a government, in being in an economic cycle where you have been able to accelerate trends, which were already established under the previous government, of interest rate cuts. I think you have added to the climate in which those interest rate cuts could have occurred. You should be congratulated for that as well. And you should be congratulated for reinforcing a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4667"> low inflation climate which had commenced under the previous government. For all those things, yes, you should take some credit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have you done that is bad for small business? You have hammered the hell out of them in terms of R&amp;D. You have shrunk the best export program we have ever had in this country, the export market development grant program. You have done a disgraceful job there. You have slashed business and labour programs, you have cut tens of thousands of jobs, you have lost jobs and you have damaged confidence, appallingly. It is no accident that, in reply to the question of what are the big issues worrying small business, Dr John Marsden said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Very simple, lack of work, lack of sales, cashflow, consumer confidence and competition from big business.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is it. Senator Chapman, Dr Marsden is not a discredited person when he says that. He is correctly reflecting the views of small business. I say to you: it is within your power to change that; it is within your power to advance the cause of small business. You have been delivered a fair trading report on a cross-party basis, which is singularly effective in terms of its recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that the backbench of the coalition are a bunch of mugs. I believe that they do know that small business are uptight and upset and want these things changed. So instead of defending the indefensible, why don't you grasp the opportunity with both hand and say, `Yep, that's ours. We're going to do the job and small business will be grateful.' If you do that job, by God, they will be grateful. If you attend to those things in that fair trading report, you will go down, for small business, as the best government they have ever had. This is what will happen if you deliver, and deliver well, on every one of those recommendations. Do not resist them, do not vote against them and do not cringe and whine and complain on your way whilst you are doing so. Grab the opportunity with both hands. It has been presented to you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have you still to do? You have a problem: small business still experiences the highest real rates of interest in the OECD. Some interest rates are still running at up to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 14 per cent on fixed loans which were arranged some time ago. Small businesses are still not getting the cheap finance they deserve. Yes, if they are granted the cheap finance they deserve, bank profits will drop. It will be a direct transfer from the shareholders of banks to the pockets of small business. That is the choice you face. I do know that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has been talking that side of it up, but that is not enough. They want action which is effective in delivering cheap finance on a wide basis to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us talk about the franchisors and the franchisees. It is no good having a minister who has gone very close, cheek to cheek, with franchisors and their interests and has acted against the interest of franchisees. It is the franchisees who represent small business, not the franchisors. You are talking there of a $42 billion industry. It is such an easy thing to fix. They just need a mandatory code underpinned by legislation, qualified privilege for an independent board governing them and harsh and unconscionable provisions in the act that covers it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what is your problem? Your problem is that those are contrary to the interests of big business. It is a $42 billion industry. If the advantage to big business of fixing that deal the way they have is one per cent, it is worth $420 million. The three wealthy farmers who have spoken, or who are to speak, will understand that language. But small business wants the franchise thing fixed. Grasp the opportunity with both hands and respond to the fair trading report. Do the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us talk about retail tenancies. In my view, commercial tenancy and retailers' tenants rights are an extension of human rights, because those people are oppressed by large numbers of landlords and lawyers as the weak end of the chain. They are the weak; they are the afflicted. For that reason, you need to pay attention to their needs. Do not pay attention to a minister whose entire interest is in keeping the landlord side of things jacked up. Pay attention to the fair trading report.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4668">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the retail tenancy stories in the fair trading report brought tears to my eyes. You are talking there about people who have lost their homes and their businesses. They have turned to alcoholism and their families have broken up because of the way the law is fixed up at present to favour the landlord against the tenant, and because of the way they have been stitched up, particularly by the cartel, the oligopoly of big business landlords. Respond to that, for goodness sake. Understand the issue, deal with it, take the opportunity to fix the retail tenancy thing. Get out of the pockets of your big business donors and get into the hearts and into the morality by supporting the retail tenancy needs of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go along to harsh and unconscionable conduct. For 20 years, for over two decades, small business has battled to get into the Trade Practices Act. It has said, `Please, give us the same privilege, the same protection, that the law gives ordinary consumers. Please protect us from big business franchises. Please protect us from big business landlords. Please protect us from big business suppliers. Give us the protection which is recognised in that law for others.' For over two decades&mdash;I am afraid, Labor, it is to your eternal shame, and I know some of you fought to do it&mdash;that you did not change that law. Give them the black-letter law, the black-letter protection that they demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to you once again that that cross&hyphen;party fair trading report has recommendations which you should embrace with both hands. Instead of running off overseas or wherever your ministers like to go, why didn't they come out and say, `This is great. This is a report we can support, and we will do something about this as soon as possible'? That is the reason, I am afraid, that your minister and your government do not enjoy the confidence of small business, because you have talked up their expectations but you have not delivered on the things that matter to them most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not mugs out there and they know that those things that I have outlined&mdash;the things which affect finance; the things which affect their relationships with franchisors and landlords and big business; the things which affect their tenancies; the things which affect
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their daily relationship with the law and the protection they should enjoy under the law&mdash;would deliver them a safe and secure future. Those things would deliver them the confidence they need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have got such a wonderful opportunity. You have a year and a half to go before you get back into that election. If you deliver on those things, small business will bless you. That package of recommendations, put together and delivered, would make small business exceptionally pleased with this government, instead of disappointed, upset, aggravated, insecure and often in dire stress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your government is fixing up a legacy out there of people who are getting hurt by your policies. All you ever say to us in this chamber is, `Oh, but we balanced the books.' That is an important goal, but it is not your goal as a government. Your main goal as a government is to make the lives and opportunities of Australians better. We are talking here about small business. We are talking about nearly one million small businesses. We are talking about six or seven million people who are employed and who work in small businesses.  We are talking about the fundamental wealth of Australians. We are talking about businesses which are defined as being below 20 employees or below 100 if they are manufacturing. We are talking about the backbone of Australian commercial, family, cultural and community life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These things we talk about, these things which were referred to in my previous motions&mdash;which grudgingly got through the Senate, with no help from the coalition&mdash;and which are going to get through today, hopefully, through Senator Cook's motion, are what matter to small business, not this carping, aggravated, resistant, whingeing grunge that I hear. For goodness sake, get out there and take this opportunity in both hands, because you have talked up the constituency, it has high expectations, and what is happening is that you have failed them so far.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this motion of Senator Cook's and I do so with considerable enthusiasm. I do so, unlike Senator Chapman, who I do not think got onto the second page
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4669"> of the motion, page 18, of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> . Part of the motion does deal with the Yellow Pages index, Senator Chapman, that is true, and the comments of Dr Marsden. Over the page, it deals with the comments of the Australian Certified Practising Accountants, and then it deals with the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that there was not much coverage in your remarks towards the recommendations of that report. I am not surprised. I think there are many Liberals&mdash;many coalition members&mdash;who would be dry economists, economic rationalists, who would find many of these recommendations too interventionist for any government, let alone a coalition government, even though those recommendations, if adopted, would clearly assist small business get a better deal in this community against the power of big business and other groups with large economic power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is most apt to move the motion this week when the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) is making a real mess of himself in trying to explain to the Australian parliament how he can be a major shopping centre owner, with several scores of tenants who are franchisees who are in retail tenancy arrangements with himself, explaining how he is the minister for small business responsible for instituting the report from the House of Representatives committee. He gave the committee its terms of reference. He made remarks at the end of last year about the range of issues that are in here, including retail tenancy issues, including franchising issues. He then says, `There is no conflict of interest.' When you examine his pecuniary interest list, he does not declare&mdash;and has not previously declared&mdash;that he was a significant shopping centre landlord.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As many commentators have written in today's and yesterday's press, if Mr Howard's ministerial code of conduct means anything, this minister should resign. He has misled the parliament in the conduct of what he has declared his interests are, and has clearly not been under Mr Howard's own rules&mdash;no&hyphen;one
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> else's rules, but the rules that Mr Howard laid down that, if he was elected Prime Minister, this is what he would impose on all his ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, there is a different rule for Mr Prosser than there is for most other ministers&mdash;or, conversely, the ministerial code of conduct, as announced at the last election by the then leader of the opposition, now Prime Minister, does not stand for anything. It is a disposable document. Now it is an embarrassment to the Prime Minister. He now has selective amnesia about its conditions and the rules that are in it. I think he probably feels that he is very lucky this Thursday to be in Great Britain. He will be able to enjoy himself at Lord's cricket ground rather than dealing with this issue of the conflict of interest that the present minister for small business has clearly got on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a former minister for small business, I wanted to say that this is a report on which the coalition members had a clear majority in the House of Representatives, yet its recommendations are absolutely unanimous. I congratulate all members in the House of  Representatives who put this report together and made unanimous recommendations. The recommendations, though occasionally worded differently, as Senator Cook pointed out, are absolutely in line with Mr Beazley's private member's bill that he introduced into the House of Representatives last year on unconscionable conduct and fair trading under the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendations are absolutely in line with the draft bill that I introduced into the parliament in late 1995 as minister for small business, a package which I called `Better business'. Every relevant small business organisation in Australia which was represented at the small business forum&mdash;some 30 plus&mdash;unanimously supported this package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that yesterday the so-called Small Business Coalition, which is administered by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry but represents a similar number of small business organisations&mdash;a very disparate group of small business organisations, who disagree with each other on many issues&mdash;
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4670">unanimously endorsed every recommendation in this report, just as nearly two years ago they endorsed every recommendation of mine to amend the Trade Practices Act to strengthen the unconscionable conduct provisions to protect small business against the economic power of big business. There is not a word from any of the coalition speakers today about whether they support this report or not and/or the Small Business Coalition's unanimous support for these recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray, in his remarks just finished, hit one nail very clearly on the head, amongst many that he clearly and accurately identified. He was dead right to say that the problem with the coalition is that some backbench members, and even some frontbench members, such as Senator Ron Boswell, who is a dedicated supporter of small business interests, will get rolled by the interests of big business, as represented by the Treasurer of this country, Mr Costello, and the big end of town coming out of Collins Street in Melbourne and Pitt Street in Sydney, particularly the big business Melbourne establishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was consistently told on a number of occasions in 1995 by many people in the small business community, `Minister, we absolutely support your recommendations and the legislation. We will do everything to lobby the coalition to support it and to get it through quickly, but the problem you will have is that the big business interests in Melbourne and Sydney will put the weights on the coalition to run dead on it and not support it.' One would have thought that with a report such as the report now before us, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS>, and the recommendations unanimously put forward, the government would not wait several months to respond. They would be able to respond if they had all this knowledge and interest about small business in a matter of a very few weeks because every one of these issues has been debated in this parliament and in the Australian community for several years now.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing in this report that is a surprise. The arguments about the amendments to the Trade Practices Act on unconscionable conduct have been debated endlessly. There is no constitutional or legislative surprise in here. I find it very instructive that the coalition government will wait several months before they even respond. What they are being told now by the big end of town in Melbourne is, `Forget it; can you find a way to let this document with these recommendations gather dust in some pigeon hole and let's just hope it drifts away.' That has been the track record of the coalition whenever there has been a move to strengthen the law to help small business where it really counts. They go on endlessly saying, `The only thing we're going to do is reduce paperwork.' They have not reduced the paperwork; they said they were going to reduce it by 50 per cent. There has been no indication that it has been reduced by five per cent, let alone by 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Mr Prosser became minister after the last election he said that there would be 100 days of action for small business. There was no action in the first 15 months, let alone the first 100 days. We can see from the opposition side&mdash;and I think we have the support of  the Democrats on this; in view of Senator Murray's remarks, I think he would absolutely agree&mdash;that this coalition government is trying to work out a way to have the report dropped in the bin and ignored. We will certainly make it an issue. We will certainly campaign on it. We endorse all of these recommendations because they are in line with the private member's bill that Mr Beazley introduced last year. They are in line with the Trade Practices Amendment (Better Business Conduct) Bill that I introduced in November 1995. There are a few minor word changes and so on, but the intent is absolute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where this minister, Mr Prosser, has made such a mess is in the franchising code area and in codes generally for things such as the petrol code. During 1995 I met with the petroleum industry. We had the big petrol companies on one side&mdash;the refiners&mdash;and the small retailers on the other side. I chaired a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4671"> number of meetings to get them to accept a voluntary code so that both sides would agree to a code of conduct between them as franchisors and franchisees. It became clear to me that the only way that code could work is if it was underpinned by strengthening the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act so if there was a breach, a small business could go to the law and get remedy without going broke. That was clear. I indicated to the small business community and to the petroleum companies that that was why we wanted to amend the Trade Practices Act at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also indicated, despite the pressure from the petroleum companies, that we would not repeal the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act. I notice in this report that there is a specific recommendation not to repeal those two acts until the unconscionable conduct and the franchising amendments are already in place. If those two acts are repealed, and there is no amendment to the Trade Practices Act, the petrol retailers of Australia will be at the absolute mercy of the petrol  companies. They will have no defence in the restructuring of their industry, and some of it will have to be restructured. Both sides agree that there are probably too many petrol retailers in this country. The way in which the restructuring is done, the small business people will not be left without any recompense for the lifetime of work they have put in to running those petrol stations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This minister has failed at getting that code up. He does not understand that petrol retailers will not come on board unless these amendments go through first. Why would they? Why would they take on trust the word of the petroleum companies who, through multi&hyphen;site franchising and so on, are restructuring the industry and, in many cases, making offers to the petrol retailers of ridiculous and paltry sums to buy them out of remaining leases or when the lease runs out just saying, `Goodbye, your contribution to our industry and our company as an efficient franchisee comes to nothing'.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us turn to the franchising code itself. Last year, Minister Prosser had no idea what he was doing when he cut the money to the Franchising Code Administration Council of Australia. He collapsed that organisation, after we increased the funding to it at the request of the franchising industry so that the code, a voluntary code, could work where the franchisors would be registered and signed on to a code that outlined transparent rules of how to conduct a franchise arrangement in Australia. This minister, by saving $600,000, collapsed a voluntary code for a $40 billion industry. It is an astonishing decision. It showed that he did not know what he was doing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw. When the minister made this decision, I thought he did not understand. I still think that is the best construction you could put on the decision. As a result, the franchising code of Australia collapsed. The 400 or 500 franchisors who tried to do the right thing and sign up to the code now have no code to sign up to and cannot say to their franchisees, `There is a genuine code here which we want to apply in the conduct of our business with you.' Some people in the industry say that they still apply that code voluntarily.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This recommendation of the fair trading report makes it clear that there should be specific amendments of legislation, including
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4672"> unconscionable conduct, so that the code has intent, has a standing, and can be used to ensure that the economic power of big franchisors is not used against the power of small franchisees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an astonishing thing that a coalition government that prides itself on supposedly helping small business would show such an abject lack of knowledge and allow a $40 billion industry code of practice to collapse for the sake of $600,000. It is also astonishing that they do not understand how the franchising industry works. If properly managed, franchising is an excellent way to encourage people to go into business because it has rules and arrangements that give them a better chance of success&mdash;but only if it is properly organised and only with proper transparency in the rules. This minister has overwhelmingly failed in those two areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now want to turn to the Yellow Pages report that came out on 27 May. When Senator Chapman spoke in the debate, he made a number of remarks which Senator Cook and I found provocative, and you, Mr Acting Deputy President, quite rightly pulled us up and said that remarks should be made through you, that interjections were disorderly. The reason Senator Cook and I got quite agitated about the remarks of Senator Chapman is that he was implying that we did not know what we were reading, that we did not understand what was in this report. In his press release, Dr Marsden, in the third paragraph, third sentence, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In line with this finding, more than 80 per cent of small businesses see the economy as being in recession or at a standstill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I find that unambiguous. Senator Chapman tried to claim we were misquoting that figure. When I was small business minister I had the honour of launching, on behalf of Yellow Pages, the first survey results. When Yellow Pages came to me and told me that they were establishing a databank where about 1,100 businesses across Australia would be surveyed on a quarterly basis&mdash;properly and statistically balanced&mdash;with some additions and some deletions every quarter to make sure that the same businesses were not being surveyed, I said, `I think that is an excellent idea.' Every
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government of the day&mdash;this parliament&mdash;should welcome any information it can get about what is going on in small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As small business minister, I had to occasionally put up with criticism in the Senate when small business surveys came out that had results in them that were not comforting for the then Labor government. I never bagged the report. I may have disagreed with some interpretation, but I never attacked the validity and statistical basis of these reports. I knew that you could not do that because they were structured on a basis of transparency which could not be questioned; although you could certainly question the interpretation occasionally. Overwhelmingly, I took my lumps as well as my cheers when the reports came out&mdash;sometimes with good news for the then federal government, sometimes with bad or modest results for the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So when this government stands up and says, `This report is being misinterpreted by the opposition,' that is just nonsense. When they try to destroy the credibility of this report, that is just nonsense. This report is an excellent one and cannot be ignored. Clearly, from quarter to quarter, there will be different trends. But one line in the report which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . more than 80 per cent of small businesses see the economy as being in recession or at a standstill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">is unambiguous in its description of why small business has a lack of confidence in our  economy. That is why there is no growth and no increase in employment&mdash;small business does not have confidence. This shows it. I hope that the government learns from such surveys and adopts some initiatives to encourage growth of at least four per cent to get growth in the economy and jobs going, as they overwhelmingly will come to the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support Senator Cook's motion. It is a very apt motion and I commend it to the Senate. All I know is that this government has let down one segment of the Australian community which it promised everything to in the last election. It has not delivered.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4674"> does not think that Senator Schacht and Senator Cook are the B&hyphen;team of the Labor Party, then he has not been around here long enough to see their performances, not only as former ministers but also in the political juggling that is going on in the opposition benches at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is well reported that there are serious leadership and policy tensions within the opposition. We have seen that with the publication of the policy paper of the member for Melbourne, Lindsay Tanner. The fact that Senator Cook has had to do the second urgency motion means that no-one else has the time to come into the chamber and debate the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray has mentioned that this government does not support the manufacturing industry. What a short memory he has. Within only the last couple of weeks this government has made a landmark decision on the manufacturing industry and in respect of our support of the car manufacturing industry. In fact, I would go so far as to say that Senator Cook's motion today really picks up from where he last left off. He was the last opposition member to move an urgency motion against the government, and this motion is not much different in its make&hyphen;up. He seems to get all the bad jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that they are related in many respects. The last urgency motion moved by Senator Cook related to the car industry. He spent a whole afternoon attempting to predict the government's car industry policy ahead of time. That fell flat because, in truth, the government's policy was welcomed not only by the major car manufacturing industries&mdash;and supported by the opposition&mdash;but also by the many small businesses that are ancillary to that major industry, the car components industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to remind the opposition, that policy was in fact to continue the existing reduction of tariffs to the year 2000 and then freeze them at 15 per cent to the year 2005, when they would be reduced to 10 per cent. That was put in place to preserve not only some 20,000 jobs in the four major car industries but also some 25,000 and more jobs in the car
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> components industry, many of which are in regional Australia&mdash;namely, Ballarat and Bendigo in my state of Victoria. Senator Murray certainly has a very short memory when it comes to recalling this government's policy actions in relation to the manufacturing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook got it wrong there, and he has got it wrong here too because he so selectively quoted the now famous Yellow Pages survey, which we also did when we were in opposition. It is very predictable: the day the Yellow Pages survey comes out, the opposition is straight in here quoting selectively what they can to their advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What he failed to quote from that particular survey&mdash;and I would suggest deliberately&mdash;were two other questions. One of them asked small business whether they were confident or worried about the future. Some 60 per cent were totally confident about the future and only 20 per cent were worried&mdash;that is, some one in three are very confident about the future. The other question that Senator Cook failed to mention in his address was that, when asked about the economy a year from now, over 30 per cent said the economy would be better and 13 per cent said it would be worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone can come in here and selectively quote the Yellow Pages, but in full they were in fact a resounding endorsement of government policy. Of all the questions in there, I would certainly prefer that confidence vote of 60 per cent of the small businesses supporting  our government and having great hope and confidence in the future. I do not think the Yellow Pages survey is a very powerful weapon at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can be sure of some things with regard to this government. One of them is that we are not going to arrogantly dismiss small business, as the previous government did&mdash;as I said&mdash;with the words, `You've never had it so good,' and `What are you all on about?' Those words will forever ring as the motto of the opposition towards small business. I would challenge any poll where we go head to head with the opposition on small business popularity. We would win every time. They are not going to forget your past performance.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4675">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business is only too aware of how they were savaged by the previous government with high interest rates, fixed rates of up to 17 per cent, overdrafts of 20 per cent to 25 per cent and the Laurie Brereton unfair dismissal laws&mdash;you have heard that a few times in this chamber. We will not let you forget the disastrous effect that had on unemployment, let alone your own unemployment record, I should add.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The small business proprietors were also very affected by those rising unemployment rates during your time. It is not easy to lay off people, people you have worked closely with. Do not think small business, or any employer for that matter, gets any joy at all out of having to lay off workers because of an uncaring government in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the tax issues that you visited upon small business&mdash;the tax compliance cost, the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax&mdash;were all a burden not only in dollar terms but also in their complexity, which added to the cost. The time that small business had to put in just to understand their new obligations under this government added to the frustration and cost that small business endured over the past 13 years of your government. How quickly we forget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In stark contrast&mdash;and it does not surprise you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that I contrast their performance in government with our performance in government&mdash;we recognise small business, to use a cliche, as the engine room of employment. It is a cliche, but there are some 800,000 or more small businesses.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take it as a serious interjection. I would like to take my full time, if I can, to outline our government's performance. If small business employed just one extra person, we would not have an unemployment problem. To that end,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we have put in a strategy to encompass that motto that we hold dear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Almost the first thing we did when we came into government was to introduce the Workplace Relations Bill to totally abolish, totally get rid of, the unfair dismissal laws and also to introduce far more flexible and workable workplace agreements. Added to that, we brought in many tax relief policies directly targeted to small business, going to the heart of their bottom line. We could not have done it quickly enough. Regardless of how this Senate obstructs this government's legislation, miraculously we have almost been able to get through our tax policy for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our first term we reduced the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent, which is calculated as $80 million worth of tax relief for small business. The introduction of the capital gains tax rollover from 1 July 1997 is going to allow small business with assets of $5 million or less to be sold or the assets of the business to be sold and rolled over into another business. Also, the small businesses with remittances of less than $25,000 from 1 July 1998 will now be able to pay quarterly rather than monthly. This is an estimated $500 million cash flow advantage for small business in the years 1998&hyphen;99.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have abolished the fringe benefits tax on taxis to and from work for small business. We have abolished the fringe benefits tax on car parking, which was one of the great frustrations of business and had an enormous compliance cost to it. We have kicked out  about half of the account keeping requirements for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These sorts of advancements have all gone to the bottom line of small business in a very short time. But we have not just rested on our laurels in regard to tax reform. We have now opened up the debate for major tax reform in this country&mdash;and not before time. It took a coalition government to have the courage and the dare to raise this debate in the public forum. We have done this because we know only too well that our tax system has its difficulties and it cannot go on in its existing form. It has three major failings. Firstly, the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4676"> tax burden falls overly on business inputs in ways that damage competitiveness. Secondly, it allows so much scope for avoidance, particularly the cash economy. Thirdly, the revenue base is eroding away, which the parliament is well aware of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we also acknowledge that tax reform in itself is not enough. The burden of the cost of money is also a high priority of small business&mdash;namely, interest rates. To that end we have put in place a strategy to put downward pressure on interest rates. The best thing this government can do in that regard is to balance its budget and to have some expenditure restraint&mdash;something the former government totally lacked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have set in train a program that means by 1999 the budget will be balanced. More than that, we have introduced the charter of budget honesty so that&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the opposition are not interested in any way, shape or form in how you can bring interest rates down in this country. We have had great success with it and I venture to say there is more to come. But the whole point is
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the lower interest rates are a reward for the budget surplus that we will have in place by 1999. That is the reward you get for reducing the debt factor which, to remind you, in the last four years of your government jumped from $30 billion to $100 billion. That is the debt we have to get down. That is the debt we are working to get down with the sale of Telstra, with $7 billion going towards that debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in my opening remarks, it is a tactical blunder by you yet again in letting Senator Cook and Senator Schacht from your side of the house take up the tactics in the Senate. You are going to lose every time because there is absolutely nothing this government enjoys more than getting up and talking about small business.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to follow up a few comments from the previous speaker, Senator McGauran, when he mentioned Minister Fahey. In my contribution today to support this motion, I think we will find that Minister Fahey has actually played an intricate role in the progressive disenfranchisement of small businesses in this country. But I will make a few general comments first.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that small business in this country does feel betrayed. Here in the ACT we had an example of not only a prominent  member of the information technology business community but the Vice President of the ACT branch of the Liberal Party actually resigning in disgust from the Liberal Party as a direct result of their appalling policies in relation to small business. I think that that, above anything else, is the greatest indictment upon this government because, effectively, what Mr Cadogan&hyphen;Cowper said was that he was a member of the Liberal Party because he believed the Liberal Party represented the interests of small business.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4677">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Mr Cadogan&hyphen;Cowper resigned from the Liberal Party he said that he was totally disillusioned with the government of Prime Minister John Howard. This same person was once an adviser to former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser! In running his computer business now, he made these observations from a point of view of a commitment to small business in Australia and a belief in a party he felt and understood to be committed to that sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He said he had tried to get the message through to the federal government without success. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They have stopped listening. They don't have an industry policy. They are putting representatives of big business on committees to investigate small business. I've got to the position where I can no longer tell people the Liberal Party is the best option. We really don't know what we're doing.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Cadogan&hyphen;Cowper went on to state that there was little coordination between ministries and that he was deeply troubled by the threat to the privacy of Australians, as confidential information about them would be sent overseas to be processed by multinational companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will leave it there but, in my opening remarks on this issue, that&mdash;above anything else&mdash;is one of the greatest indictments of this government and their business. This is a sector of small business that is critical to future growth. At this point in time, what other industry has the potential that information technology has to grow, expand and establish itself in the global economy? And what greater indictment of the government is there than the changes to the incentives for small business with respect to research and development, with respect to the syndication system and the EMDG in promoting and allowing small businesses to expand and improve themselves? All those measures taken by this Liberal government in reducing that support for small business have been felt very hard by small business. If they were not directly affected, it still sends small businesses a very clear message that they are not on the priority list of this Liberal government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the more interesting observations I have been privy to recently was a report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The knowledge economy</EMPHASIS>, which states the fact that to invest in industry development and the growth of small business is to invest in the whole economy. Specifically targeted industry development programs have the effect of benefiting a whole economy. To take away such benefits has a synergistic effect of decline in that sector. The net effect of taking away three programs with respect to incentives for R&amp;D is worse than it appears to be on paper. For those reasons, small business is quite frightened about this government, which got elected, effectively, on the back of private sector industry, which has now been betrayed by that government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the biggest decisions taken by this government that is impacting on the sector I want to focus on&mdash;information technology&mdash;is the decision by the Minister for Finance, Mr Fahey, to outsource a significant proportion of government work. Apart from all the implications relating to the flawed justification behind that activity itself, it is a very interesting exercise to analyse the way the government is handling this outsourcing process, if you look at the implications for small Australian businesses and for large transnationals in that sector. It is a good case study, because it epitomises this government's approach to business in Australia. The evidence&mdash;as I work through it&mdash;will demonstrate that there is a massive weighting towards the interests of large corporations against those of small indigenous Australian businesses. I am using one example in the IT sector, but you would find similar stories elsewhere. This is something the small business sector is just starting to realise the full implications of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister Fahey has structured the process of outsourcing of IT to effectively discriminate against indigenous companies. I do not make this assertion just off the cuff but on the basis that I have studied the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> transcript of the estimates hearings of the committee which looked into the government department handling this process. As part of the Department of Finance, the Office of Government Information Technology have put on the public record the guidelines within which they
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4678"> are operating in their consideration of the outsourcing of the IT business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first quote I will give is from the hearings of the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee on 3 June, 1997. This goes to the issue of what preconditions the Minister for Finance places on contracts for the potential vendors who are going to be tendering for the IT outsourcing contracts. I asked Mr Macdonald, the Chief of the Office of Government information Technology:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To what degree of formality has the minister provided advice that regional employment initiatives will actually constitute a favourable assessment to potential tenderers?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Macdonald responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been no tender documents yet so there has been no formal advice. We would anticipate that in the tender documents there would be reference to the fact that the government considers the involvement of SMEs and regional development to be important aspects of the bid. Opportunities to leverage the investment in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region to create jobs in Australia would be favourably looked at as well.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That statement, by its very definition, would suggest that small to medium enterprises have been overlooked in getting in on the first base. The implication of that is that some involvement with them would be desirable&mdash;and Minister Fahey has gone on the public record to that effect as well&mdash;but they have been excluded already.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to that, I would like to draw the Senate's attention to a statement Mr Fahey made which was quoted by Senator Kemp at the estimates hearings of the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note that part of the criteria for the outsourcers will be to demonstrate a commitment to providing employment in regional Australia and a capacity to partner with local small and medium information technology companies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, that reinforces the point. It seems to me that the minister had already decided that small to medium Australian IT companies were going to be excluded from the opportunity to tender for these large contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I would like to make is that capability is one thing, but the government
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have specifically structured those IT outsourcing contracts on a cluster basis, which means those contracts can only be dealt with by partnership arrangements or by a large firm. So by the way they have structured the whole process, they have excluded local industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government have also not allowed enough time for industry or market development to occur so Australian businesses can get themselves in the position to tender for these large contracts. This clustering arrangement came effectively out of the blue and, while it has been discussed for quite some time, it is effectively a mechanism to make it very hard for local indigenous IT firms to compete for those contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of what happens next and the future of those small to medium enterprises in that sector, it is interesting to note that, when challenged on this point, the Office of Government Information Technology responded with comments to the effect that they recognised this was an issue. Mr Macdonald indicated that they had engaged the cooperation of the Australian Information Industries Association to help them resolve some of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that, now they are starting to receive complaints from IT firms in this area, they are not turning to their own policy makers, their own bureaucratic structures or the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser)&mdash;who knows where he is in this process&mdash;they are actually going to the industry association and saying, `You'd better help us out here because we haven't got it right. Provide us with some advice.' It seems to me that that is the lazy  way out and it shows they have missed the mark. They have to now go back to the industry and seek a process that will allow them to squirm out of this disastrous situation they have got themselves into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of opportunity provided to these companies, there is no doubt that the complaints have been falling on deaf ears. I would like to turn to some quotes made by industry representatives with respect to these problems. On 13 May the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> reported that the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4679"> outgoing manager of Oracle, Mr Neil Weston, in response to a question about the outsourcing initiative, particularly in the UK, said, `Some people are comfortable with it and some aren't.' The journalist's interpretation of subsequent comments made by Mr Weston was:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change meant some companies would have to significantly invest in their businesses to meet the demands of government contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of this, many tenders would not be won by local companies but by multinationals.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Weston went on to comment:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If not handled properly, it will create many problems and generate friction between the successful bidders and the losers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr David Merson, the managing director and founder of Queensland developer Mincom, said that he was concerned about the procurement policy, as it could be biased towards multinational policies. An IT consultant, Mr Crisp, in an article also from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  on that same day, was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The smaller specialist IT companies will do well to hone their skills to work better with the big companies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A director at another company was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Australia, this market sector is growing at twice the rate of the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was in response to the actual IT consultancy sector. We are not talking about an industry that is in trouble. We are not talking about a small business sector that is floundering in the market. We are talking about a vital sector. From those quotes, you can see that the perception out there in the industry is that the small business end of that sector is being left out in the cold by this government in favour of the interests of the larger companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take the opportunity to focus more narrowly on a particular occurrence with respect to IT. This does not relate specifically to these information technology cluster contracts; it goes back a bit further than that and relates to the situation that a records management software company&mdash;GMB Research and Development Pty Ltd&mdash;found themselves in as a result of some of the decision making of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Office of Government Information Technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put this in context, remember that we are not talking about government policy impacting on the private sector per se and trying to put in place mechanisms to trigger growth or enhance investment. We are talking about government contracts and we are talking about procurement policy. So this is one of the opportunities the government really has to foster and grow small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue involves the portfolio of the finance minister, who you would think would have more of a grip on the potentiality of the growth of the small business sector. It is interesting to note, I have to say, that Minister Prosser&mdash;who is supposed to be representing small business&mdash;is nowhere to be seen and is deaf to the complaints and the concerns of small business in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyway, let me give the Senate a little background on this issue. GMB are a 100 per cent Australian company. They are profitable, they are debt free and they have had all the government appropriate endorsements and approvals with respect to procurement under the Commonwealth government, and every other state and local government, as I understand it. Their product is used in every state in Australia, the UK, the USA and Canada. They have customers all around the world. But for some reason this company's product was rejected by the Office of Government Information Technology on the grounds that it failed to meet a mandatory requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The company have put out a public statement which opens with the comment, `OGIT opens Australian market to foreign companies and shuts market for (previously successful) Australian companies'. Not only did this  company lose out previously, but also this company have been left off the select tender list with respect to their product. They claim that they are not the only ones&mdash;that these lists are now dominated by firms associated with transnational companies; and that they, along with many other Australian companies who have proven success in this area, have effectively been cut out. GMB have had no other recourse but to take this issue to the Federal Court, and that action is proceeding.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4680"> They believe they have been treated unfairly by OGIT. Not only are they concerned with respect to their case, but also they have raised questions with respect to process in handling that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So here we have an example of where the government has the ability to treat Australian companies with equity. We are asking not for favours, but equity. We find that companies are challenging the government's ability to do that and are claiming that they are being excluded unfairly from that process. What is becoming very clear with respect to information technology in Australia is that, unless you are associated with one of the large transnational companies, you have not got a hope of securing what has in the past constituted&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just like to make a couple of concluding remarks with respect to this motion regarding small business. Quite clearly this government's interest in representing business does not fall into the small business category; it falls into the large business category&mdash;that is becoming obvious. To see that, you only need to look at comments about any changes to taxation that will equate with a reduction in the tax of large business. I will conclude on this point, and I quote from the statement by GMB Research and Development Pty Ltd:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why isn't RecFind, arguably the world's best records management product with a thousand major sites across Australia, New Zealand, the UK and the USA, good enough for OGIT? Doesn't anyone in government care that OGIT is intent on destroying our indigenous software industry? Where is Mr Howard, the champion of small business, now?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1990 the government was presented with a report titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Small business in Australia: challenges, problems and opportunities</EMPHASIS>. Chaired by David Beddall, the report recommended, among other things, the introduction of legislation to protect franchisees from franchisors. What did Labor do about it? Not a damn thing, of course&mdash;not even when the chairman and the author of the recommendations became the minister for small business! In an interview on 20 May 1990, Maxine McKew asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of specific government help for small business, I think your report prepared something like 66 recommendations. How many of those are likely to see the light of day?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell the Senate how we can judge Labor's small business ministry, and that is on its record. And its record is poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994 the Gardini report saw a similar fate to the Beddall report. Once again, Labor ignored recommendations for legislation relating to franchisees. But the backflips  started not in 1990 or 1994 but in fact back in 1986, when Labor dropped two draft bills from the legislative program.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Schacht, in his part in the debate today, promised to support the government to deliver the recommendations of the report through legislation, but why didn't Schacht&mdash;I notice he has had his ears lowered also&mdash;support the earlier recommendations when he was minister for small business?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government is not backing way from anything. Its commitment to small business is on the record. So too is the government's delivery on its commitment. We have given small business capital gains tax relief. Small business owners will be able to gain relief from the capital gains tax when they sell a business to expand and buy a similar business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have reduced Labor's paper burden on small business, giving hardworking Australians more time to get on with their business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have reduced Labor's legacy of high interest rates&mdash;and don't I know it&mdash;crippling to small business. I remind the Senate that four official interest rate cuts have occurred since we came to government 16 months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition certainly should look red&hyphen;faced and uneasy in their chairs over there. All that all bar a few of them have known in life is a union delegateship. They know nothing about small business; they know nothing about the bush.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But wait, there's more, Senator McKiernan. We have scrapped Labor's unfair dismissal laws. Our legislation ensures a fair go all round, for bosses and their workers. But we will never say, `This is as good as it gets.' This government will continue to address the problems facing small business as they continue to recover from one of the most prolonged recessions that Australia has ever had&mdash;the recession that the former Treasurer said we had to have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did not create the problem; but we have taken responsibility for solving it. Our solutions are medium&hyphen; to long&hyphen;term solutions&mdash;not short-term pastings. This government is listening to small business, evident through the small business task force and the microbusiness consultative group. We are not
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> saying it is not tough out there. Of course it is tough. But, when the flowthrough effect of our reform reaches small business, it will be easier&mdash;and hopefully we will also get a shower of rain in the Riverina!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS> is receiving the attention it is due from this government. A response will come within three months from tabling, after full consultation with all parties involved, including federal ministers and the states. However, the opposition is getting all hot under the collar over state responsibilities. The report has 12 recommendations relating to retail tenancy. Regulation here rests with the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the opposition have forgotten what Commonwealth responsibilities are, they are kidding themselves if they think they can manage government. I pity small business and the rest of this country if they manage to con their way back in. The former government failed small business, evident in the very index they are quoting today. In February 1996, the Yellow Pages <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Small business index</EMPHASIS> reported a rating of minus 61 per cent. That is 59 per cent worse than the current index&mdash;59 per cent!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that they are in opposition they are trying to pass themselves off as the champions of small business, the party for the battler. They were too good for the everyday Australian. That is why all their mates were the high&hyphen;flying entrepreneurs of the 1980s who got rich off the back of ordinary Australians. Now all their mates are in the can or overseas hiding, and they are out there looking for some new mates. They will not find them. Our policies, initiatives and reforms are helping the small businesses that Labor neglected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why has the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) been so successful in helping small business? Because, unlike Labor, he knows what it is all about. To hide their own inadequacies, Labor knock a man because he is good at what he does. They knock a man who built a successful business, starting as a mechanic on the work
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4682"> shop floor. Without fail, the opposition knock at any opportunity just for the sake of opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Yellow Pages <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Small business index</EMPHASIS> is a regular favourite. As soon as it is out, there they are spouting the results&mdash;but not, as Senator McGauran said earlier, all of them. Although the information contained in this report is interesting&mdash;and I will get to some of it shortly&mdash;the opposition should not put that much weight on it. I could not agree more with Senator Schacht's comments this afternoon that `the more information the government can get the better'. However, Senator, once again you and the Labor Party fell short when you had the chance, because the index does not survey the small business men and women from the backbone of our economy: the farmers, the members of an industry which includes fishing, farming, forestry and mining, which continues to contribute 75 per cent of Australia's net external earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, again, it is not unusual that Labor ignores the bush. The Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, thinks Canberra is regional Australia. The worn&hyphen;out union delegates opposite think the bush is two trees in their backyard. They know nothing of the bush. Their former leader thought pigs could fly!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray thinks all farmers are rich. He is out of touch with the transfer of wealth that occurred in the 1970s from the bush to the city. I invite him and Senator Collins to spend a week in my state of New South Wales with the farmers who are struggling to educate their kids as El Nino and another bad year approach. That is as far off the mark as the propaganda that says that pastoralists of Australia are all Sultans of Brunei. Unfortunately, the Democrats have got to refer to the Parliamentary Library to learn where the bush is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I find some results of the index worth reporting in this place. The most recent Yellow Pages small index reports that 62 per cent of businesses now expect to expand, as Senator McGauran said earlier. That is good news for small business. Sixty&hyphen;one per cent of businesses expect an improvement in profita
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bility over the next 12 months. That is good news for small business. What is good for small business is good for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To say that Labor can support small business and understand what small business is about when they are entirely composed of a generation of gurus from the union world, a party that applies the same rules to super&hyphen;unions as it does to super&hyphen;business, is absurd and obnoxious to the ordinary Australian.</PARA></SPEECH>

Congratulations on your elevation to the exalted position of Acting Deputy President of the Senate. I am sure you will do a very good job of providing me with the protection I sometimes need from the people opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend Senator Cook for bringing this motion to the chamber tonight. It is a motion that is in a number of parts. It notes the recent Yellow Pages <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Small business index</EMPHASIS>&mdash;not `small index', as Senator Heffernan called it&mdash;and notes also a very important report that has been recently presented in the other place by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology&mdash;a report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS>. It is not only a very useful document now but it will be useful for quite a period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a useful document but it is also a very sad document. For those people who have not had an opportunity to read it, I particularly draw their attention to those stories from those people in small business who have suffered, and suffered dramatically and suffered dreadfully, at the hands of big business, at the hands of the owners of shopping centres where they have tried to run their businesses and from which they have been run out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very unfortunate that the minister who started the inquiry, who gave carriage of the inquiry to the committee, jumped the gun and, only five days after the report was tabled, actually came in and said that he was not going to accept the suggestions and recom
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4683"> mendations contained in the report. It was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 31 May on page 2 of an article by Natasha Bita under the headline `No to Franchise Law Code'. The minister jumped the gun. We know since why the minister has jumped the gun. That has been revealed in the last few weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I get on to that, I do want to correct one of the things that the previous speaker, Senator Heffernan, had to say in talking about Mr Beddall, a previous minister for small business. He indicated that nothing was done about the Beddall report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Challenges, problems and opportunities</EMPHASIS>. That is completely and utterly false. Indeed something was done. The author of the report, who later became Minister Beddall, actually listened to industry, listened to the franchisers, and at their request introduced a voluntary code of conduct. I think you have to give credit where credit is due. The minister of the day did act. After consulting with small business, after consulting with franchisers, he acted on their wishes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A parliamentary committee not led by a member of the Labor Party has now said in a unanimous report that the voluntary code has had its day and it is now time to move on; the franchisees now want protection. It is a very serious recommendation of this report of the committee chaired by Mr Bruce Reid. Unfortunately, the minister has tossed that out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been suggestions around this place that, because we in the opposition and others have asked questions about the minister's declarations of interest, we are actually attacking him. I do not think we are attacking him, either because he is a minister or because he has a successful small business. I had the opportunity of meeting Mr Prosser before either of us came into this place. We were adversaries: I was from the trade union side; he was from business. We were talking about matters of industrial relations. We were able to have reasonable conversations and after the conversations were over we were able to speak, and I suggest that even after this debate is finished Geoff Prosser and I will still be able to exchange civil words.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not to say that we cannot question the information that Mr Prosser puts into his declarations of interest. That is not to say that we cannot, in asking questions about what Mr Prosser declares to the public and declares to the parliament, question the Prime Minister's code of conduct. When I asked the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, a question earlier this week, he interpreted my question as being an attack on Mr Prosser. It was far from an attack on Mr Prosser. Among the questions I asked was this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also a fact that Mr Prosser has failed to fully declare his business interests in the register of members' interests and has retained company directorships which conflict with his public duty, in defiance of the Prime Minister's code?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a simple question, not a personal attack on the individual at all. I did not get a proper answer from Senator Hill but I did get a proper answer from the Prime Minister himself. The Prime Minister's answer was reported the next day in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  and other media. The headline to the article in that paper says, `Howard reallocates retail tenancy role as Opposition turns up the heat.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister, in taking that action that was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on Tuesday 17 June, was agreeing that what was happening previously was not in accord with his particular code of conduct and he, to his commendation, belatedly took action to rectify the situation. Senator Hill, in response to the question, said that he understood that Mr Prosser had maintained his records in the register in accordance with his obligations and in the terms of the register. Attention has been brought to that and how it was noted in the register of members' interests. Apart from the residences that Mr Prosser holds, he did list that he held, in the city of Bunbury, in my home state of Western Australia, various lots. It states `Bunbury&mdash;various lots' and the purpose for which these various lots is listed is `commercial, investment and rental'. It would have been more honest to say that Mr Prosser actually owned three shopping cen tres&mdash;not one, not two, three shopping centres&mdash;which were commercial properties with about 80 tenants in them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4684">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, take action on the same day as I asked my question and reallocate ministerial responsibility for retail tenancy? Why would he do that if Mr Prosser was acting in accord with the Prime Minister's code of conduct? I would suggest that the reason is quite obvious: the Prime Minister, after having his attention drawn to the matter in the press, in the parliament and in other places, realised that, no, Mr Prosser was not acting in accord with the code of conduct. The Prime Minister, after putting down a code of conduct which he expected, and indeed instructed, his ministers to comply with and abide by, realised that one of his ministers was not complying with that particular code of conduct and he did take action to ensure that the code of conduct would be complied with.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I wish to raise concerns that I have with what is happening in the railways at a federal level in this country and I wonder about the impact that this may well have on equal employment opportunity. The proposed sale of a number of railways is of grave concern to many communities. It is leading to a great deal of upset, concern and worry about the future of a number of these places and these communities. There are many small communities in Australia whose livelihood depends on the lifeline of the east&hyphen;west rail link through Broken Hill from Sydney to Perth. It is of major importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The city of Broken Hill has rail services from both Adelaide and Sydney. People may say, `Oh, they can catch a bus.' Having talked to Broken Hill people, and having visited there on many occasions, I know that they do not like the bus service. It is a long bus trip. A bus trip from Broken Hill to Sydney takes more than 12 hours. That is a very long trip. If you get cramps, if you are old, if you need to move around, or if you have young children, it is very disruptive and very hard for people to travel in this way. Even the trip to Adelaide is five to six hours, and that is a lengthy trip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Elderly people also have problems getting on and off buses and moving around buses when the buses are moving. If you are getting on a train at Broken Hill, you walk up a very  gradual ramp straight onto the train. You do not have to climb stairs, you do not have to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4685"> climb high steps, and this is something that many people in Broken Hill have expressed their concerns to me about. It is an issue that I know that the people of Broken Hill will continue to canvass very hard and continue to push very hard for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Broken Hill fear that, if there is the sale of AN, the train may not run through Broken Hill. They fear that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS> may in fact start to run via Melbourne and Adelaide. Whilst we do not have any problems with trains running through Melbourne and Adelaide, people in the western parts of New South Wales will have trouble if they lose a rail service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that line between Parkes and Broken Hill, you have a small community called Ivanhoe. The only all&hyphen;weather land means of access to that town is on the rail. Even the Cobb Highway, which is a main highway in this country that runs to and from Ivanhoe, is a dirt road. It is a black soil road, and, if you get more than about 10 points of rain, it is impassable. So the rail link from Ivanhoe becomes an exceedingly important link for those people to be able to get in and out, to get produce in and out, and to be able to get fresh food and goods and services in and out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their nearest major centre in terms of health care is Broken Hill. The flying doctor operates that service, but the flying doctor is not a taxi service for family members. Therefore, people who have families who are in hospital in Broken Hill will often use the rail link, and particularly so if there has been rain and inclement weather. I think it is a very important issue that people should look at very carefully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the sale and privatisation of companies, one also has to look very carefully to see whether there are going to be any requirements in there to maintain equal opportunity programs. Less control and fewer restrictions can be placed on the organisations, and less encouragement can be given to the organisations that may take over the company to uphold, in a very true and meaningful way, EEO programs and EEO commitments. That is of major importance to people who are in the industry. This is a very important service that runs, and that is provided, to a lot of

<PARA STYLE="Para">The report from the Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Foundations for Australia's future: science and technology in primary schools</EMPHASIS>  is a very important report. Having one of my children at primary school, I have seen the impact of both science and technology on my young daughter, who currently is in year 7. If science is presented in a fair and reasonable way, children react in a spontaneous and positive way to science. I have seen this happen in particular at my daughter's school in more recent times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst there is a growing focus on the issue of technology, this report sounds a bit of an alarm for us, in that I doubt that we are paying the due attention that needs to be paid to our young people in the development of both science and technology. It is pertinent to look at the introduction in the report, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Raising children who are well prepared to cope with life in a future world is not an easy task. There can be little doubt though that their education is a vital component of this upbringing. While the value of the `three Rs' is undeniable, the totality of the knowledge and skills that today's children will require over the course of their lives is difficult for most of us to imagine. Their world will, however, be no less complex than ours, or the role of science and technology in their daily lives any the less significant.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That encapsulates the dilemma that our society is in today. Whilst there is a focus on the three R's, there is a real need for our young children in their formative years to develop an understanding of science and technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not read this report in its entirety, but I have read enough to understand the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4686"> effort that has been put in by the various participants. In its main finding, it came to the conclusion that there is a strong level of support among school principals, parents, teachers and children for primary science and technology education. On page 11, in table 1, the report refers to `Principals' and parents' goals for primary science and technology education'. It has ranked in order a number of categories that the committee believes should be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look at the priorities. In the top three, it lists: understanding scientific or technological concepts; developing an inquiring mind; and developing problem solving skills. Those three areas rank as the top for primary science and technology education. To a lesser degree in rank, it lists: learning about scientific or technological achievements; encouragement to be innovative; link/apply science or technology to everyday life; and gain knowledge and skills as a basis for future citizenship. So the report focuses on developing that understanding which, I believe, is so important in giving our children a very basic but, nonetheless, good education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the disturbing features of the report, though, was that it was found that there was a disparity between the in-principle support for science and technology and that which occurs in practice. Firstly, while some people are fairly good in talking about the need for this, there is a reluctance on the part of some to do anything about it. Secondly, only four per cent of teaching time in a weekly timetable was found to be devoted to both science and technology. There are gaps; there is a long way to go. This report should be taken seriously and it should be something that people pay attention to for the betterment of our young people.</PARA>

It was interesting that out of this fund a substantial amount of assistance was given to those widows or dependants of the soldiers who died on duty in the Black Hawk accident in June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst this fund was set up to assist those in the army who may be in some form of need or suffering some form of hardship, this is an extraordinarily marvellous achievement that has been made as a result of this fund being in existence.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a report brought about by some people because they felt that the response they had got from Australia's consular officials had been less than they desired and expected. Some of these involved deaths of family members in circumstances that were traumatic, that were highly publicised, including the Wilson case and a number of others, that were very sad and that caused the families a lot of grief. It was also hard committee work because, in questioning these people about their concerns to come to some conclusions, we had to not aggravate or intensify their upset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a very good report. It is a unanimous report of the committee. There were some recommendations and findings on which some members would have placed a different weight of emphasis, but it is a very good and comprehensive report.</PARA>

When we called for submissions we found that not all of the families wished to make submissions because they did not feel that they had any problems with the assistance they had been given by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We also found that families ranged from being antagonistic towards the department to being very grateful for the assistance that the department had also given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everybody needs to recognise that the death of a close member of a family is a very painful and traumatic experience in the best of times. When it occurs overseas and when
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it occurs in circumstances where reports appear in the media for weeks on end, it must be doubly or trebly more painful for those families. They cannot grieve privately because they do not know what is going on. It must be an extremely difficult time for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that I hope come out of this is that some mechanism will be set up, though not necessarily by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, because I do not think they are the people to do it. But civil authorities at the state levels must look at how they provide support to grieving families, particularly in the circumstances that we heard about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also heard of some of the expectations that the  community has of what types of services Foreign Affairs should be supplying. We often get into strife as members of parliament for being frequent travellers around the world. But I am sure that most of you here have heard stories from foreign posts about some of the phone calls that they have had, with people saying, `Please help me; I'm at a border. I haven't got a visa, but you can come and fix me up.' There are totally unrealistic expectations on the part of Australians travelling overseas as what our consular officials are able to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very important for people to realise that when they go overseas they cease to be the subject of Australian law and become the subject of the law that operates in the country they are in. In some of the countries that they choose to travel in&mdash;particularly some of the adventurous people&mdash;the laws are very vague, the laws may be open to local interpretation and the laws may not be upheld.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other areas in this world, whether we like it or not, that are trouble spots&mdash;where there is instability, where there are rebels, where there is fighting, where people are taken hostage, where people are murdered and where the price of life is very low. People in other areas sometimes do not place the same sanctity on life as we do and as those in the Western world do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was very much the case with the Wilsons&mdash;David Wilson and a national from  France and a national from England were captured by the Khmer Rouge and ended up
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4688"> being killed. We only have to go back and look at what Pol Pot did in the killing fields. I for one would not want to ever meet a Khmer Rouge fighter on their territory, because for them life is not very precious. They choose to kill their own people in cold blood, in large numbers and for very trivial crimes. They do not place the same sanctity on life as Australians do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is something that people need to be conscious of. On occasions, people visit places where this is the situation. They have to be aware that if they get into trouble in some areas there is very little anybody can do to get them out, particularly if they are visitors. If they have lived in an area or worked with a non-government organisation and have built up some very close personal relations with local people, then it may well be a different situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During this inquiry, shortly before the Wilson kidnapping, we heard that there had been an American female NGO taken hostage and she was released. But she had been working with an organisation out in the field for some considerable time and was known and liked by the local people. They were able, at the local level, to exert more power and more pressure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hostage cases raise the issue: do you pay a ransom or do you not pay a ransom? That is a very hard question for people to have to answer. It is even harder for the families of people who may well be the hostages. Very difficult decisions have to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Getting away from those sorts of traumatic times, it is vitally important that people remember that the services that can be provided by Australian consular officials are limited by what can be afforded. They are limited also by the position and the placement of consular offices. We do not have consular offices in every country in the world. We have developed a very close relationship with Canada and actually have official reciprocal representation agreements so that in a number of places Australia provides consular support for Australian nationals and Canadian nationals, and vice versa. We also get a lot of support in some areas from the UK consular
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> offices, and in a number of other places the US one helps as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also deals with child custody and the Hague convention. It is a great pity that, with an increasing number of breakdowns in marriages, we see an increasing number of abductions of children&mdash;children being removed out of Australia and being brought into Australia. Australia has signed the Hague convention, which means there are reciprocal treaties that are recognised by the 40-odd countries that have signed it. But many more countries need to sign that Hague convention so that children can be returned to the jurisdiction under which the original orders were given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a need also for people who are travelling  overseas to recognise the need for insurance. If you cannot afford the insurance you cannot afford to travel. There is a need also to look at how the information in travel advices is spread around, and there are some recommendations relating to that. I suspect, on occasions, that some travel agents&mdash;maybe not very many, but a few&mdash;are not terribly fussed about making sure that the general public know about travel advices because they are in the business of selling trips and tours to places and these travel advices could well be warning people about the dangers of going to a place. The Internet is being used. They are going to be using more&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill has two primary purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is to introduce new arrangements by which agencies are able to obtain warrants authorising the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> interception of telecommunications for the investigation of serious criminal offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill's second principal object is to strengthen arrangements for dealing with police corruption.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The interception of telecommunications by law enforcement agencies, and subsequent dealing with intercepted information, are regulated by the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That act provides a detailed scheme of control designed to protect the privacy and confidentiality of communications passing over the Australian telecommunications system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A general rule of our society is that a communication of this kind is private to the participants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Intrusion into a communication, even by the government's law enforcement agencies, is subject to strict control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Interceptions can only be carried out by declared Commonwealth and State law enforcement agencies and only under the authority of a warrant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present interception warrants may be issued by an eligible judge of a court created by this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An eligible judge is one who has been nominated by the responsible Minister after having consented to perform the function.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statutory requirement for individual consent underlines that issuing a warrant is an administrative power conferred on a judge as a designated person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes to provide for categories of persons, in addition to judges, who may be authorised to issue warrants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments are necessary because the eligible judges of the Federal Court have decided that they should no longer perform this function.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand the judges have expressed a quite proper concern that the workload involved should not interfere with the performance of their judicial duties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, there is a more fundamental issue involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The High Court has recently indicated that the use of judges as designated officials to perform certain administrative functions may be incompatible with the judicial function as it can undermine public confidence in the independence and integrity of the Judiciary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The High Court has also specifically advised some judges against agreeing to issue interception warrants because of the risk that the judge may subsequently be involved in a related proceeding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will confer the authority to issue interception warrants on certain members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal who are nominated for this purpose by the responsible Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The potential pool of nominees would be the Deputy Presidents and full-time Senior Members, as well as those
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4690"> part-time Senior Members and Members (all of whom are part-time) who have legal qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This new arrangement takes into account the special character of the authority to issue an interception warrant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the issuing process is to provide an opportunity, before the event, for the conflicting interests of the state and an individual to be assessed, so that the individual's right to privacy will be affected only where the appropriate statutory standard has been met and the needs of law enforcement are demonstrably superior.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For such a process to be meaningful, the person making the assessment must be capable of doing so in a neutral and impartial manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that the specified members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal have both the independence and experience necessary for this role.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, an individual will only be given the authority to issue warrants after he or she is nominated by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be an opportunity, before an eligible person is nominated, for consultation with the President of the Tribunal concerning their experience and background.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that the new arrangement set out in the bill will maintain the integrity of the warrant issuing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should also point out that the amendments do not in any way alter the provisions which permit judges to issue warrants should their views change at some time in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill introduces similar new arrangements for issuing listening device warrants to Commonwealth law enforcement agencies under the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and the Customs Act 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These warrants are also issued at present by federal judges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the provisions in the bill that are directed against the serious problem of police corruption.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most significantly, the bill contains a number of provisions relating to the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission has recently been established as a permanent authority to continue the work of the Wood Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators will be aware that the Wood Royal Commission uncovered disturbing instances of corruption and other serious police misconduct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth supports the government of New South Wales in its efforts to excise the cancer of corruption from within its police service and is ready to assist in providing the new Commission with appropriate and effective powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Experience has shown that covert surveillance is one of the most powerful investigative tools for uncovering and prosecuting police misconduct.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 to permit the Commission to receive and use intercepted information originally obtained by other law enforcement agencies where the information relates to a matter the Commission may investigate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments also open the way for a declaration to be made which will permit the Commission to apply for warrants on its own behalf once the Attorney-General, as the responsible Minister, is satisfied that the statutory pre-conditions of a declaration have been fulfilled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments do not involve any effective widening of interception powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The responsibilities of the Police Integrity Commission for investigating police misconduct have generally been transferred to it from the Independent Commission Against Corruption and the New South Wales Police Service. Both these latter agencies are already able to apply for interception warrants for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill further supports the Police Integrity Commission in other ways. Amendments to the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 will give the Commission, as well as the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, access to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre's database of reportable transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, amendments to the Customs Act will permit the Australian Police and the National Crime Authority to communicate information those agencies obtain by means of a listening device directly to the Commission where the information relates to the Commission's functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without this amendment, the Commonwealth agencies would only be able to pass listening device information about police corruption to the Commission via the New South Wales Police Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several of the amendments deal with more general aspects of police misconduct. The bill will permit the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to use intercepted information in deciding whether to appoint, re-appoint or dismiss a member or staff member of the AFP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment is a response to a decision in the Federal Court to the effect that the Commissioner was not permitted to rely on intercepted informa tion relating to corruption by an AFP officer in a decision not to re-appoint that officer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that position to be inconsistent with the Commissioner's responsibilities to keep the AFP free of corruption and the power given to the Commissioner over appointments within the AFP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also contains an equivalent provision in relation to other police services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to other amendments.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4691"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will permit intercepted information to be given in evidence in three categories of proceedings that relate to the commission of prescribed offences. One category provides for an application for bail that relates to a prosecution for a prescribed offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment is a response to a decision by the Court of Appeal of New South Wales in the case of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Director of Public Prosecutions v Serratore </EMPHASIS> which held that a bail application is not part of a related prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also permit intercepted information to be given in evidence in applications for restraining orders made under Commonwealth and Sate proceeds of crime legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effectiveness of this legislation, particularly in relation to drugs offences, depends on the ability of prosecuting authorities to obtain orders preventing assets from being dealt with pending the outcome of related criminal proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment is to clarify the legislative position following the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Serratore</EMPHASIS>  decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third category of proceedings is a coroner's inquest if the coroner considers the subject of the inquiry, for example a suspicious death, may have been caused by the commission of a prescribed offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose is to avoid a situation where a coroner is prevented from receiving evidence that may be vital to the coroner's determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the bill contains a number of other minor amendments related to the use of intercepted information and record keeping obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments have no significant financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Senator Minchin) is saying no, so he will be able to clear that up for me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems I can see with this provision is that the South Australian election, which is coming up, could be running almost parallel with the election for members to the constitutional convention, which is due to take place in about August, and it could be that we are going to disqualify some people who want to stand for state election and who are waiting on a state election to be declared. Moreover, it says that a person's nomination is not valid unless they declare that they do not intend to be a candidate in any other election. So you have to make a declaration of intentions, which I think is a very difficult thing to do. The minister is indicating that he can clear up that point, so I will let him do that before I continue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate Senator Brown's sensitivity to my leaping up and down. I can clear that up. The reference to `election' requires you to look at the definition of election in the bill, where it states that `election means an election for a state or territory under this act', which is the normal convention of interpretation. We are talking about an election under this act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this section is designed to do is prevent people nominating in every state and territory. So, if you nominate, you nominate in only one state or territory for the election governed by this act, and the only election governed by this act is an election for delegates to the convention. So it does not prevent a candidate for any other electoral process, or any future election, from running; it simply prevents people from nominating in more than one jurisdiction for this particular election, as defined by the act itself.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would ask the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) to look at this clause when the legislation goes from here back to the House of Representatives to make sure that it is quite clear&hyphen;cut that it is the intention that it should refer only to people who might intend to stand in a number of states and territories for the constitutional convention and that it does not prevent somebody who might want to stand for an election, if one should occur in South Australia, from standing for the constitutional convention at the same time.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I view this as one of the most important amendments coming forward in this debate. It is to provide for a plebiscite to be held at the time of the election for candidates to the Constitutional Convention. Just to reiterate, that election is likely to be held in August or September for the Constitutional Convention which is mooted to be in December.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it stands, the Constitutional Convention is going to be a meeting of half government  appointed delegates and half elected delegates. It is not going to have direction. There is no direction in this legislation as to what it should be discussing. What we take from that is that, at the outset, its direction will be given to it by the government and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). We have failed to get up an amendment which would have left it to the convention itself, under those circumstances, to determine its schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much better than it be given direction by the government is that it be given direction by
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4695"> the people of Australia. We think it is logical and sensible, seeing we are holding a national election&mdash;and this committee has successfully amended this legislation so far to ensure that everybody votes&mdash;that after voting for the candidates of their choice the Australian electors tick a box saying whether or not they want an Australian to be head of state. This would mean that the convention would have a direction from the Australian people about whether or not a republic was wanted in 1997. The opinion polls increasingly and resoundingly say `yes' to that question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens are concerned that, as this legislation stands, there will be a lot of time and effort and millions of dollars wasted on this convention as people debate the question of whether we should retain the monarchy or move to having an Australian as head of state. What a plebiscite would do is simply indicate to the people gathering at that convention that the Australian people do want an Australian as head of state; or it may be they will vote in the opposite direction. But if we take the polls, they indicate that an Australian is wanted as head of state, the convention can then get on with the business of determining what sort of republic it will be. This is sensible, logical and expeditious. It is taking account of the direction this nation is going in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it is, the government is going to hold a plebiscite but it is going to be after the Constitutional Convention. It is very likely it will lead to a referendum further down the line. We say that we should have the plebiscite first. We should have this convention working from the solid basis of knowing that the Australian people indeed do want an Australian as head of state as this nation of ours moves into the next millennium. It all seems so obvious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot will be said about the cost of holding plebiscites, the cost of holding conventions and the cost of holding multiple elections over this business of determining how we move to a republic. I do not think there is much other than a very broad acceptance of the fact in this nation that we are moving to a republic.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> So let us get on with it. Let us have the people have their say at the outset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We Greens believe a lot more trust should be put in the people. That is why we believe that all the candidates to this convention should be elected. That is why we believe that this convention should be able to set its timetable. Moreover, that is why we believe that a plebiscite, which would be of  minimal cost but have a mighty positive effect on the outcome of that convention, should be held in conjunction with this election. Let us have the Australian people, at the outset, have their say. I can tell the government this: the Australian people will feel much more involved. They will feel that they are having a say from the outset. They will take this convention much more to be theirs if they are given the opportunity to vote yes or no for a republic at a plebiscite in August when this election is held.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot understand how, with all the aforethought that has gone into this legislation and with all the aforethought that has gone into this process, the government is not itself legislating for this plebiscite to be held now. It is almost as if it is frightened of the Australian people. It is almost as if it is frightened to put its toe in the water of our republican future. Let us get on with it. Let us give the people a say. Let us have this convention determine what sort of republic we are going to have; how we institute an Australian as head of state in the coming few years; and how we remould, as best possible, using this historic opportunity, Australian democracy freed of the last remnants of its colonial connection with Britain and with this anachronism of having somebody from another country as our head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that all parties in this chamber should support this amendment. It is thoroughgoing commonsense. It even makes economic sense&mdash;it makes dollars and cents sense. But, above all, it draws the Australian people into this historic process from the outset, and I cannot think of a better thing to do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not someone who frequently calls for referendums. I am certainly not a fan of citizen initiated referendums, mainly because they can be used as a tool for powerful and well&hyphen;resourced lobby groups to push a minority view over a majority view. However, what Senator Brown is asking for is an indicative plebiscite, something which can give a direction in terms of whether or not the majority of Australians wish to have an Australian as a head of state. That gives a great potential for freedom within the ongoing process. It means that the people involved can then free themselves up to allow themselves to go back to the community and talk to people about what kind of republic they want, if that is what is  decided in relation to a plebiscite. If the answer is, `No, not yet', then there is more work to be done within the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the answer is yes, maybe we have the ability to bring in the excitement that I believe is in the community about what kind of Australia we want to have to go into the next century. Maybe we will not be held down by a wish to decide whether or not a minimalist solution is the only thing possible within the discussions here. Maybe this gives us an opportunity to open out the level of community input on this issue instead of being frightened of what the community might say. It certainly is something that as many people as possible should be involved in. And, because the Senate has now deemed that the election should be open, democratic and compulsory, that means, basically, that everybody will have a say. Why not use that opportunity to get as clear an indication as it is possible to get of what Australians want for the future and then work in the best way towards achieving that?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition does not support the proposal moved by Senator Brown. Our view is that a plebiscite is the way to go. We put that proposal before&mdash;and to&mdash;the last election. We still maintain that it is the appropriate way to involve all Australians in the process right from the start, but we realise
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the proposal before us from the Greens runs contrary to the proposal put forward by the government at the last election&mdash;a proposal the government is keen to pursue. The government went to the election with their proposal for a constitutional convention without a plebiscite and, given the result of that election, there is some responsibility on us to look at the government's proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also think that meshing both together would not be the appropriate way to go. In the past we have not adopted a proposal to mesh a constitutional convention and a plebiscite together. We have been of the view that a plebiscite can perform a special and particular function but, after a plebiscite is held to get a reflection of the will of the Australian people, a process can be developed, based on the mechanisms of this parliament, to ensure the refinement of proposals to put to a subsequent referendum, with the participation of the Australian people and of all sides of this parliament. So we do not see Senator Brown's proposal as the appropriate way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We expect the government to deliver on their Constitutional Convention. I know that we have had the odd threat in the last day or so about what the government would do if they did not get the totality of their package through unamended, but we are talking about an issue that will not go away. Although we have good reason to doubt the government's bona fides as to whether they want constitutional change&mdash;the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in particular has indicated that he does not see the need for change now&mdash;we are of the view that the issue will continue to stay with us. For instance, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> this morning made it very clear what its message to the government was when it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yesterday's Senate vote is a reminder to the Government that the whole process should be fair, consistent and credible. It should not be used as an excuse to abandon the convention.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We also hold very firmly to those sentiments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also remind the government that this is not just an issue for the moment; it is one that is of concern to the community and to individual Liberal Party members. A copy of a survey of Liberal Party members&mdash;conducted in Queensland recently by Senator John
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4697"> Herron&mdash;arrived at my office this afternoon. Senator Herron says, `An identical survey has been conducted in South Australia, Victoria, WA and Tasmania by four of my Senate colleagues.' It is interesting that only one in three Liberal Party leadership members in that survey has a very firm view that Australia should stay a constitutional monarchy. That is a mere four per cent increase over the last four years&mdash;Senator Herron compares this 1997 survey to a 1993 survey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of those in the Liberal Party leadership who believe Australia should become a republic, there has been a fourfold increase from 1993 to 1997&mdash;from four per cent to 15 per cent. In terms of those who think Australia should only become a republic if the Constitutional Convention demonstrates clear benefit, those tending very strongly towards supporting a republic, that is another 19 per cent. So the party of government is divided and the government, if it were to pull the plug on a constitutional convention, would not be able to pull the plug on the move and the road towards a republic. That would be ongoing. A sign of that, as I say, is the support within the coalition government parties for a move towards a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is one of history's ironies that, while we are here debating the next important step to take to take Australia on the road to a republic, the Prime Minister is in England with the Queen, rusting himself onto the monarchy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Anyway, I was not intending to talk at length here. The point is that, while the Prime Minister is there in London yapping about like one of the Queen's corgis, I am sure he will tell the Queen about the Constitutional Convention proposal. What he also needs to tell her is that some 67 per cent of Australians support the republic and have done so for some time. I think he also needs to tell her that there is a solid body of support for a republic for Australia within his own party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister might tell the Queen how he and Senator Minchin have cleverly designed this proposal to keep Australia under the monarchy for the foreseeable future, but he should not just present one side of the story. He should ask her what her view would be if we were to become a republic. I think, as Senator Collins said, in one way or another she has given her view. If the Prime Minister were to ask her that question, I think he would find there would be very little resistance from the monarchy about Australia becoming a republic. It is indeed a matter for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think he would also find that, if he were to ask her, he would probably find that he wants her more than she actually wants us&mdash;that he is a greater supporter of a monarchy for Australia than the monarch herself. I think it is important to keep that in perspective in terms of the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister could also ask the Queen&mdash;given Senator Harradine's earlier interjection&mdash;why, as head of state for Australia, she is not supporting Australia in the test tonight. That is a fair question to ask. Why isn't she sweating on Mark Taylor's return to form, the fitness of Gillespie and Blewett or the form of Shane Warne? The fact is that her priorities are not ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can probably best see that in Hong Kong at the moment. Once again, we are here  contemplating this proposal. Very soon our Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) will be in Hong Kong. I hope he will not be taking lessons from the Chinese there&mdash;in that he fully appoints a body to make decisions for our future as they are doing. If there are any

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have absolutely no idea what 90 per cent of Senator Bolkus's speech had to do with the amendment before the chair&mdash;which is to provide that there be a plebiscite&mdash;and I will not indulge myself by responding to most of his assertions, ill-

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would mention in passing that, regrettably, the Greens have not provided us with an estimate of the cost of this proposal. They apparently make no estimate of the costs of their proposals that they bring to this chamber. But, as the government, we are responsible for these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a $7 million additional cost if you have a plebiscite together with the election for delegates. So with the up to $20 million extra which the Senate has added to the cost of this process, there would be another $7 million with the plebiscite and we have not yet got to public funding. So we are already up to $62 million for this election as a result of proposals put by the opposition parties&mdash;in this case, the Greens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think this is putting the cart before the horse. The government was elected overwhelmingly to implement its policy. The party that went to the election saying, `We are not proposing to turn Australia into a republic,' was elected overwhelmingly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans, of course. The policy was that we have the convention. Then, depending on the result of the convention, we would have either an
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4699"> indicative plebiscite or a referendum by the end of the year 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we set down what we thought was a logical process. That is, the nation would discuss this very significant issue&mdash;an issue about which a lot of Australians do not necessarily have a view or about which they have mixed views because they see arguments from both sides&mdash;and that would be debated in the forum of a convention. If the convention reached a consensus in favour of a particular republican model, we as a government would undertake to facilitate that going to a referendum. If there was no such consensus, we would undertake to put a range of options to the people in the form of a plebiscite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I add that we do not agree that the plebiscite question should be whether you think Australia should have an Australian head of state, what we regard as a facile question. Even former Labor leader Bill Hayden regarded himself, I think quite properly, as the Australian head of state in wearing the mantle of Governor-General. So whatever your views, there are a lot of Australians who believe that the Governor-General is the head of state and the Governor-General is an Australian. So that is not, in our view, the appropriate question in any event to fairly and reasonably put to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, for the reasons of cost, for the reasons of sensible process and for the reasons that the whole convention idea is to enable Australians to be exposed to the arguments for and against in the sort of forum that the convention provides before they come to cast a vote on this thing, I think it is sensible. The Senate has already decided that you are going to force people to vote for either monarchist or republican delegates to the convention. But now the Greens want to force people to vote on what we regard is the quite facile question of whether you want Australia to have an Australian head of state. Therefore, we reject the amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be quite happy for the government to move to have the question changed from whether or not people want an Australian head of state to whether or not they want a republic. The honourable senator knows that that is irrelevant to the point of giving Australians a say as to whether or not they want a republic in the run&hyphen;up to this convention. It is not beyond our wit and wisdom to have a fair, clear question which says to Australians, `Say "yes" or "no" as to whether you want a republic.' That is what this plebiscite is about and that is what yours is going to be about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Senator Margetts is correct. The government is not being fair dinkum about this convention. It is not being fair dinkum about taking the people into account in the fullest way possible, otherwise it would have them electing the delegates to the convention and have them involved from the outset by having them say whether or not they want a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What seems stranger still is the Labor Party's viewpoint on this. First of all, Senator Bolkus, for whom I have the greatest respect, says, `Our view is that there should be a plebiscite. It is just that we are going to vote against this proposal that there should be a plebiscite, which is our view.' Then he goes on to say, `Given the result of the election, the government had a policy that they'll have a convention. We accede to that.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every hour of the day in here Senator Bolkus and the opposition are taking on the government over the policies it is implementing, whether or not they be election promises. But when it gets to this critical question of the republic, the opposition have gone into reverse. I do not know whether it is an aversion which comes from the feeling that Mr Keating may have gone a bit strongly on it and it did not do them well; but, whatever it is, there is a great contradiction in the opposition's viewpoint on this.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are in here to take on the government in a positive way as far as possible to innovate and to make things better for the Australian people. That is what this amendment does. It says to Australians, `You give us an indication from the outset and you make this convention worth while.' I can tell you what this convention is going to do without the plebiscite. First of all, there is going to be a $50 million or $60 million election exercise. Secondly, a convention will come out of that. If that convention is based on the word `consensus' in the way in which Senator Minchin has meant it, there is going to be about a fifty-fifty or a two&hyphen;one split between those who favour a republic and those who do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Goodness gracious me; are we going to spend $62 million to find out what the split in that convention is going to be? I feel we are&mdash;instead of taking this opportunity at a 10 per cent extra cost to make that convention mean something, because it actually has a direction from the Australian people to work on what sort of republic we want. That is wise spending of money. That is a logical way to go. That is a sensible way to take the Australian people into account in this issue, on which every Australian either has a point of view or is developing a point of view, but about which everyone knows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition viewpoint, no less than the government viewpoint, is addled on this. I am trying to bring some commonsense into the process as well as give the Australian people the vote they want at the outset. There is going to be massive publicity about an election in late winter and early spring. People are going to be asked to go to the polling booths&mdash;or, as the government would have had it, to fill out their postal ballot form&mdash;to vote for candidates for a convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is going to be a process of frustration because they are going to be denied answering at the outset the question they want to answer: whether or not they want an Australian as our head of state; whether or not&mdash;to put the question differently, and I would be quite accepting of this&mdash;they want a republic.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats proposed originally that there should be an indicative plebiscite because it was our belief that that would have been extremely helpful in developing the process of advancing towards a republic by the turn of the century. However, that view was rejected by government and the government decided to introduce its Constitutional Convention proposal. All six parties represented in this chamber have accepted that process and are participating in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For as long as there was a voluntary postal ballot facing us, we continued to have doubts about that process. But, now that we have a compulsory attendance ballot, we are of the view that, depending of course&mdash;and it is a crucial dependence&mdash;on the way in which the tickets are titled, the compulsory attendance ballot will itself deliver the equivalent of an indicative plebiscite because, when the Australian republican movement puts its delegates up, nobody who votes for that will be a monarchist and, when the Australian monarchist movement puts its members up, nobody who votes for them will be a republican. So,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to a large extent, we believe that the votes which will attach to the tickets that come up will provide for the indicative plebiscite idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point is that we are aware that there is a danger that the government may try to find a mechanism to squirm out of the changed bill. We hope it is all bluster and threat, but one thing we do not want to do is to add additional cost. Their sole justification for squirming out of the changed bill will be on the grounds of increased costs. We have already heard from Senator Minchin extraordinarily inflated mathematics. I would remind listeners that the downside increase in the cost of running the convention on the basis of the changed bill is between $7 million and $9 million and not between $18 million and $20 million. If it suits Senator Minchin to push the higher figure, it suits me to push the lower figure&mdash;and the truth may well be somewhere in between.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I point out to Senator Margetts and Senator Brown that we as the Australian Democrats strongly support the idea of an indicative plebiscite but we believe that the compulsory attendance ballot will now fulfil much of that intention. It is our intention to barrack as hard as we can for anybody who has `republican' against their name on the ticket. Accordingly, we will oppose the Greens' amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator for the Democrat viewpoint, but again it falls on the premise that the convention will take note of and be guided by the election of delegates in the same way as it would be guided by a very simple vote on whether or not there should be a republic. Senator Murray might reflect on the fact that half the members are going to be appointed to this convention. His argument would be much stronger if all members were being elected, but it is very much weakened by the fact that that is not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to get an equivalent indication from the compulsory vote being applied to the election of delegates, why don't we just clear the air and give people a straight vote?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the things that I really love about Australia is that at times ratbaggery has come to be a fine art form.

And I do not think it is the right thing to do to suggest it is going to be a nice little controlled outcome which says yes or no. It may just possibly still be a useful discussion that may lead to something else&mdash;that is, it may lead to more of the community being involved in discussions at a later date and then working later on into something beyond an indicative plebiscite.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a very long amendment which, very simply, provides for public funding as in normal elections, so that citizens who stand for election, or the groups behind them or the groups with them, will get a return if they are successful in the same terms as in normal election campaigns. The Greens are simply following through with our belief that this election, all the way through, should mirror elections normally held for the Senate. That will be the case with the amendments the committee has made in just about every respect, except for the public funding component.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the amendment should be supported because groups in the community who are not well heeled ought to be able to take part with the prospect of some return to them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government obviously&mdash;I guess because we did not put it
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4705"> in our bill&mdash;does not support the proposition that there be public funding. I think there is a general understanding on both sides now that public funding and disclosure are part of the normal parliamentary electoral arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators will have noticed that, in their report on the 1996 election, the government members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters&mdash;of which I am one&mdash;did not propose to remove or destroy the whole base of public funding. Therefore, we accept it as part of our arrangements for parliamentary elections. But in this case, where we are electing delegates to a convention&mdash;they will be there for only 10 days&mdash;we did not think it was a responsible appropriation of taxpayers' money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens are proposing the $1.50 that is set out in the Electoral Act. That could amount to up to another $15 million on top of the $60 million&mdash;or the $62 million, I think&mdash;we are up to already. I concede that part of your proposition is to ensure that payments are not to exceed expenditure, but you would have to have very significant administrative arrangements to require the disclosure of all expenditure to ensure that you had accurate records of everybody's expenses. So all candidates would have to comply with all the normal requirements in relation to disclosure of all their expenditure in order that that provision can be properly policed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On balance, we do not think it appropriate. What we have done is provide that there be a $1,000 tax deduction, which is the tax deduction provided for local government candidates. We think that that is fair. We also propose that delegates' expenses in the form of airfares and accommodation in attending the convention for the whole 10 days would be met. On balance, we thought that that was appropriate in light of having a cost effective arrangement.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We support the thrust of what the Greens are doing. Indeed, the rest of the amendments from the opposition and the Democrats are basically trying to do the same

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this particular case, I think we have to go a little behind the scenes and look at why. We have to look at why there is public funding and why it is put in place. It is basically put there to reduce the potential problems of parties relying heavily on donations, particularly from business and from people who believe that they may be buying influence. It is for that reason that the Democrats are not able to support this. We do not believe the same circumstances exist in this particular poll, particularly as the minister has said that we are looking at people basically being in their position for 10 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So looking at the type of election that we are having and the reasons for public funding, the Democrats cannot agree with this particular amendment. However, as I said, we support the basic thrust of where the amendments are going, and that is to not further confuse the public with different voting systems and different tickets.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make the point, in response to Senator Minchin, that the Greens have always stood for public funding to be a reimbursement of the amount that was spent. The Greens vigorously opposed the change, when it was made in this place, that the parties standing for election get reimbursed $1.50 regardless of whether they spend it or not, because we understood that was a simple way of getting the parties out of the red themselves&mdash;taking public money that was not spent on an election campaign and shovelling it into their coffers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that the opposition will not be proceeding with amendments 60 to 62, 68, 69, 70 and 71. I foreshadow that I will be moving opposition amendments 66 and 67. This proposal in amended form seeks to establish a process for the selection of the 36 persons appointed to participate in the Constitutional Convention as community representatives. We have probably been through most of these arguments before in the course of this debate. We do not think the government's process to date is one that is, in any sense of the word, democratic. It is not transparent and, as such, it needs to be examined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government have sought to do here is to appoint 36 persons to participate in the name of the community, and it has chosen to select them themselves. There are quite a number of inherently fundamental problems with this sort of approach. First of all, in the nomination process, a number of organisations were asked to nominate. In the Labor Party, of course, Kim Beazley was one of those. But we do not have an idea as to which organisations were asked. The process, therefore, was one that, in respect of such organisations, was in the dark. People had a capacity to self&hyphen;nominate but it was only in the last 36 to 48 hours before the official closure of self&hyphen;nominations that people actually realised that they had a capacity to self&hyphen;nominate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite that, some 850 Australians at least, I gather, took the opportunity to self&hyphen;nominate. We do not know how many people of what background did either self&hyphen;nominate or were nominated. A lot of Australians missed out, and a lot of Australians missed out because of lack of information. Once again, there was no sense of democracy or full participation in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gets worse. We do not know who has conducted the selection process, we do not know what criteria were used for the selection process, and, of course, we still do not know who was appointed. When you talk about an issue like the republic, where the will of the Australian people in continuous numbers of polls has reflected 66 to 70 per cent support for the republic, you would hope that the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> persons appointed to participate by the government would represent that sort of will, that sort of expression of opinion, in the Australian public. We have no indication as to whether that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So all in all it is a pretty undemocratic process, one where the government seeks to appoint 36 people in the dark, under a process which we know absolutely nothing about. If that commitment by the Prime Minister to involve all the Australian people at all stages of the process meant anything, this process should have been much more transparent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think the best way to go is to set up a joint committee of 12 members of the parliament and not only give that committee the job of selecting such 36 people&mdash;and doing so with a two&hyphen;thirds majority of that committee to ensure there is a degree of cooperation, consultation and bipartisanship&mdash;but also charge it with the responsibility of setting down the procedures and processes for the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to those procedures and processes, the government has told us that they will work them out and they will tell us. I would like to warn the government that when you set up a body like this and when you get 152 people together, they actually have a life of their own in terms of what they would do with the processes and procedures of such a convention. It would be best for the orderly conduct of such a convention that there be a degree of bipartisanship in the formulation of those rules and regulations. It would be in the government's interest to pick up this sort of recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will move amendments 66 and 67. We are not going to move amendments 68 and 69. Those amendments relate to the number of delegates to be appointed by the states and territories. Nor will we move amendments 70 and 71, which give the power to the joint committee to appoint a chair of the convention, since that appointment has already been made. We do say that 66 and 67 should be proceeded with. In recognition of an amend ment carried earlier, I will seek to move 67 in an amended form with deletion of 169A(2)(c)&mdash;that is, to delete from the joint committee's duties the approval of the state

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment has been withdrawn. Nevertheless, I would say that the government was not intending to support the Labor proposition. The Labor amendment proposed the introduction in this bill of the very clause of the Electoral Act which Labor quite extraordinarily introduced and then withdrew in 1984. It never had an opportunity to work. So we thought it was a bit rich for Labor now to propose that it be part of this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We agree with Labor that the wording of that clause of 1984 is not the right one. As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I have long championed the cause of introducing into the Commonwealth Electoral Act the South Australian provision, which does work, is effective and is properly worded. I hope that our government will bring to this chamber a proposition to introduce that provision into the Electoral Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this case, in the spirit of the Democrats, we were operating on a basis of wanting to apply the provisions of the Electoral Act, unless absolutely necessary to change them. The Electoral Act does not currently provide any more than the misleading or deceptive publications provisions that are in this bill. The provisions in the Electoral Act now regarding misleading or deceptive publications are carried over into this bill. We accept that they have a restrictive interpretation and application but because we do not have in the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Electoral Act yet the sort of South Australian provision that I hope one day will be there, we felt that, for the sort of arguments that the Democrats have been putting up in other amendments, in the case of this election, we would not propose to put that in.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will precede my answers to those questions with some general remarks about the proposition before the chair&mdash;that is, that the parliament appoint a parliamentary committee, effectively, to take over the management of the convention and the appointment of all the delegates. We think that is quite an impracticable and, frankly, unreasonable proposition. We went to the last election with a clear policy&mdash;that half of the delegates would be elected by the government. That was made clear in John Howard's statement as opposition leader on 8 June 1995 in response to the then Prime Minister's speech on this matter where the policy was laid down. That stated quite clearly that the government would appoint half the delegates.  We repeated that policy through to the election, and we were elected on that basis. We intend acting on the basis of the policy on which we were elected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4709">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe it is a legitimate prerogative of the government, as the elected government of Australia, to make these sorts of decisions&mdash;to set up a convention and to appoint half the delegates. As it turns out, 116 of the 152 delegates will be representatives of the people&mdash;40 will be parliamentarians elected by the people, 76 will be community delegates elected by the people, giving 116 of 152, or about two-thirds, who will be direct representatives of the people and leaving only 36 who will be non-parliamentary appointed delegates. So that is the implementation of the policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a bit rich and a bit unreasonable for the parliament to be subverting in this way what we regard as the proper role of the government&mdash;particularly, may I say, with due respect, coming from the Labor Party. What is being put before us today is not the way the Labor government operated. In the 13 years of the Hawke-Keating government, there were many examples of conventions, summits, meetings, conferences, whatever, established by the government as a matter of government policy which did not involve any legislation, which did not involve any parliamentary committees and which involved very significant issues and the members, attendees or delegates of which were appointed by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Constitutional Commission, which discussed the constitution, sat from 1985 to 1988. The Labor Party tells us that that was very important. We agree. That was established by the Hawke government and the members of it were appointed by the Hawke government. The economics summit was established in 1983 by the government with no legislation, no parliamentary committees and with government invited members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was the 1985 tax summit, which involved a major look at the tax system, where poor old ex-Prime Minister Keating was rolled&mdash;regrettably. That was also set up by the government with no legislation and no parliamentary committees and all members were invited by the government. Last, but not least, the Republic Advisory Committee was established in 1993 to advise the government on the republic. Legislation? No legislation. Parliamentary committee? No parliamentary
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> committee. Who appointed the members? The government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I therefore think, on the basis of the history of the Hawke-Keating governments, it is a bit rich for those opposite to come in here and so self-righteously claim that we are acting undemocratically in implementing our policy. I remind you that we are dealing with a convention which will have 116 out of 152 representatives elected by the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think, in a practical sense, the proposition before the chair would not in fact work&mdash;to establish a committee, to get it working, to work out who the community delegates will be and put that in place as well as have an election. Presumably you would want to operate on the basis that we have been&mdash;that is, that the appointed delegates be identified before the election. You are putting the election way off into next year before it would be possible to put all this in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in fact the case that the government has commenced the process of inviting delegates to the convention that we wish to hold in December of this year. The 40 parliamentary delegates to be appointed are almost all identified. They are being appointed mostly by bodies other than the federal government&mdash;they are coming from the states, territories, the opposition and other parties. We have, because of the pressure from particularly the republicans but also the monarchists to identify the appointed delegates before the election, had to set in train the process of inviting community delegates. We are waiting for their responses before they are announced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a practical sense, because of the government's responsibility to put into place its policy, we have had to move on some of these things. On the track record of previous governments, we do think it is unreasonable for the parliament to attempt to take over the whole business of running this convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have consulted with other parties on the question of the non-parliamentary appointed delegates. The Prime Minister wrote to the  Democrats and the Labor Party and others seeking their suggestions. They have been given due account in deciding whom we should invite. I think as and when the list of 36 non-parliamentary appointed delegates is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4710"> revealed, it will generally be well received in the community. We have gone to great lengths to ensure that they can not only make a constructive contribution to a discussion of whether or not Australia should become a republic but also take account of the need to ensure that young people, women, Aboriginals and others who would otherwise not be well represented in an election are well represented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also agree with Senator Bolkus that, in the conduct of the convention itself, if the convention is to work effectively there will need to be a good degree of bipartisanship. That was one of the reasons we appointed as Chairman Ian Sinclair and as Deputy Chair Barry Jones, the President of the Labor Party&mdash;to ensure that there is that degree of cooperation. We intend to consult widely with republican organisations, monarchist organisations and the delegates who will be attending as to how the convention should be conducted. But that is, properly, the prerogative of government and not of a parliamentary committee. We are therefore opposed to the opposition amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have commented on the appointment of delegates to the convention before. My view is that, in the absence of a full-scale election of delegates to the convention, the composition needs to be such that there is a quality of representation from the states. That argument has been lost. As I have said before, the majority of, if not all, previous delegations have been comprised on the basis of equality of representation from the states. I do not want to recanvass that particular issue; I just mention it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation now where that is not going to be the case and there will be a predominance of delegates presumably from New South Wales and Victoria. Now the government has indicated their proposition in this legislation that there should be 38 appointed delegates. I can understand the point of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Senator Minchin) when he says that within the appointment of the 38 there should be an opportunity to ensure that there is proper representation at the convention by
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> persons such as, as he mentioned, Aboriginals and women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand that point of view, but the government does not have a propriety right over the type of selection. The government supports this proposition before us, but there would be others who might make suggestions to the government which the government might find useful. My view has been that, in so far as it is possible, delegates to this convention should be selected by the people&mdash;by the electorate, by the voters. If that is not possible, then they ought to be selected and appointed by persons directly elected by the general electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin quite clearly could say, `That's what we're doing; we, as a government, have been elected directly by the people.' But the government, as a government, has not been elected directly by the people. The government is appointed by the Governor-General. The government holds its position as government only whilst it retains the confidence of the House of Representatives. It has nothing to do with the Senate, unless the government chooses to go along the double dissolution track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are now considering this particular proposition that is before us. At least the proposition that is before us enables a number of persons&mdash;that is, from both the House of Representatives and the Senate&mdash;to be represented on the committee that is to appoint the delegation. I think that is a reasonable approach because ultimately it is going to come back to this parliament to determine what is going to be put to the people by way of a constitutional referendum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the question going to be? That depends upon what legislation is adopted by this parliament&mdash;the whole of the parliament, including the House of Representatives and the Senate. As you know, constitutional referenda are about questions that are contained in a bill which is adopted by both houses of the parliament. I would think that,  under those circumstances, it is quite reasonable for both houses of parliament to be involved in the appointment of the 36 face&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In good faith the government has gone ahead and sought the views of persons that it has considered to be appropriate delegates to the convention. That is fair enough.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask Senator Bolkus, as I cannot find it in any of his proposed amendments, what the constitution of that particular committee will be. All the amendment says is that there shall be a committee of 12 members of parliament, to be known as the joint committee on the Constitutional Convention. It does not say how many to come from the House of Representatives, how many to come from the Senate, how many to be nominated by the government and how many to be nominated by the opposition, minor parties or Independents.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe I can answer the last part of Senator Harradine's question first and, in doing so, maybe give us some time to further crystallise it if we need to. Proposed section 169A(5) is the section that goes to the appointment. We have deliberately allowed flexibility for the parliament to determine the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> two issues that Senator Harradine refers to&mdash;that is, the proportion of House of Representatives as opposed to Senate and also the proportion of government as opposed to other parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, we say it could be left up to a resolution of both houses of parliament to determine, obviously through negotiation. But we are envisaging here the normal model for joint parliamentary committees whereby, if one was to put it in this particular clause&mdash;and we can embark upon drafting it if the Senate is so inclined&mdash;we would be looking at, for instance, eight from the House of Representatives and four from the Senate as a starting point for discussion and, of the 12 members, six to be government, four to be opposition, one Democrat and, say, one from other parties or individuals who hold seats in parliament. That is a formula that has been used for the normal joint parliamentary committee. As I said at the outset, we have allowed for a certain degree of flexibility, to be determined between the parties and the individuals represented in the parliament, to get the balance right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine, if you have any views as to whether we should define it now, crystallise it now, or whether it can be left there for negotiation or whether it can be left there until this matter comes back&mdash;as we are told it will come back to this place&mdash;we have some time to do that. But the deliberate intention of the opposition was at this particular stage to allow for some flexibility but to follow the model that is often followed for joint committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to your other point about good faith, can I say at this stage that we do not know the names of most of those people who have been approached by government. To that extent, they are protected. I do say, though, that the government was sent copies of our proposed amendments quite some time ago, before this week, before last week. They were on notice that there would be a consideration  in the Senate of whether those elected by the people should have a say in selecting those appointed to this convention.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite that, we need to be concerned about people's sensitivities and privacy.

We had to act if we are to put in place a convention in December and an election process leading up to it with the names of the appointed delegates identified as far beforehand as possible so that people have a reasonable chance to decide whether to nominate for election or not. So, despite your notification of the amendment, we had to proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With reference to the previous government, which did not have this view&mdash;and I also want to refer to the complaints that were made just a short time ago about the time taken to proceed with this&mdash;I actually do feel that this is a matter of some import from my perspective, I have to say. We are actually talking about a convention, and Senator Margetts probably made the point a little earlier too. This is not simply a convention to determine whether an Australian should be head of state or not, and over the 10 days I am absolutely confident that, no matter who goes to the convention, the discussion is going to be far broader than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will be a convention that will actually determine the constitutional basis for what Australia is going to be for the next 100 years, hopefully. If, indeed, the convention determines, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) clearly already has, that the status quo that we enjoy now is going to be the basis for the next 100 years, in my opinion it will be a failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, I could not think of a more appropriate institution to have some input into this than the parliament. This is an eminently reasonable and sensible proposal. I strongly endorse this amendment. I am not ascribing any ill&hyphen;will towards the government, either. I do not think that the government set out to  monopolise the choice. My own knowledge of a number of people who have been proposed, for example from the Northern Territory, indicates that there is no bad faith in this. But

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator MINCHIN</EMPHASIS> (South Australia&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (South Australia&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (9.25 p.m.)&mdash;The government has appointed the delegates according to the criteria it laid down in announcing its policy. Primarily, the 36 appointed delegates will be people who can make a constructive contribution to the debate on the question of whether or not Australia should become a republic. They have been appointed on that basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We said that 10 per cent of the appointed delegates should be between the ages of 18 and 25. Of the 36 delegates we have invited, eight will be between 18 and 25 years old. We said there would be proper representation of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders and you will find there is. We said there would be a proper balance between men and women and you will find, when they are announced, that there is. Further than that, I cannot really add much to what I have already said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cabinet made the final decision and, on the authority of the cabinet, 36 people have been invited. When we have a full list of 36 people who have accepted the invitation to be at the convention, their names will be announced&mdash;in due course. I do not think I can add any more. I am not sure whether I have missed one of your questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, I have: you asked how many we wrote to and who they were. As I have said before&mdash;and it is on the public record&mdash;some 850 names were put forward, either self&hyphen;nominated or nominated by other groups. The government also had access to a whole range of names of people who were not formally nominated or self&hyphen;nominated, and it gave consideration to those. A very wide range of Australians has been considered for the 36 appointed positions.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you well know, we invited your party and the Democrats to nominate people, and those nominations have been given proper consideration. We also asked every other government in Australia&mdash;all state and territory governments&mdash;to submit names. We asked the Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy and the Australian Republican Movement to nominate people whom they thought we should consider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we think it has been a very open process. We have been receiving names from people since last year. We said&mdash;in the election and during the course of last year&mdash;that it was our intention to have a convention, so people have been writing to us since then, suggesting their names or those of others. The convention was confirmed in March, and we have had a considerable increase in the flow of people who have been putting their names forward since March. In terms of what this is about, the process of choosing 36 non&hyphen;parliamentary appointed delegates has been quite fair, open and reasonable. I was pleased to hear Senator Bob Collins&mdash;obviously judging from information he has received in relation to some of those who have been invited&mdash;say that it was a very fair, proper, reasonable and representative group of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator BOLKUS</EMPHASIS> (South Australia) (South Australia) (9.28 p.m.)&mdash;I did ask you who made the appointment, but the intent of that question was to find out what process was established to put names to cabinet.

I did not quite get your answer in terms of which organisations were approached.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it is to be successful, it is vital that the Constitutional Convention reflects the diverse experiences, backgrounds, views, beliefs and aspirations of the Australian people. To that end, the appointment of non&hyphen;parliamentary delegates to the Convention should reflect the diversity of our nation. Furthermore, it is to be hoped that all groups standing for election to the Convention will draw upon our diversity when nominating candidates. In particular, and in light of the fact that the Constitutional Conventions of the 1890s which led to Federation were composed entirely of male delegates, it is to be hoped that all groupings will provide for the fair and equal representation of women.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Amendment 82 is the amendment that imports into the bill a preamble. We think a preamble is important as a reflection of the importance
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4716"> of this process we are involved in. We are in the process of working towards Australia becoming a republic, and we think this convention has a particular responsibility to help build towards that road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said the day before yesterday, we think the objects clause that the government had in the legislation&mdash;the purpose of the act&mdash;is pretty barren and sterile and does not reflect the sorts of considerations that need to be reflected in the early part of a bill such as this. What we are suggesting is that a preamble should appear on page 1 after line 11 and the preamble should detail:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Act provides the necessary framework for the election and appointment of delegates . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We should also set out what we think the convention should do, such as:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> whether the present Constitution should be changed so that Australia might become a republic with its own Head of State . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Other considerations relating to Australia becoming a republic should also be included.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important aspect of the preamble, and one that does pick up some of the debate we had earlier today, is that we think it should be reflected in the legislation that, for the convention to be as successful as possible, it needs to reflect the composition of the Australian society. The government have said to a certain extent that they have tried to do that with their appointments. Obviously, the constituent groups and individuals which will be running will try to reflect the diversity of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think it is important that the preamble of the legislation reflect that we have come a long way since the 1890s&mdash;the time when the federation convention was entirely made up of male delegates, as Senator Bob Collins mentioned earlier. We should now reflect the fact that we are a diverse society with different backgrounds, views and aspirations. That diversity should be reflected in this particular convention to maximise the chances of its success and relevance to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, we want to embody in our preamble the aspiration that groupings will provide fair and equal representation of women in their
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lists to be put up for election. We think this preamble is appropriate and relevant for a process like this. As we said earlier when we amended out clause 6&mdash;the purpose of the act&mdash;we thought a preamble such as this was much more appropriate than that sterile purpose put up by the government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I cannot resist the temptation, having heard the last statement of Senator Minchin, in respect of the previous matter, of how appalling a proposition it was that the parliament would usurp the power of the executive. I clearly recall&mdash;and I think it is fair to give Senator Minchin the credit for this&mdash;that Senator Minchin was the most trenchant public critic of the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, in respect of his constant assertions that he was `hijacking this particular debate'. Those comments were made by Senator Minchin. I have to say that I do not know anyone, including Paul Keating, who could have asserted the rights of the executive over this parliament more aggressively than Senator Minchin just did. I just point that out in passing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I strongly support Senator Bolkus's amendment and preamble. Preambles do, where appropriate, play an important role. Nothing could be more appropriate than this preamble, in terms of this particular piece of legislation. This preamble will indicate clearly, if it is carried and supported subsequently in the House of Representatives, the will of this parliament as to the balance of this convention and, in a real sense, to the outcome of it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4717">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister, of course, is a powerful person in these debates. It is a matter of great regret to me that the current Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Howard), although he is absolutely entitled to his view, is so wedded to the past rather than to the future and has so clearly laid down his position on this matter. As I just said, if this convention determines&mdash;and I do not think it will&mdash;that the status quo and the constitution that has served us well for the last 100 years is in fact the appropriate basis for the next 100 years, it will have been a failure, and a profound failure. But the Prime Minister is certainly of that view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, I do not think anyone could have summed it up better than how Laurie Oakes did in the opening paragraph of his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> article on the Prime Minister's current visit to Great Britain when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One federal Liberal MP reckons this is the trip of John Howard's boyhood dreams. `Pussy cat, pussy cat, where have you been? I've been to London to visit the Queen, and to watch the cricket at Lord's.' Howard whipped through a visit to China in four days, working the whole time, refusing even to go to the Great Wall because it might look indulgent. But he does not mind a bit of indulgence on his first trip to the old country as Prime Minister. The pace is leisurely and the symbolism is wrong.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the reason I have quoted it. This is symbolic. This preamble is symbolism, and symbolism is important in public life. This convention is, as other senators have made the point this evening, a Constitutional Convention. It is not simply, as some people see it, a convention to determine whether we remain as a constitutional monarchy or we have an Australian as our own head of state and become a minimalist or a maximalist republic. It is going to go far more widely than that, as I am sure Senator Minchin hopes. It is going to talk about the constitutional basis for the kind of Australia that we will have over the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very timely indeed that it is happening. The make&hyphen;up of this Constitutional Convention, however selected, will be dramatically different from the one that was constituted at the turn of the century. I point out, as Senator Harradine knows full well in terms of his concerns a little earlier, that it is a cold, hard
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fact&mdash;having read widely of those constitutional conventions, particularly the earlier ones that failed&mdash;that, if it had been proposed and insisted upon that there be not the same level of representation from each state, no matter how different the populations were, there certainly would have been no Federation, not in 1901 at least, because there would have been no agreement on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we do live in a different Australia today, and that is what concerns me about the make&hyphen;up of this convention. It is why I think this preamble is so important in at least giving some leadership at the federal parliamentary level to what kind of convention this should be. The reason I say that&mdash;Senator Margetts commented on this earlier this evening&mdash;is that there will be a lot of people at this convention with different views and different agendas for this country of ours. That is precisely what this convention is there to sort out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts agreed that it could well be the first run around the paddock for the Pauline Hanson One Nation party. I will be amazed if that party, which are busily formally recruiting members right across Australia at the moment, do not use this election for this convention to try to get their candidates, as they are entitled to do, to put their view of what kind of Australia we should have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my great dismay, I saw for the first time today the material that is being circulated in my home city of Darwin, where I have lived for 30 years. I am dismayed at the prospect of anyone from that party turning up at that convention and having any influence over it. The view that they would have&mdash;totally contrary to the terms of this amendment&mdash;would be that you cannot be an Australian unless you are white, you certainly cannot be an Australian if you are black and you certainly cannot be an Australian if you are Asian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an extremist view. It is a view of bigots. It is a view of extremists. It is the view of peddlers of hate and division in this country. It is the view of a number of very dangerous people, as Senator Boswell very correctly pointed out yesterday, that are deter mined to destroy utterly the inclusive and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4718"> tolerant society that Australia generally is today. It is dangerous, but it is happening right now as we are debating this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a recruitment drive going on in the city of Darwin at the moment for members for Pauline Hanson's One Nation party. This emerged for the first time, I think, yesterday in Darwin. Advertisements are being placed and people are being direct mailed. I just want to advise the Senate of the letter that has been sent out which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thanks very much for your letter. Please find enclosed enough membership forms&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">these are membership forms for the Pauline Hanson One Nation party&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">What follows are all the contact telephone numbers and fax numbers for the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and her party headquarters. The final paragraph says:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely.</PARA>

But what then is enclosed is this appalling document, a magazine printed every fortnight, which is called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An eye for an eye</EMPHASIS> . It is a fortnightly news bulletin described by the editor himself as, `This is your official bulletin of revenge!'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What then follows is the usual garbage, but it is dangerous garbage. What then follows is a reference in the golfing section to Tiger Woods, that outstanding athlete from the United States, describing him as `that black Asian&hyphen;American half breed Tiger Woods', et cetera. Included in this newspaper is an endorsement of our own Chief Minister's comments just recently in respect of Aboriginal itinerants, the drunken ones, needing to be `monstered and stomped on by the community'. He gets a pat on the back. There is the usual diatribe claiming the Holocaust never happened. There is an extraordinary attack on the front page, and I will quote it:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">What follows is a draft letter to be sent to politicians, saying that Nicky Buckley should be taken off television because she is pregnant. I understand she had her baby, a son, today. I wish both mother and son very well. This is an appalling document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that I will not go on at any length I will seek leave to table this document. I cleared this earlier with the whip, Senator Heffernan. People can read it for themselves. This material is being circulated along with membership forms for the Pauline Hanson party. The reason I wanted to make this point is I do believe this party will make a serious attempt at getting delegates elected to this convention. Of course they will.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 has been introduced into this parliament as a result of the budget last year when the government descended into a cost cutting frenzy without regard to the effect of that cost cutting. This bill should not be before the parliament tonight. It is a bill that has been substantially gutted by the government, and the amendments that the government has foreshadowed to its own legislation are huge. The government proposes to remove those sections of this bill which relate to ship construction. The government proposes to oppose its own amendments in this bill which relate to machine tools and robotics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government has not explained is why it does not take the same attitude to the bounties that apply to the computer industry in Australia or why it does not take the same view that applies to the book publishing industry in Australia. The fact that the government is selective leaves the government open to the allegation, which in this case is profoundly true, that the government reacts to political pressure and does not act within a logical policy structure on industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence, I propose to move at the conclusion of my remarks an amendment to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the second reading which I understand is being circulated in the chamber. That amendment will draw attention to the government's approach here and to the government's explicit duplicity when, in the 1996 election, it promised faithfully to the computer industry of Australia that the Labor government's extension of the computer bounty to the year 2000 would be honoured by the coalition. This legislation explicitly breaks that promise and it does so blatantly and without any justifiable explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has plunged Australian industry into confusion and despair as to what its policy really is. This bill, in its original form, cut out bounty assistance to ships, to books, to machine tools and robotics and to computer manufacturing. It did so in a manner ahead of the time of the normal termination of these bounties as set down in statutes. Thus, it reduced the competitiveness of Australian industry by weakening the industry's confidence in the future. It reduced the competitiveness of Australian industry by disrupting industry's forward planning. It reduced the competitiveness of Australian industry by, in several cases, explicitly causing Australian companies to lose contracts. That is a documented fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the shipbuilding industry, contracts have been lost to overseas bidders because of the government's inability to act quickly to deal with the problems of that sector. The same is true in the machine tools area, the books area and, doubtless would be true, if one investigated it completely, in the computer area. Because the government has caused private sector companies to lose contracts, disrupted their forward planning and disrupted their structural plans, they have also put a brake on employment growth and on the optimum outcome for these industry sectors for Australia. That goes against the needs of a national economy and is a sad indictment of the government's attitude in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation went ahead without consultation with industry. There was no time to give notice to industry to adjust to the needs  of the future, because this was imposed on them, out of the blue, on budget night without
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4722"> warning. Minister Moore remained imperious and aloof to industry entreaties upon the announcement after the budget. His door was closed and only prised open with selective pressure from various industry groups. Not all got in to see him and, when some of them did, they got a very cold reception indeed. Initially, that meant that the future for those industry sectors was cast into considerable doubt. Only after considerable pressure did some of those sectors gain some of the rights that they were obviously entitled to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation was justified on the grounds of fiscal consolidation. But it was done so without any consideration or analysis, any investigation or inquiry as to what the effects of these cuts would be on industry, what the effects of these cuts would therefore be in terms of the wider economy and, ultimately, whether the cause of fiscal consolidation would be achieved or not. By cutting the outlays on bounties, the government did not consider the brake it would put on growth in these sectors and, therefore, the contribution these industries could make to the income side of the budget by higher employment, by less reliance on unemployment and by a range of other profit taxes that these companies would pay.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It only cut out negatively, and in a way which goes against the budget bottom line, these bounties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the grounds of fiscal consolidation, it cut out these bounties in the face explicitly of a report of the now Productivity Commission, which argued, in the case of the computer bounty, that that bounty should be continued. The Productivity Commission is notorious as the ultra dry economic advice agency of the government. After an extended review of 2&half; years, that agency said that this bounty should continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government cut this bounty out in the face of that advice and did not consider the ongoing inquiry that the Productivity Commission had into the book bounty at the time either. It did not wait for the inquiry to report; it cut out the bounty. It did so as well on the grounds of fiscal consolidation without any thought or recognition of the un&hyphen;level international playing field in the international marketplace that these industry sectors have
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to compete in. It just did it without thought, without consideration, without analysis and without concern for the impact on growth, companies, their profitability, the workers they employ and the prospects for employment in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government proposes, as I have said, to substantially amend this bill. It does so selectively, and the selection choice seems to be based on how effective the lobby was rather than on a framework of policy for industry. What is clear is that this government has a piecemeal approach to industry policy. It has not thought out framework structure for industry policy. In fact, it admits that itself. It is conducting the Mortimer review into industry policy in Australia to see what its industry policy should be. That review has not yet reported. That review will not be able to be encapsulated in the last budget. We will have to wait at least another year before the outcome of that review is implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the meanwhile, Australian industry wallows around not knowing the signal this government is emitting to them. It knows what it emits to some sections of industry that can bring pressure to bear. It does not know what the objective reality is for all industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I, of course, applaud the decision in the case of the ships industry. I make no apology in this parliament that I align myself to the cause of this industry sector and that I campaigned in order that its bounty be restored, as I did with the other three sectors under this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the ships sector was successful says a lot about the campaigning ability of industry leaders in that sector, about the spectacular growth that that particular industry had achieved, coming from nothing in eight years to currently earning half a billion in exports, and leading the world in the only area of complex sophisticated technology where Australia can say it is the world leader. Those facts put together create a stunning story of growth and achievement, which even this government had to recognise and finally concede. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4723">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But having said that, the other industry sectors in their own way can produce equally compelling evidence as well. I will come to those in a moment. The machine tools and robotics industry is a key industry that supports the rest of Australian industry achievement in complex manufactures because it is at the cutting edge of modern day technology and equipment for manufacture. In the case of that industry, the fact that this bill has been delayed for so long meant that the individual firms concerned were able to still legally access the bounty. Now the government's change is to allow that to occur, it has been defeated on the ground by those companies, given the delay this legislation has had in coming to the chamber. The government rightly and sensibly recognises that it cannot claim the bounty back off those companies to the time it originally intended to prematurely remove this bounty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The areas in which this government has decided to continue with its cuts to the bounty refer to the computer bounty industry sector and the books bounty industry sector. The government will chop their bounties and all of those things that I said earlier about lack of consideration, lack of analysis and the fiscal imperative that I cited earlier apply equally to these industries&mdash;and, in fact, more so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the computer industry, following a Productivity Commission inquiry, the Labor government, at a time in which I had the privilege of being industry minister, put through a bill in this parliament to extend the computer bounty to the year 2000. I vividly recall the debate in this chamber on the night that legislation went through. I see, much to his personal discomfort, I am sure, that the minister carrying this legislation tonight on behalf of the government, is Senator Warwick Parer. Senator Parer at that time spoke in that debate on the computer bounty and said&mdash;and it is in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, if anyone wishes to check it&mdash;that the coalition would support the government in extending the computer bounty to the year 2000. He went on to say&mdash;as his party did and as his Prime Minister and industry minister did in the election campaign&mdash;that they supported
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the computer industry by that solid, solemn promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the election, we have learnt of the reinterpretation of election promises by this government. It appears now that that solemn, sober promise made by Senator Warwick Parer is to be repudiated&mdash;and tonight, no doubt, or tomorrow, he will explain why it is that the government proposes to break it and why his personal speech in the chamber that night is to be repudiated. He will explain that that was not a core promise. It was just another promise that was disposable and it is in the trash can now, irrespective of the particular needs of this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say these things about the computer industry. The computer industry and the telecommunications industry together form the fastest growing industry sector in the world. In fact, together, they are the biggest industry sector in the world. Australia is a voracious consumer of computer equipment. Our level of technology literacy in the area of IT&amp;T leads the world or is at the leading edge among the leading countries of the world. We have a trade deficit in computer and computer technology of $6 billion a year as we stand here now, and under the forecast growth of demand in the Australian domestic economy for computer and telecommunications equipment, by the year 2000, even with the bounty, we will have a deficit in trade of $20 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A government that is concerned about the blowing out of its trade deficit would not do this, and tonight it should confess that it will not do this. If it is concerned about the blowing out of its current account deficit, it will ensure&mdash;by prematurely cutting a bounty that this industry had as a bipartisan political decision in 1995 and on which the industry planned its future development to the year 2000&mdash;that it stunts the growth of this industry, opens the door to imports, loses jobs from Australia, and pushes Australian companies overseas. It will mean that our economy is destabilised by the running up of an even higher current account trade deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact and the damage to the economy will be huge. The impact on regional Australia will also be felt widely, because this industry is not just located in the major  capitals of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4724"> Sydney and Melbourne. It is located in country Victoria, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Tasmania and all around Australia. The damage to the regional economy in the sunrise industry of the 21st century will be huge, and this government has a lot to answer for for prematurely moving to strip down the Australian competitive ability in this industry sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the books industry, this is one of those industries that is a story of achievement by Australians. What is not commonly known is that Australian book publishers supply a lot of the curriculum in the United States school system for education purposes. Australian book publishers supply a lot of the basic texts for the Californian and Florida education system. They provide a lot of the current texts in terms of the writing and editing and the designing and presentation of those books for the Malayasian, Indian and Chinese education systems as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have here an industry that has grown out of the intellectual capacity of our country and the multicultural nature of Australia. It is able to write high quality publications that succeed in the first markets of the world in the United States, and translate, adapt and sell them to the emerging economies of our region as well. It is a commitment that ought to achieve recognition by the government as the sort of thing that we expect Australian entrepreneurs to do. Instead, the bounty for this industry is to be cut out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the industry's own calculations, they have produced an illustration of how wrong&hyphen;headed and how bad the effect of that will be on their industry. By the industry's own calculations, it is an industry worth, at current dollar values, $450 million a year. The book bounty that will be saved by the abolition in this bill will be $5 million a year, but the negative impact caused by the abolition of the book bounty will create a deficit&mdash;and a deficit by a decline in PAYE taxpaying because of loss of employment in this industry sector&mdash;of $9.6 million by a loss of payroll tax of $2.7 million and by the payment of unemployment benefits to displaced Australians of $21 million: a total of $33.3 million. The net negative impact of the cut of a $5 million bounty in this industry sector to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the national economy is $28.3 million. And that is not all of it either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a $120 million adverse effect on the balance of payments. In terms of employment, there is an expected loss of 1,500 jobs, mainly in Maryborough in Victoria and in Queensland. That is not the end of it either. Because of the arrangements that apply to tariff levels for imported paper&mdash;70 per cent of this industry's publications are printed on Australian paper; 30 per cent is imported&mdash;and the special quality papers needed, a tariff of five per cent is applied. So already, for this industry to be internationally competitive, it has to jump a five per cent cost hurdle to import its paper needs, to print its product in Australia and to distribute it to the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate Economics Committee inquiry into this legislation was unanimous in saying that that is an anomalous position and it is a negative assistance to the industry of in excess of five per cent and that the government should remove that tariff in so far as the needs of this industry are concerned. We have seen a unanimous, bipartisan recommendation from this Senate's Economics Committee and a recommendation not responded to in any positive way from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons and for the reasons that I have cited in the case of the computer industry and the book industry, I will be moving an amendment to the second reading which will call upon the government to consult with these industry sectors to develop industry sector plans so that all of the impacts in costs on these industry sectors can be considered and a plan for their growth and development with that industry sector can be developed to put these industries back on the line of further growth. The impact in the case of the book industry will not be felt only in industry; it will be felt in the cultural standards of Australia&mdash;in the education system of Australia&mdash;as well as in exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at a model for the book industry and the type of psychology behind the cuts to the bounty that have been introduced here, the model would be New Zealand. What happened in the case of New Zealand? With the  removal of assistance, there is now no book
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4725"> manufacturing industry whatsoever in the two islands of New Zealand. The industry has gone into decline and vanished. The same fate awaits it here with the removal of this bounty and with the failure of the government to do anything at all about developing a plan for this industry sector so that it can grow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue here is that the government should withdraw this legislation, rethink its direction and then come forward after proper consultations with industry, after proper analysis of the industry impacts of this legislation and after knowing what will occur rather than hoping and guessing and leaping in the dark, with plans and legislation to support industry development in Australia. If this government fails to do so, all of its words about support for industry and support for small business are empty rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the government refuses to develop a framework for industry development in this country, it undermines the ability of Australian industry to have confidence in government direction and planning and to know the platform upon which they have to develop their own industry sector in order to grow. The government needs to emit a long, strong, clear signal of support for industry and the direction that it wants it to develop. We did that in government. This government abolished it in the budget before last. It is not too late, despite the loss of production, jobs and growth that has occurred in the intervening period, to come back to the aid of Australian industry. This government should do so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 covers the elimination of the ships bounty, the book bounty, the computer bounty and the machine tools and robots bounty. Basically, it is an attack on industry policy. The bounties were all set to terminate anyway. The government was just hastening it. Unfortunately for the government, I guess, it did not expedite the bill. The result ends up being a stupidity where, with a measure originally set to terminate in a month, the government will now try to backdate termination to 1996. It is therefore basically retroactive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the ships bounty, the government was lobbied heavily and seemed to accept that it should leave this alone. The current termination date is 30 June 1997. With this change, they must have been under construction or contract by 20 August 1996 to qualify. If under contract, they must have been contracted for completion by 30 June this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a heavy subsidy of overseas industries. The United States refused to join an anti&hyphen;subsidy agreement. Therefore, there is none. Builders argued for a pro rata bounty for ships that were partly completed on termination. This will result in a slow escalation in price rather than a steep increase in price. This is, of course, yet another blow to shipbuilding and perhaps ships of a good standard in  Australia, along with the elimination of tariff concessions, ship grants and accelerated depreciation. They are all going at the same time. The ships bounty has been valuable, particularly for the Tasmanian catamarans and for Perth industry. There are other examples that I am sure senators have been informed about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also relates to the books bounty. The current termination date is 31 December 1997; this legislation will mean that it terminated on 20 August last year. The transitional arrangements now are if production started or
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4726"> a contract existed. If they specify the title of the book by the termination date, they can still get the bounty up until 20 February this year. Industry had already planned for a wind&hyphen;down. Financing for the industry reflected that. Early termination threatens this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The long-term contracts for paper and so on were taken based on expectations of the bounty. The book industry in Australia works on small margins. It is highly competitive in relation to costs of offshore printing. The loss of the tax revenue and higher unemployment in some areas will be a consequence of the decision. As was mentioned by Senator Cook, paper is taxed at five per cent and books are imported tax free, so it is obviously going to be cheaper to import with this change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission's comments appear to be based on fantasy. They said that there was a growing book industry when in fact it was stagnant. There also seems to be an inflated reporting of customs administration costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to computers, the current termination date is 31 December 2000; and the proposed termination is 30 June this year. Information technology is a critical industry. The bounty tended to be a compensation for the small local market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tariff concession changes, outsourcing and research and development concession all impact negatively on the computer industry. In 1996, parliament decided to extend the scheme to 2000. There was, as you can imagine, some expectation that this would be honoured and investments were made and loans were taken on that premise. Computers are imported duty free; components are dutiable. Once again, we are favouring imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to machine tools and robots, the current termination date is 30 June 1997; the proposed termination was last year, 20 August 1996. Under the transition arrangements, if production started or if a contract existed specifying the title of the book by the termination date, the bounty could be available until 20 February 1997. The use of a bounty rather than a tariff allows the import of tax-free machines and keeps prices down. Costs
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of production are high in Australia and there is a small market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about critical production tools. If we give an incentive to make the means of production here, we will move into much higher value added products and that will lead to export and import replacement. Often, very high skills are needed to make machine tools. Those involved in this process may move laterally to other industries, taking their skills with them. The research and development is of high intensity and it is a significant industry for other manufacturing industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think, in these various areas, we are being particularly clever in the actions we have taken. I think what we are eventually going to have to do, some time in the not too distant future, is look at all the actions we are taking. We are going to have to look at whether we want to develop a high-tech industry, what we are doing in terms of value adding to industry and whether we want to forget our market altogether and import everything. In the end, something has to crack. We cannot continue to try to find primary goods&mdash;low price, high volume primary goods&mdash;to export in volume.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end something has to crack, and that something is employment. We know that that is what is happening. It is not about whether or not kids can be forced into schools when they feel they no longer want to go. It is about the fact that we have structured our industry. With this new love affair with internationalisation, it is inevitable that the kinds of industries we are getting are often capital intensive&mdash;they shed labour. The new ideology for the service industry is: fewer people, more machines, more computers, more centralisation. The reality is that this is the direction we are heading in. We are forgetting about our local market altogether. We are not necessarily meeting our local market needs. I think the consumer loses as well. That is a pity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think Australia should be going too far down this one-way path without ever sitting back and assessing where we are going, how we are going and why. In the not too distant future I will be coming up with
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4727"> some proposals for us to look in detail at trade policy and the impact it is having on employment, the environment, our social system, our regions, and so on. I think it is far overdue that we look at that. The WA Greens will not be supporting the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short time before the adjournment starts, I rise to support my colleague Senator Cook. I believe there is real concern in the area of computers. The government was prepared to reverse its decision in respect of ships purely and simply based on the fact that there was commercial pressure applied to it. But, as Senator Cook clearly outlined, in the area of computers we have nothing more than a broken promise from this government once again. This, of course, is of grave concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Due to the late hour and the fact that this matter has been on the boil for a substantial period and the government has been toing&hyphen;and&hyphen;froing on this issue, I am not going to focus on anything else other than the computer situation as it affects my state of Queensland. What the government has effectively done by removing the computer bounty well ahead of time is cause undoubted uncertainty for many small businesses&mdash;and they are small businesses&mdash;in the state of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not talking about major corporations that are in receipt of the bounty, we are talking about small businesses&mdash;businesses that are at the leading edge out there in the business community. Technology is important to us in the future. The bounty has been, in some measure, small business's way of competing on a competitive playing field with their opponents from overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Businesses that should be getting encouragement from the government have been clearly abandoned on this occasion. In Queensland, the bounty paid to firms for the year to 30 June 1996 totalled nearly $3 million&mdash;$2.925 million. That is not an overly large amount to business, but it is a significant amount which assists them to find their way through difficult times and in a very competitive market. If one looks at the list, one will get an indication of how relatively
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> small the figures are but, nonetheless, how important they are to those particular firms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just read a sample from this list. Undoubtedly, the minister should take the time to go through and see how Queensland firms are being affected by this premature decision of the government. Associated Systems Consultants got $1,242; Cost Plus Computers got $8,065; Digilin Pty Ltd got $7,390; Divteed got $11,399; and Future Computers got $632. In some cases, they did not receive substantial amounts but, nonetheless, these amounts are important to these firms and their ability to compete out there in the marketplace.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight on the adjournment I wish to speak briefly about Marian Eldridge. Marian died in February of this year. She was a Canberran of note who should be remembered. She was born and educated in Victoria. She was a teacher of English and history. She had travelled widely in Australia and overseas. She had wide experience as a writer from the time she wrote first at university, although I think she had written much before that time as well. She was a woman of fine reputation. She was a reviewer of books of great standing and was a teacher and editor. She had worked on radio and had been involved in word festivals and many other things. She was a woman who was always thoughtful and always caring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, she was a member of a group of Canberra writers known as the Canberra Seven Writers discussion group. In 1988 they published a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Tales</EMPHASIS>, in which Marian's contribution was called `Capital Gains', a story set around Old Parliament House. I am sure many of you, especially those who worked in that building, would enjoy reading it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4728">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other writers in that group were Margaret Barbalet, Sara Dowse, Suzanne Edgar, Marion Halligan, Dorothy Horsfield and Dorothy Johnston. When I say `the others were', it will not be the same without Marian Eldridge, although the remaining six no doubt will still meet and discuss as they have in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Marian was the ACT Arts Council literature coordinator and a writer&hyphen;in&hyphen;residence in the Northern Territory. She has won many awards and has been a member of many learned literary societies. She was friend to many, certainly to her husband, Ken; her daughters, Elizabeth and Catherine; her sons, David and James; their partners and her grandchildren.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Marian wrote many short stories, and they are all worth reading. Her books which have been published have been donated by her husband, Ken, and placed in the Parliamentary Library. So they are available for you to read. One might ask, `Why did she die so young; why so far ahead of the three score years and 10 that one expects?' In fact, these days a woman can expect to live to 80 or beyond. But Marian contracted cancer and died at the age of 61.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During her last days, her last months, while she was suffering from cancer and reflecting, and her family were reflecting with her on why it should be happening, she wrote 12 poems. Several of them have been published, and one was read at the opening of the Word Festival, held in Canberra earlier this year. The 12 poems are worth reading and are worth publishing. Tonight I seek the leave of the Senate to incorporate them in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> so they are available for people to read.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Run to catch up! Run, catch her sharp, polished shoes!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"This would suit," she says, "I can just see . . . " and I feel a tapestry needle of envy, because I want the lovely waistcoat for myself</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I don't know where to begin," I tell her.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ann Holt smiles. "What did you have in mind?" she asks, picking up a burnt orange jumper and holding it across her miniature bosom in front of a mirror. I tell her she looks a million dollars, and she tosses the jumper at me.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It's you," Ann Holt assures me. "Now what about this blazer for real elegance?"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I have a black wool blazer," I protest, all at once terrified of elegant persuasion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"But not with velvet revers," says Elizabeth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Frowning like a greedy child, I try the blazer on. There's something funny about the cut.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Too fat," I sigh, secretly relieved</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Nonsense," says Ann Holt. She hurries me to the counter. "This jacket is badly tailored," she tells the assistant.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ann Holt grows taller by the moment. "Excuse me," she says quietly, "This has nothing to do with Modom's hip. My mother, who was employed as a tailor in this store, would never allow a miscut garment on to the showroom. Please show us another blazer immediately." But there is no other blazer. Ann Holt stares at the ceiling. Then something funny happens. Here over the manager's arm is the very blazer, which someone is supposed to pay for in the next half hour, by closing time.</PARA>

During that speech, I made some comments about the fact that some people in Australia, in the constitutional monarchy camp, claim that the Governor-General is our head of state. I pointed out that that was an absurdity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During that debate, I also made reference to the fact that the Clerk of the Senate, Mr Evans, has written many articles. In fact, I have gone back to my file and got them all out to refresh myself. He has been a prolific writer&mdash;I say that not in a pejorative sense&mdash;on the issue of the constitution, the republic and the powers of the Senate, et  cetera. That has been part of the public debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is true to say, after having read through most of this material that I have refreshed my memory on, that the clerk, Mr Evans, has taken an unusual position on some aspects of the republic debate. Again, I do not say that in a pejorative sense. But when you look at some of the views he has raised, they are quite legitimate and are part of the public debate. At one stage in the debate I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have even seen articles written by our eminent Clerk of the Senate saying that we do not need to change because in fact we are a de facto republic in every sense other than whom our head of state is.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are my words; they are not a direct quote from the Clerk of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of those remarks, I received a note from Mr Evans yesterday saying that my description cannot be attributed directly to him. I want to take this opportunity to put the record straight. Again, having gone back through all the material, I think the theme of what he has written can be interpreted as saying that he has a different view from us normal republicans. I do accept, from all the material that I had available, that he has not explicitly said, unlike others, that the Governor&hyphen;General is effectively our head of state.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to an article Mr Evans wrote on 17 May in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. It contains an interesting variation on the argument about the republic and about constitutional structure. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">One could say that the Constitution&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is, the present constitution&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is 70 per cent republican and 30 per cent monarchical.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have to say that I disagree with that view. The constitution is clearly a constitutional monarchy, and so on. But Mr Evans clearly gives an example of why he believes his view on that matter is correct. I think the theme is there that he has a slightly different view from the one that I have about the structure and the operation of our constitution. I think that is valid, and I am not in any way criticising his right to say that in the broader debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If he believes the words I said in the broader context of the many articles he has written are misleading to his view that he has not actually said outright that in fact the Governor-General is our head of state, I accept that and I put it on the record that he wants that corrected. I certainly accept that. He does point out that he supports strongly that, if there is to be a republic, he wants the President elected by all the people. In several articles he goes through why he thinks that is the best way to go. He talks about a republican culture and various other things. I am not criticising the content of that. I may disagree with it, but he has a right as part of that public debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But he does say in his note to me that, as I had mentioned during my speech, Mr Abbott, a Liberal member in the lower House, has only as early as this week on radio described the Governor-General as our head of state. He wanted to make it quite clear, and I quote from his note to me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also object to being associated with Mr Abbott.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I presume on that particular matter. When I look at the remarks I made&mdash;and one is always pressed for time in these sorts of debates&mdash;I do not think I did infer that Mr Evans and Mr Abbott were in league on this issue. But Mr Evans wants to make it quite clear that he has no association with Mr
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4735"> Abbott on any issue dealing with the republic. I want to accept Mr Evans's view completely and without qualification. That is a correct position of course that he should have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is noted around this place that I have very strong views about the republic and at times I have expressed them strongly. Because the clerk does not have the opportunity to explain his view in this chamber when issues are raised about what he has said, I thought it was only appropriate, that I, at least in my own humble way, try to explain and take the opportunity to put on the record that he had actually written to me disagreeing with my description. I think the only other chance the clerk has to explain himself on the public record is in an estimates committee when the administration of the Senate is before the estimates committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Normally I would not worry about commenting about another senator objecting to something I said, because they can stand up in this place and clear the air themselves. With those few remarks, I am pleased to have had the opportunity to put in context my remarks and certainly make it clear that Mr Evans is not associated with Mr Abbott and that he has made it clear he does not accept the view that the Governor-General is in fact the head of state.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4735"><TITLE>Common Youth Allowance: Youth Unemployment</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to discuss some of the measures that have been proposed this week in relation to young Australians. I was quite distressed this week to see the common youth allowance announced, the specific details of which are yet to be refined and, of course, we are yet to see any legislative format for that scheme. But I think the CYA is yet another example of the scapegoating of young Australians and, specifically, young unemployed Australians today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure comes at the end of a string of measures designed to punish, victimise, even demonise, our young people. The measures introduced that will see 16- and 17-year-olds stripped of unemployment benefits will
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> affect 25,000 young Australians. The means testing arrangements for 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds has the potential to, if not take away benefits completely, at least reduce benefits severely for up to 50,000 young Australians in that age group. I notice that the government is expecting these young people to turn to their families for help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason, I thought it was important to put on record tonight some of the comments in the papers today, the editorials or comments from community and other organisations. Some of these were overlooked in the selective reporting or quoting we had from ministers during question time today. I notice that ACOSS comments that the scheme would hit poor families the hardest. Mr Robert Fitzgerald from ACOSS says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unemployed young people from lower&hyphen;paid and middle&hyphen;income families will lose most.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That concurs with an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  in Melbourne, which states in regard to these changes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And they place great trust in families&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">without trying to ease the pressures that make it increasingly difficult for many families to survive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think the decisions that have been made by this government in the last week totally and fundamentally misread the economic and social reality of family life in the 1990s. There seems to have been no consideration by the government&mdash;it has not taken into account whatsoever&mdash;the struggling and the hardship that families are currently undergoing. Families may have one parent, possibly even two, out of work. The means testing arrangements for this scheme do not take into account that two parents on an income of, say, $20,000 per annum would mean that young people who are unemployed and some students would lose out on their payments as a result of those threshold measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the government claims that these measures have been introduced as an incentive to encourage young people to participate and stay longer in education and training institutions in this country. Why does the government not offer real incentives to young Australians? Why does it insist on introducing
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4736"> disincentives, be they psychological or financial, in the form of fees and charges for education and training? Even at a primary or secondary level, we are seeing increasing charges for incidentals, study and book materials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one disputes that getting young people to stay in education for longer is not necessarily a bad thing, provided those education institutions at all levels are appropriately resourced or compensated. Nobody denies the fundamental link between skilling, training, educating and better work opportunities for the future, especially in such a radically different, radically restructured and constantly changing work force. However, rather than introducing incentives, as I said, this government has introduced disincentives whether they are HECS hikes, up-front and full cost fees, cuts to operating grants, a narrowing of the eligibility criteria or a lowering of the amounts for student financial assistance in the form of Austudy and Abstudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Has the government taken into account the pressures on the school system? The editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new system also has unreal expectations of educational institutions. In Victoria at least, the State Government has wound back financial support for public schools and throughout Australia universities are complaining that the Federal Government is pressing them to increase enrolments while at the same time cutting their funding.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So I do not believe that the additional burden on the school system is going to be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, I acknowledge what both Ministers Vanstone and Newman have said repeatedly in this place and in question time today that 100,000 new traineeship and apprenticeship positions will be created. But let us look at where those positions have come from. Let us look at the TAFE sector which has been cut by at least $72 million. Let us look at the number of training places that have disappeared in the form of labour market programs: at least 120,000 of those will be lost over the next three to four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is particularly ironic when you look at schemes such as LEAP and REAP&mdash;those land care and environmental and regional
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> based labour market programs that did provide young people with some training and some skill development. They would have seen potentially 75,000 places over the next three years. Yet those places have been cut in favour of the so&hyphen;called green corps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the green corps was launched with a bit of a fanfare last week in Sydney, with Mr Abbott doing his job as junior minister in that area. However, only 360 places have been made available under that scheme this year as I understand it in that region. Three thousand young people applied for those places. That contradicts any images perpetuated by this government or the media that young people are not anxious or willing to apply for jobs and that they somehow need to be compelled or required to turn up for employment opportunities. It is not true at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Julian Pocock, the Executive Director of the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition, which is the peak national body representing young Australians in this country, is reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> today as saying the common youth allowance policy is `draconian and a breach of the rights of teenagers to seek work'. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Pocock said 62 percent of young people completed Year 12, but the rest were often in a situation where they had to find work to support themselves or their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He also questioned whether there would be enough training places because 60,000 applicants could not get a place in TAFE colleges last year.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So we see many young Australians not only applying for work opportunities and training opportunities but also for TAFE. Yet 60,000 were denied entry this year alone. I note also that the amount of money originally promised for the green corps scheme was around $68 million, but only $41 million was delivered. Of course, the age range was going to be much larger than what we finally ended up with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not quite understand why the emphasis this week has been on getting more young people to stay at school or on pushing them into education and training without adequate and livable incomes. One of the focuses that seems to have been lost from this debate is the creation of real, sustainable, meaningful
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4737"> long&hyphen;term jobs for young Australians. What do we get instead? I mentioned green corps, but also the work for the dole program&mdash;a debate that we are yet to have in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, the work for the dole scheme is based on the premise that young people need to be compelled to work and that somehow they need to be required to look for jobs, as if this is not happening every day of the week. Young people are engaging in active searching for work. They are filling in jobseeker diaries and they are dealing with the pain and issues of rejection that come with applying for jobs that simply are not there or that many others are applying for as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sad to see some of the myths that have been perpetuated about young people in this place and in the media recently. I notice the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Fischer) was perpetuating some of these myths in the lower house yesterday. Certainly, the idea that young people are choosing to be on unemployment benefits because this provides some sort of enjoyable or interesting lifestyle where they can `swan around'&mdash;and I believe those were the words used by a government member yesterday during the debate&mdash;is sad and quite regressive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this government wanted to fulfil its election promise to give hope to young Australians then what it would give young Australians would be realistic education and training opportunities. It would not put up fees and charges and other barriers to education at whatever level. It would provide young Australians with realistic and adequate levels of income support; that is, livable income or income supplements, not income like Austudy or the common youth allowance which at its maximum rate is no more than 60 per cent of the poverty line, with its average rate around 35 per cent of the poverty line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must remark on a decision made in this place today to cut by at least a third the rent assistance available to students living in shared accommodation. What a mixed message that sends because I acknowledge one good part of the common youth allowance announced this week was the decision to extend rent assistance to some students on the common youth allowance or currently under
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Austudy. But how at odds with that decision was today's decision by the parliament to cut rent assistance by a third. If they are the decisions this government is going to make then young Australians are going to be caught in a poverty cycle.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1996 annual report, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Progress of Nations</EMPHASIS> , produced by the United Nations Children's Fund, paints a depressing picture for women's health, nutrition, education and mortality. Focusing on the indicator of maternal death rates, around 600,000 women die each year in pregnancy or childbirth, 140,000 women die each year as a result of haemorrhaging during childbirth, 75,000 women die each year as a result of attempts to abort themselves, another 75,000 women die with brain and kidney damage during pregnancy, 100,000 die of sepsis and 40,000 die each year due to obstructed labour. In total, 1,600 women around the globe die each day in pregnancy or childbirth and for every woman who dies, approximately 30 more incur injuries, infections and disabilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the evidence that educating girls can result in increased incomes, better child health and nutrition, lower birth rates, and lower maternal and child deaths, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Progress of Nations</EMPHASIS> report finds that 50 per cent of primary school age girls are locked out of the primary education system in Sub&hyphen;Saharan Africa; 22 per cent of girls are excluded from primary school education in the Middle East, Northern Africa, Asia and the Pacific; and seven per cent of primary age girls are not attending school in America or Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst Australia compares favourably on the international league table on the issues of  health, nutrition, education and maternal
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4738"> morbidity, this does not mean that Australian women are immune to such problems. We await the publication of the 1995 national health survey findings, but the 1994 study found a direct link between the reported health status and socioeconomic status of women. Women who reported themselves to be of fair or poor health were 145 per cent more likely to be from low income families than from high income families, 33 per cent more likely to report suffering serious chronic illness and 159 per cent more likely to report suffering mental disorders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indigenous women fared much worse, with the life expectancy of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander females being 20 years less than that of the total Australian female population and indigenous females accounting for almost 15 per cent of all maternal deaths in Australia between 1985 and 1987. Infant mortality in the indigenous population is still over three times that in the total population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With 59,000 females dying in 1995, principally from diseases of the circulatory system and different types of cancer, the central question which remains is how Australia's current health system can be improved to meet the needs of women. A status report on women's health published by Paul Mackey in May 1997 indicates that health policy measures alone will be unable to improve health outcomes and/or address the inequities in the health status of Australian women from different socioeconomic backgrounds. What is required is a holistic approach which addresses health outcomes in conjunction with a range of other measures relating to employment, training and skill development, income support programs and housing. While the 1995 statistics measuring access to health services favour women over men, improving access to health services has not translated into achieving equity in health outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message from the latest earnings parity figures indicates that addressing equity in outcomes is not instantaneous. Despite equal pay decisions dating back almost three decades, women still do not receive the same pay for the same work. In February 1997, women's full&hyphen;time average ordinary weekly earnings were 84 per cent those of men. In
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> May 1996, 63.6 per cent of workers with total earnings of under $100 per week were women and only 20.8 per cent of people with total earnings of $800 per week or above were women. The median total earnings figure for all female employees was $434.20 per week compared with $630 for all male employees. Women remained over&hyphen;represented in the lowest paid jobs, with two&hyphen;thirds of women concentrated in teaching, nursing, clerical work, sales and personal services. In February 1997, only 9.3 per cent of tradespersons and related workers were women, while 90.1 per cent of advanced clerical and service workers were women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government has acknowledged the need for a holistic approach to women's issues, offering women greater choice through policy action in the following key areas: work and family life, employment opportunities, safety, income support and women in decision making. In its policy document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Opportunities and choice for women</EMPHASIS>, the government has confirmed its commitment to the national women's health program and has undertaken to continue existing funding and program arrangements. The program has received an additional two years funding in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding under the program is directed principally towards improving health services for all women. It particularly targets those women who suffer inequality of access to health services due to economic disadvantage, cultural difference or geographic or linguistic isolation. Preliminary findings of the second phase evaluation conclude that the national women's health program has been an effective strategy in giving practical expression to the intent of the national women's health policy. The future of the program will be considered in the context of negotiations for the bilateral public health outcomes funding agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other gender specific measures supported by the coalition government include the alternative birthing services program, which promotes greater choice in birthing for women in the public health system. In relation to breast screening, the Commonwealth has recently undertaken booster television, radio  and print advertising, as part of a strategy to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4739"> achieve a 70 per cent participation rate by asymptomatic women aged 50 to 69 years by 1999. Unmatched funding has also been provided in 1996&hyphen;97 to a number of states for specific projects to increase participation rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government demonstrated its commitment to maternal health in its policy statement <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Health throughout life</EMPHASIS>. Increasing the intake of folic acid by women in childbearing years and encouraging breastfeeding were identified as nutrition measures which can have very positive outcomes for maternal and child health. The sum of $2.4 million has been provided over two years to support these initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to be hosting a seminar directly addressing women's health issues on 1 July 1997. The objective of the seminar is to facilitate action by and discussion between local service providers, peak agencies, departmental representatives and coalition members on the issues affecting women's health and service provision in south&hyphen;western Sydney, including current strategies and future directions. The seminar will focus on four specific case studies, including anti violence and sexual assault campaigns, marginalised women's groups, female genital mutilation and bridging networks between peak agencies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the exceptional and strong build-up of the defence forces in the Top End of the Northern Territory and the many positive influences this is having on territorians at all levels. The Northern Territory has a long and proud history of being at the forefront of Australia's defence. On Thursday, 19 February 1942 at 9.58 a.m., 188 aircraft from the same Japanese force that attacked Pearl Harbour raided Darwin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This first raid killed 243 people and was the first of 64 recorded raids against Darwin and the Top End of Australia. Many people do not realise the extent of the raids, just as now many do not know the impact and importance of the changes currently taking place with regard to our defence forces in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major development affecting the territory is the army presence in the north project. This project stems from the 1987 defence white paper, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defence of Australia</EMPHASIS>, and commenced with the relocation of an armoured reconnaissance regiment in 1992 to Darwin. The subsequent build-up will see the relocation of the army's 1st Brigade and its support elements from Holsworthy and Puckapunyal to Darwin by 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a huge project that is quite staggering in its scope. The numbers of defence personnel arriving in Darwin, the amount of equipment, the capital works that are being undertaken and many other factors are worth relating to help indicate why the Northern Territory is experiencing growth and change that enhance its already unique and fascinating character and make it one of the most important areas for the defence forces in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some $850 million is to be spent on infrastructure development and relocation activities over the 10&hyphen;year period from 1992. I would like to describe some of the major areas and projects in which this very significant sum of money will be spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">APIN involves the relocation to Darwin of approximately 2,300 personnel, 200 armoured fighting vehicles&mdash;leopard tanks, ASLAV light armoured vehicles and M113 armoured personnel carriers&mdash;and 500 support vehicles. This mammoth undertaking also includes all the supporting elements needed to keep such a huge machine running smoothly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The numbers of personnel being transferred to the north are significant and are having a large impact on the territory's social infrastructure, and the housing industry in particular. By the year 2001 Australian Defence Force numbers in the Northern Territory will stand at 4,400&mdash;with the total defence `family', including dependants, well in excess
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4740"> of 10,000 people. This is a huge number of defence personnel and dependants to have based in any one region and is particularly significant when the small population base of the territory is taken into consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Defence, as a major and increasing stakeholder in the Northern Territory, is fully aware of both its contribution to the development of the north and the need to incorporate infrastructure and social planning within broader community frameworks. The move of so many ADF personnel to the north was phased in over 10 years to allow adequate infrastructure and social planning to be implemented and allow defence families to integrate into the NT community. This integration into the community has been handled in a sensible and sensitive manner and perhaps the best example of this is the housing of personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from those single personnel based in Robertson Barracks and other towns in the NT, many of the personnel have been housed in Palmerston, Darwin's satellite city and Australia's fastest growing town. Due to the cooperation between Defence, the NT government and the community, we have not seen suburbs of Palmerston turned into enclaves of defence personnel. Rather we have seen policy and planning that resulted in a socially harmonious mix of defence personnel and civilians that has done a great deal to ensure that defence personnel assimilate into the community with the minimum effort and fuss and a great sense of contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The NT government's Department of Asian Relations, Trade and Industry's Defence and Space Industries Group has played a major role in ensuring that Defence, the community, government and industry work together in the most efficient and acceptable manner possible. They play a large role in organising and facilitating meetings and communication between the defence forces, the community and industry. There are several ways in which this is done, and the Community Integration Committee and the Defence Industry Network Northern Territory are two examples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A major part of the capital works program being conducted to accommodate APIN is the construction of Robertson Barracks at
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Palmerston, 25 kilometres east of Darwin. Robertson Barracks provide state of the art facilities for the army's 1st Brigade, and stage 2 of APIN will see $251 million spent on them over a period of 60 months completing the facility. This will bring the total relocation expenditure to over $500 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to infrastructure such as Robertson Barracks, there are major works being conducted on Bradshaw Station field training area and the Delamere weapons range. These developments are two of many that will see significant expenditure in isolated areas of the Northern Territory and subsequent benefits for nearby communities. The Bradshaw Station field training area will have $54 million spent on developing it as a large-scale bushland facility where it can exercise under monsoonal wilderness conditions. The nearby town of Timber Creek will see significant benefits from the work being conducted and the troops stationed there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also RAAF Base Tindal which will see base development stages 3 and 4 happening in the near future, costing $70 million and $31 million respectively. The town of Katherine is experiencing the benefits&mdash;along with Darwin, Palmerston and various bush areas of the territory&mdash;that come from such a large amount of expenditure and the flow-on effects that follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The APIN project, recent speeches by the Minister for Defence, the Hon. Ian McLachlan, and reports such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defending Australia</EMPHASIS>, the defence white paper of 1994, indicate the importance the defence forces place on the north. Defence activities in the Northern Territory are critical to the maintenance of the defence of Australia and its contribution to the security of the region into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory also places much importance on defence and recognises the major contribution to the territory economy it makes. By the year 2001 defence will be the third largest sector of the Northern Territory economy after tourism and mining. Currently, defence spending in the Northern Territory stands at over $7 million per week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent defence efficiency review and the government's response to the recommen

The effectiveness of our armed forces will be enhanced by the recommendations which flow from the defence efficiency review and the implementation of the defence reform program. We will see an increased emphasis on the `sharp end' of the defence forces. Personnel will be redirected from administration areas into combat and combat support roles. This will not only improve the efficiency and fighting capacity of our forces but will enhance the many benefits received by the Northern Territory from the military.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previously I mentioned that $850 million is to be spent as part of major ongoing infrastructure development and relocation activities in the territory. This is, and will be, spent particularly at Robertson Barracks, RAAF Base Darwin, Darwin Naval Base, Bradshaw Station and RAAF Base Tindal&mdash;several of which I examined in more detail earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This $850 million does not, however, include the continuing and growing defence expenditure on operating costs in the territory which, in 1993, was estimated at about $80 million per year. ADF members in the Northern Territory are paid almost $100 million per year, with most of this flowing into the local economy&mdash;a significant amount of money that has a large role to play in the local economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I have tended to concentrate on the direct economic impact of the Defence Force, such as the benefits generated by capital works, salaries and administration, mention must also be made of the many other areas of economic and social benefit. These include many flow&hyphen;on benefits. Many Defence personnel have highly skilled partners who have made the move to the territory and brought with them their particular skills into the community. These include doctors, nurses, engineers and many more involved in community activities.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to mention the absolutely vital role the commanding officers have played. The RAAF's Vice&hyphen;Marshall Peter Nicholson invested considerable energy in establishing the groundwork for defence in the north from 1992 to 1994. He is now Air Commander Australia. I notice that a former Commander Northern Command, the navy's Commodore John Lord, will soon be promoted rear admiral and take over as Head, Joint Education and Training Canberra. Commander Lord served as Commander of Australia's Northern Command for two years from December 1994. I congratulate him on his recent promotion. He has been succeeded by the army's Brigadier Chris Roberts, who is continuing the fine example of visionary leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a tribute to all of them and their personnel that they have been accepted, welcomed and embraced by the wider community. I acknowledge the important contribution that these families make to the territory economically and socially. There are hundreds of special influences and involvements on sports fields, in education and in commercial activities caused by this defence build&hyphen;up.</PARA>
